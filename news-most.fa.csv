"Iran's recent JCPOA-related steps no threat to NPT","TEHRAN, May 21 (MNA) – Iran's recently announced measures regarding the level of its commitments to the nuclear deal (JCPOA) are not a slightest threat to the nuclear non-proliferation regime, Russian representative to the IAEA said Tuesday. "It [Iran] has already said that it could review the project of modernization of the heavy [water] reactor in Arak and raise the level of uranium enrichment, as a next step. We would not like to see further escalation from any side. I can only say that if Iran makes these steps, not a slightest threat to the nuclear proliferation will be in place, because the most important thing is that Iran does not refuse to implement its commitments under the Additional Protocol about guarantees of the International Atomic Energy Agency .... If it [Iranian nuclear program] is peaceful, than there will be no threat to the nuclear non-proliferation regime or to the international security. So we do not overdramatize [the situation around the JCPOA]," Russia's Permanent Representative to International Organizations in Vienna Mikhail Ulyanov told Sputnik on Tuesday. He stressed that the Additional Protocol was a "powerful and efficient" mechanism for checking whether Iran was implementing its nuclear program exclusively peacefully, UrduPoint quoted Sputnik as saying. "Tehran ... just signals that it is strongly dissatisfied with the current situation, explains why it is dissatisfied and urges the other signatories to make steps to revise the situation. I believe there is no reason to condemn it," Ulyanov added. He further told Sputnik that Russia considers it necessary to hold a meeting of the Joint Commission of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) at the level of political directors, but the date of the meeting has not been set yet, since European signatories are not ready. "I believe our European colleagues are trying to comprehend and process the situation, so the idea to hold a meeting is currently pending," Ulyanov added. Tehran announced its decision to suspend some of its obligations under the JCPOA on May 8, one year after the US abrupt withdrawal from the agreement. On the same day, Iran  gave nuclear deal signatories -- France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Russia, China and the European Union--  an ultimatum, saying it would step up uranium enrichment in 60 days if they did not shield Tehran from sanctions imposed by the United States after Washington quit the pact last year. Tehran said that these measures, which are within the framework of the nuclear deal, were taken in response to Washington violating the JCPOA. MNA/SPUTNIK © 2017 Mehr News Agency.

President Trump has warned about Iran’s determination to pursue nuclear capacity, and it appears he was right on the mark. According to the Iranian state-run IRNA news agency, Behrouz Kamalvandi, the spokesman of the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran, announced that Iran has quadrupled its uranium-enrichment production capacity, saying, “We will soon be crossing the 300-kg limit in several weeks.” Helima Croft, global head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, told CNBC , “We are woefully underappreciating the seriousness of this crisis.” Richard Nephew, a senior research scholar at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy, said, “The comparison here is they were already going 55 miles per hour and heading towards a busted bridge. And so what the AEOI is saying is that they threw a brick on the accelerator. They would have eventually breached the threshold. What they’re saying today is they are deliberately and intentionally trying to breach the threshold faster.” IFP News reported, “Iran made a nuclear announcement recently in reaction to the United States withdrawal from the nuclear deal on 8 May, 2018. The statement of the Supreme National Security Council of Iran said that the country would reduce nuclear commitments under the framework of 2015 nuclear deal, by evading 300-kg limit on the amount of low-enriched uranium, and also 130-tonne limit for storage of heavy water produced at its Arak facility.” Kamalvandi added, “Iran can resume 20 percent enrichment within four days. Whether to conduct the 20-percent enrichment in Natanz or in Fordow is a question that needs to be considered by the Committee to Monitor and Supervise Implementation of the JCPOA at the Iranian Supreme National Security Council.” CNBC noted, “Though uranium must be enriched to 90% to make weapons, much of the work to reach that tipping point has already been done once uranium is enriched within a range of 3% to 4%.” The Daily Mail reports that Kamalvandi said Iran enriched its uranium because the Trump administration had eliminated waivers allowing Iran to trade enriched uranium to Russia in return for unprocessed yellowcake uranium, and also derailed Iran selling heavy water to Oman. As the Daily Mail notes, “Heavy water helps cool reactors producing plutonium that can be used in nuclear weapons. At the rate that Iran is enriching its uranium, the country will soon violate the stockpile limitations set by the Iran nuclear deal, which Europe still clings to but President Trump exited. With tensions simmering between Iran and the U.S., British Defense Secretary Penny Mordaunt indicated that if a conflict breaks out, the U.K. will stand with the U.S. She noted that the U.K. was “already deployed in the region, “ adding, “This is a region where we have a huge stake and a huge amount invested and we are working with our allies and partners to firstly try to de-escalate things in the region but also to truly understand the facts behind recent events.” Mordaunt also said, “The United Kingdom shares the United States’, European and Gulf partners’ concerns about Iran’s destabilizing activities. We continue to work closely with our allies and partners to mitigate the threats to regional security.”","https://www.dailywire.com/news/47504/iran-quadruples-its-uranium-enrichment-capacity-hank-berrien"

"EU to address Iran nuclear deal on Mon.","TEHRAN, May 13 (MNA) – Foreign Ministers of Germany, France and UK will meet EU's foreign policy chief Mogherini on Monday to discuss the Iran nuclear deal following the US’ withdrawal and Iran’s 60-day ultimatum to the remaining parties to the JCPOA. According to German’s DPA news agency, foreign ministers of Germany, France and UK, as the three European signatories to the JCPOA, as well as EU's foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini will hold a special session today to discuss the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which has been in shambles since President Donald Trump withdrew US from it and re-imposed sanctions on Iran. The focus of the meeting in Brussels is to exchange views on ways to continue economic transactions with Iran in the face of US’ unilateral sanctions. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will also take part at the session in Brussels, before heading to Russia, according to The National. This comes as Iran has given the five remaining parties to the nuclear deal a 60-day ultimatum to comply with their commitments, particularly those regarding Iran’s economic interests in the banking and energy sectors, before the country would start reducing portions of its own commitments to the agreement stage by stage. EU was supposed to launch a trade mechanism for Iran, called INSTEX, to do business with the Islamic Republic despite US sanctions. The mechanism has yet to become operational. Iran says at any given time that its demands are met, it will resume complying with the suspended commitments, which have been made impossible to continue due to the US measures and sanctions, according to FM Zarif. The decision to reduce commitments to the JCPOA comes as Washington is ramping up pressure against Iran, by re-imposing new sanctions, including restrictions on Iran's low-level uranium enrichment and metal industry, and ending the sanctions waivers for Iran’s major oil clients in an attempt to drive the country’s oil exports to zero. Iran has stressed that it has no intention to leave the JCPOA, and its decision on reducing commitments is still within the framework of the agreement. MS/IRN83312110 © 2017 Mehr News Agency.

"E3 FMs, Pompeo to Hold Emergency Talks on Iran in Brussels","The foreign ministers of France, Germany, and the UK, EU Foreign Policy Chief Federica Mogherini, and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo are to hold an emergency meeting in Brussels later on Monday to discuss Iran’s recent nuclear announcement. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas, and Mogherini were earlier supposed to discuss Europe’s response to the deadline Iran gave them on Wednesday for the implementation of their commitments under the 2015 nuclear deal. They were also going to confer on their efforts to ensure that trade with Iran will continue despite the US sanctions against the Islamic Republic. Early on Monday, Pompeo announced that he has postponed his planned visit to Russia, and will travel to the Belgian capital for talks on Iran with his European counterparts. On May 8, Iran announced that it would stop exporting excess uranium and heavy water, setting a 60-day deadline for the five remaining parties to the deal – France, the UK, Germany, China, and Russia – to take practical measures toward ensuring Iran’s interests in the face of the American sanctions. In reaction, Mogherini and the E3 foreign ministers released a joint statement, rejecting the deadline given by Iran, while reiterating their commitment to the implementation of the nuclear deal, officially known as Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif later criticized the EU statement, regretting that the bloc was demanding that Tehran unilaterally abide by a multilateral accord, which has already been abrogated by Washington. Iran has warned that it has put a “step-by-step” withdrawal from the JCPOA on its agenda. Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister for Political Affairs Abbas Araqchi said in an interview on Wednesday, “We have not left the JCPOA so far, but we have put such a move on our agenda and that would happen step-by-step.” “No country can accuse Iran of breaching or leaving the nuclear deal,” the diplomat noted, adding that all the measures Tehran has adopted so far, including Wednesday’s move, has been within the deal’s framework.

"Is John Bolton the most dangerous man in the world?","The US is closer to war with Iran than it has been since the Bush years, or perhaps ever. And Bolton is largely to blame  Thu 16 May 2019 07.00 BST   Last modified on Fri 17 May 2019 19.43 BST   Donald Trump’s national security adviser John Bolton wants the United States to go to war with Iran . We know this because he has been saying it for nearly  two  decades . And everything that the Trump administration has done over its Iran policy, particularly since Bolton became Trump’s top foreign policy adviser in April of 2018, must be viewed through this lens, including the alarming US military posturing in the Middle East of the past two weeks. Just after one month on the job, Bolton gave Trump the final push he needed to withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement, which at the time was (and still is, for now) successfully boxing in Iran’s nuclear program and blocking all pathways for Iran to build a bomb. The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) – as the Iran deal is formally known – was the biggest obstacle to Bolton’s drive for a regime change war, because it eliminated a helpful pretext that served so useful to sell the war in Iraq 17 years ago. Since walking away from the deal, the Trump administration has claimed that with a “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran, it can achieve a “better deal” that magically turns Iran into a Jeffersonian democracy bowing to every and any American wish. But this has always been a fantastically bad-faith argument meant to obscure the actual goal (regime change) and provide cover for the incremental steps – the crushing sanctions, bellicose rhetoric, and antagonizing military maneuvers – that have now put the United States closer to war with Iran than it has been since at least the latter half of the Bush administration, or perhaps ever. And Bolton has no qualms about manipulating or outright ignoring intelligence to advance his agenda, which is exactly what’s happening right now. In his White House statement 10 days ago announcing (an already pre-planned) carrier and bomber deployment to the Middle East, Bolton cited “a number of troubling and escalatory indications and warnings” from Iran to justify the bolstered US military presence. But multiple sources who have seen the same intelligence have since said that Bolton and the Trump administration blew it “out of proportion, characterizing the threat as more significant than it actually was”. Even a British general operating in the region pushed back this week, saying he has seen no evidence of an increased Iranian threat. What’s even more worrying is that Bolton knows what he’s doing. He’s “a seasoned bureaucratic infighter who has the skills to press forcefully for his views” – and he has a long history of using those skills to undermine American diplomacy and work toward killing arms control agreements. As a senior official in the George W Bush administration, he played key role in the collapse of the Agreed Framework, the Clinton-era deal that froze North Korea’s plutonium nuclear program (the North Koreans tested their first bomb four years later). He said he “felt like a kid on Christmas day” after he orchestrated the US withdrawal from the international criminal court in 2002. And now as a senior official in the Trump administration, he pushed for the US to withdrawal from a crucial nuclear arms treaty with Russia. While it’s unclear how much of a role he played in scuttling Trump’s negotiations with Kim Jong-un in Hanoi last year, he publicly called for the so-called “Libya model” with the North Koreans (in other words, regime change by force). Just months before joining the administration, he tried to make the legal case for a preventive war against Pyongyang. And if you think he cares about the aftermath of war with North Korea, he doesn’t. Bolton was reportedly “unmoved” by a presentation during his time in the Bush administration of the catastrophic consequences of such a war. “I don’t do war. I do policy,” he said then. So far, Bolton has been successful in moving the United States toward his desired outcome with Iran – if getting the Pentagon to draw up plans to send 120,000 US troops to the region to confront Iran is any indication. There are hopeful signs that we can avoid war, as US officials and our European allies, seemingly alarmed by what Bolton is up to, are sounding the alarm about the Trump administration skewing intelligence on Iran. But Bolton is on a fast track, seemingly aware that Trump’s time in office may be limited. The question, ultimately, is whether the president can stick to his instincts of avoiding more military conflict, or acquiesce to a man hellbent on boxing him into a corner with no way out other than war with Iran.

"Iran Still Doesn’t Want an Escalation","Argument:  Iran Still Doesn’t Want an Escalation  Iran Still Doesn’t Want an Escalation...  By threatening to back away from the nuclear deal last week, Iran seemed to reverse its yearlong policy of strategic patience. So far, however, the country’s actions and announcements indicate that it will stay the course. But patience can easily run out. On May 8, Tehran announced its decision to partially reduce its compliance with the terms of the 2015 nuclear deal (known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA). The move was a response—Iran’s first—to increasing U.S. pressure after the Trump administration decided to leave the agreement last year. Until now, Iran had remained fully compliant with its obligations, as quarterly reports issued by the International Atomic Energy Agency confirm. It has also mainly refrained from escalating tensions in the region through its proxies or retaliating against U.S. provocations, such as Washington’s recent designation of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization . Tehran’s strategic patience was driven by the assumption that, although the status quo was less than ideal, the waiting game would serve Iran better than escalation. The country believed it could ride out the rest of U.S. President Donald Trump’s term in the hope that a new administration would reinstate the JCPOA or adopt a less aggressive posture. Holding back and staying in the agreement would also allow Iran to keep the moral high ground and international support. But Iran’s calculations changed when, in late April, the United States revoked key sanctions waivers that had enabled Iran to continue selling some of its oil to China, India, Japan, South Korea, and Turkey despite the U.S. embargo. The loss of export revenue would further damage an already broken economy. And making things worse, on May 3, the United States also decided to tighten restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program, no longer allowing Tehran to store excess heavy water produced in Oman or swap enriched uranium for raw yellowcake with Russia . With that, it became infinitely less appealing for Iran to stay in the deal. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, who has invested tremendous political capital in the nuclear file since 2013, was left with nothing other than the moral high ground. Senior Iranian officials started to argue that Iran should not only withdraw from the JCPOA but also from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, of which Iran has been a signatory since 1968. It is thus not surprising that Iran was finally pushed into action—or at least the appearance of it. After all, Iran has refrained from actually leaving the deal’s legal framework. Through a statement issued by the Supreme National Security Council (a key institution that brings together Iran’s main national security decision-makers), the country stressed that its steps are fully in line with Sections 26 and 36 of the JCPOA , based on which Iran is entitled to consider the U.S. withdrawal and reintroduction of nuclear-related sanctions as grounds to cease performing its commitments in whole or in part. Meanwhile, the specific ways in which the country is going to roll back its cooperation—stockpiling surplus heavy water and low enriched uranium above the agreed limits without shipping them abroad—are very limited and entirely reversible. Based on preliminary assessments, Iran might even remain within the thresholds of the deal in the short run, further reducing the imminent nuclear threat posed. Finally, although Tehran threatened to resume higher uranium enrichment and halt the Chinese-led effort to redesign its Arak heavy water nuclear reactor, it gave a 60-day window for finding a solution with the remaining signatories to the JCPOA. More specifically, Rouhani clarified that his ultimatum will be enforced only if the remaining signatories don’t make good on their promises to shield the country’s oil and banking sectors from U.S. sanctions. By all appearances, then, Iran is still not interested in unraveling the JCPOA. It just wants to make clear that the status quo, in which the country endures maximum pressure without any tangible benefit in return, is no longer sustainable. Until the 60-day deadline, Iran is likely to test whether the waiting game is still worth playing and continue refraining from escalation. Tensions in the region might still increase over the next few weeks, as demonstrated by Iran’s apparent “ sabotage attack ” of four commercial vessels off the coast of the United Arab Emirates, just outside the Strait of Hormuz. However, similar to what happened over the past year, escalation is unlikely to be a strategy proactively sought by Iran but rather the product of accidents or miscalculations. Much of what happens after the July 7 deadline will depend on whether Tehran believes that incremental gains are still possible. And those depend on the ability of the remaining signatories to the JCPOA to offer concrete benefits, not just political ones, to Iran in exchange for continued constraint. It will not be easy, but Europe will need to make quick progress operationalizing INSTEX, the payment mechanism that France, Germany, and the United Kingdom developed to facilitate legitimate trade with Iran without incurring into U.S. sanctions. It will also have to find ways for Iran to sell its oil. Following Iran’s announcement, European capitals renewed their commitments to the preservation of the JCPOA and to get INSTEX up and running soon. It is less clear whether they’ll put any effort into addressing the oil sales issue. It is harder to imagine a change of heart on the U.S. side, but at least some sections of the Iranian leadership are not without hope. Officials such as Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif have signaled their willingness to work with Trump. On April 24, just days after the oil waivers were revoked, Zarif offered to negotiate a prisoner exchange with the United States and stressed that the U.S. president, unlike others in his administration, seems keen to talk to Tehran. Trump himself recently opened up to the possibility of direct talks with Tehran to make “a fair deal.” Although he is unlikely to turn U.S. Iran policy on its head in less than two months, any signal that he’s willing to be constructive might induce Iran to stick with strategic patience a while longer. Over the next few weeks, Iran will decide whether its existing strategy still serves its purpose or, instead, escalation in the region better matches its national security interests. With so much at stake, all the parties involved need to carefully assess the costs and potential consequences the latter path would have for Iran, the region, and, ultimately, the world.

"Report to Congress on Iran’s Nuclear Program","Iran’s nuclear program began during the 1950s. The United States has expressed concern since the mid-1970s that Tehran might develop nuclear weapons. Iran’s construction of gas centrifuge uranium enrichment facilities is currently the main source of proliferation concern. Gas centrifuges can produce both low-enriched uranium (LEU), which can be used in nuclear power reactors, and weapons-grade highly enriched uranium (HEU), which is one of the two types of fissile material used in nuclear weapons. The United States has assessed that Tehran possesses the technological and industrial capacity to produce nuclear weapons. But Iran has not yet mastered all of the necessary technologies for building such weapons. Whether Iran has a viable design for a nuclear weapon is unclear. A National Intelligence Estimate made public in 2007 assessed that Tehran “halted its nuclear weapons program” in 2003. The estimate, however, also assessed that Tehran is “keeping open the option to develop nuclear weapons” and that any decision to end a nuclear weapons program is “inherently reversible.” U.S. intelligence officials have reaffirmed this judgment on several occasions. Obtaining fissile material is widely regarded as the most difficult task in building nuclear weapons. As of January 2014, Iran had produced an amount of LEU containing up to 5% uranium-235, which, if further enriched, could theoretically have produced enough HEU for as many as eight nuclear weapons. Iran had also produced LEU containing nearly 20% uranium-235; the total amount of this LEU, if it had been in the form of uranium hexafluoride and further enriched, would have been sufficient for a nuclear weapon.. After the Joint Plan of Action, which Tehran concluded with China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States (collectively known as the “P5+1”), went into effect in January 2014, Iran either converted much of its LEU containing nearly 20% uranium-235 for use as fuel in a research reactor located in Tehran, or prepared it for that purpose. Iran has diluted the rest of that stockpile so that it contained no more than 5% uranium-235. In addition, Tehran has implemented various restrictions on, and provided the IAEA with additional information about, its nuclear program pursuant to the July 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which Tehran concluded with the P5+1. Although Iran claims that its nuclear program is exclusively for peaceful purposes, the program has generated considerable concern that Tehran is pursuing a nuclear weapons program. The U.N. Security Council responded to Iran’s refusal to suspend work on its uranium enrichment program by adopting several resolutions that imposed sanctions on Tehran. Despite evidence that sanctions and other forms of pressure have slowed the program, Iran continued to enrich uranium, install additional centrifuges, and conduct research on new types of centrifuges. Tehran has also worked on a heavy-water reactor, which was a proliferation concern because its spent fuel would have contained plutonium—the other type of fissile material used in nuclear weapons. However, plutonium must be separated from spent fuel—a procedure called “reprocessing.” Iran has said that it will not engage in reprocessing. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) monitors Iran’s nuclear facilities and has verified that Tehran’s declared nuclear facilities and materials have not been diverted for military purposes. The agency has also verified that Iran’s compliance with the JCPOA. On the JCPOA’s Implementation Day, which took place on January 16, 2016, all of the previous Security Council resolutions’ requirements were terminated. The nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) and U.N. Security Council Resolution 2231, which the council adopted on July 20, 2015, compose the current legal framework governing Iran’s nuclear program. Iran has continued to comply with the JCPOA and Resolution 2231. Iran and the IAEA agreed in 2007 on a work plan to clarify outstanding questions regarding Tehran’s nuclear program, most of which concerned possible Iranian procurement activities and research directly applicable to nuclear weapons development. A December 2015 report to the IAEA Board of Governors from agency Director-General Yukiya Amano contains the IAEA’s “final assessment on the resolution” of these outstanding issues. Then-Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Wendy Sherman explained during an October 2013 hearing of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations that Iran would need as much as one year to produce a nuclear weapon if the government decided to do so. At the time, Tehran would have needed two to three months to produce enough weapons-grade HEU for a nuclear weapon. Iran’s compliance with the JCPOA has increased that time frame to one year, according to U.S. officials. These estimates apparently assume that Iran would use its declared nuclear facilities to produce fissile material for a weapon. However, Tehran would probably use covert facilities for this purpose; Iranian efforts to produce fissile material for nuclear weapons by using its known nuclear facilities would almost certainly be detected by the IAEA.

"","Last Sunday the USA dispatched an aircraft carrier strike group and a bomber task force to the Middle East to put pressure on Iran. On Friday, US B-52 bombers landed in Qatar. The agreement on the Iran nuclear deal framework was reached in 2015 between Iran and the P5+1 comprising the USA, the UK, Russia, France, and China plus Germany. Iran was required to redesign, convert, and reduce its nuclear facilities and accept the Additional Protocol. As Iran fully abided by the agreement, all nuclear-related economic sanctions were lifted, freeing up tens of billions of dollars in oil revenue and frozen assets. Major European companies rushed to Iran to benefit from a lucrative market and for energy imports. There were hopes also that the Pak-Iran gas pipeline would now be revived. US President Trump made a U-turn by rejecting the Iran nuclear deal, and launched crippling sanctions against Iran that pushed the Iranian economy to the brink. Iran’s oil exports consequently dwindled from 2.5 million to less than 1.3 million barrels a day and are about to drop even further. The Iranian people, who are already suffering from the raging inflation, currently at 40 percent, would bear the brunt of Washington’s push to bring Iranian oil exports to zero. The Trump Administration is making unjustified and humiliating demands that require total Iranian surrender, not only to the USA, but also to Israel and President Trump’s Gulf allies. A blockade of Iran could lead to retaliation, causing oil shortages and raising oil prices sky-high. Any attack on Iran will be seen in Pakistan as an attempt to destroy yet another stable Muslim country after Iraq, Syria and Libya. Pakistan is still paying heavily for the consequences of the US aggression in Afghanistan. It has lost thousands of civilians and soldiers in attacks by the offshoots of the jihadi network that had been let loose in Afghanistan by the CIA and its allies. One expects Prime Minister Imran Khan to send a clear and unambiguous message to the USA to desist from any military action against Iran as it would have serious consequences for the region, particularly Pakistan which is yet to fully overcome its internal security problems.

"Iran Wants a Way out of Crisis, but America Won't Give It One","Why is Washington putting Tehran in a corner? On the anniversary of America’s withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), more commonly known as the Iran nuclear deal, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani announced a series of measures reducing Iran’s strict implementation of the deal. Iran’s policy up to this point had been characterized as trying to wait out the Trump administration, but with well over year left to 2020 election, it’s worth examining the ways in which this decision affects international dynamics moving forward. Iran’s decision is a carefully designed strategy of gradual partial withdrawal that intends to impose costs on the Trump administration for their rapid escalation of sanctions and on the Europeans for their anemic response. This represents the middle ground of two unacceptable paths for Iran. The first would be to allow the United States to escalate without consequences. The second would be to fully withdraw from the JCPOA. Withdrawal would destroy the framework that took over two years to negotiate and possibly win President Donald Trump’s hardline approach new followers. For the remainder of the Trump administration, this sets up a dynamic where Iran will continue to meet U.S. sanctions escalation with its own controlled escalation through a gradual withdraw from its nuclear obligations. In doing so, Iran hopes to modify the behavior of the Trump administration and impact the campaign calculations of Democrats seeking to defeat Trump in 2020. Tehran also wants to generate urgency among other parties, especially Europe, to confront Washington’s historic discarding of international norms and agreements. Since the United States recognizes no moral or legal barrier towards its uninhibited escalation against Iran, only reciprocal escalation can even theoretically modify U.S. behavior. Specifically, if Iran only concentrated on heavy water and low enriched uranium (LEU), this would maintain the focus on the Trump administration’s intransigence. This is because LEU and heavy water are not themselves useful in building nuclear weapons. Additionally, nuclear cooperation is key for Iran to continue observing JCPOA limits on those items as they were recently sanctioned by the United States. Iran also threatened to discard more sensitive sections of its JCPOA commitments involving the Arak plutonium reactor and levels of uranium enrichment that would theoretically shorten Iran’s time towards achieving nuclear breakout—the accumulation of enough highly enriched uranium to build one nuclear weapon—which was central to the calculation employed in the JCPOA. But Iran’s continued support for IAEA inspections makes clear that Iran demands its interlocutors take their obligations seriously while Tehran is clearly not sprinting towards weaponization. This accumulative effect allows Iran to impose a cost on western countries without losing the moral high ground. Iran recognizes that its interest lies squarely with bringing all parties back into implementation with the JCPOA and not allowing the United States to burn bridges back to that goal by trapping Iran into a full retaliatory withdrawal. Cost and a Cudgel  Iran is hoping its phased partial withdrawal strategy from the deal generates the kind of pressure that helped bring about the JCPOA negotiations with the Obama administration. During the negotiations, it became fashionable in Washington to argue that sanctions brought Iran to the table. This narrative holds that Iran’s decision to negotiate was driven exclusively by U.S. sanctions and pressure. This narrative became common wisdom in Washington for the most conventional of reasons: both political parties saw value in advancing it. The Obama administration believed that the public’s appraisal of their approach may hinge on the perception that America is negotiating from a position of strength. The Republicans, meanwhile, wished to argue that if some pressure is good, more would be better—that if sanctions forced Iran to make concessions, then more sanctions would yield more results. In fact, the United States, by default, recognized Iran’s right to enrich uranium and moved away from hardline “zero enrichment” demands during the preliminary talks that set the stage for JCPOA negotiations. This was spurred by pressure from Iran in the form of a booming number of centrifuges and enrichment uranium stockpiles as well as economic adjustment to sanctions that put Washington’s more aggressive demands out of reach. Whether the cost imposed on America in the form of Iran’s phased withdrawal actually modifies the nature or aggressiveness of U.S. escalation may well depend on whether Iranian policy alters the process of policy formulation inside the Trump administration. In his interview with Fox News Sunday, Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said National Security Advisor John Bolton and various American allies in the Middle East “have all shown an interest in dragging the United States into a conflict. I do not believe that President Trump wants to do that, I believe President Trump ran on a campaign promise of not bringing the United States into another war.” Bolton, Pompeo and Trump  Bolton has established himself as the most militaristic influence in the Washington foreign policy community. Bolton’s infamous revulsion towards diplomacy and lust for crushing enemies through military conflict is so extreme it makes Senate Republicans uncomfortable . Pompeo was also a notably hawkish lawmaker before joining the Trump administration. Both Pompeo and Bolton have previously called for regime change in Iran and for the United States to initiate military conflict with Iran even as the nuclear negotiations were ongoing. Furthermore, Bolton and Pompeo have a historic opportunity to pursue regime change around the world as proof of concept for their vision of America eliminating any entity that questions Washington’s primacy through escalation dominance. They will likely, however, have to do so without being able to formally initiate a war as America did in Iraq. Trump is unlikely to be willing to initiate a new conflict that could overtake his presidency the way the Iraq war eventually did with George W. Bush. Trump himself famously supported the Iraq war before running against it in his Presidential campaign, calling the conflict a “ big fat mistake .” He in the past joked that he would not allow Bolton to get him into war and recently fumed that Bolton was doing just that regarding the failed regime change endeavor in Venezuela. Bolton and Pompeo are wagering that unilateral pressure on Iran would be more successful than the kind of coalitional pressure that requires consensus building and compromise. They believe that the United States can leverage its centrality to international financial networks, internet communication and key points in the global supply chain to impose its will on financial and economic institutions around the world. It is certainly possible that hardline elements of the Trump administration sold their Iran strategy as an easy win against a country that will serve as historic proof of American power and burnish Trump’s own “America First” credentials. Bolton once promised that his policy prescription would bring regime change by 2019 . The critical question here is how much cost and potential of war Trump is willing to tolerate for the success of this “maximum pressure campaign”? How does Iran’s imposition of cost factor into Trump giving his most hardline advisers a free hand regarding Iran policy? The efforts of the United Kingdom, France, and Germany (collectively known as the E3) to replace the benefits of America’s participation in the JCPOA have largely failed and promise to continue making little meaningful impact. The E3 has clearly prioritized the protection of their trade and security ties with America over protecting the JCPOA or Iran’s fair dividends from it. The reactions from European capitals to President Rouhani’s announcement were generally balanced and composed. But at least as so far as they threatened the reimpose European sanctions (the United Kingdom and France have), their reaction was still more aggressive than any they had put forth against Trump after one year of Washington leaving the JCPOA. This was even in the face of Washington trying to break the Iran Deal and threatening European business executives with multibillion-dollar fines and imprisonment should they breach American extraterritorial diktat. Europe is clearly more comfortable with holding an aggressive line towards Iran but, as few European companies remain active in Iran, the threat of their economic reprisal carries little fear for Tehran. Washington’s bolder policy has rendered Europe strategically irrelevant. It dares not lash out against Washington even as Washington’s policies rob Europe of its power to affect the world. A Europe divided and distracted with internal ideological struggle is not likely to either stand up to Trump or destroy the still standing JCPOA framework by reimposing EU sanctions. The Europeans will most likely continue the current track of providing Iran with rhetorical support and token benefits while tolerating Iran’s gradual withdrawal as long as the IAEA has enough transparency to certify that no sprint towards breakout is in progress.  © Copyright 2019 Center for the National Interest All Rights Reserved","https://nationalinterest.org/blog/middle-east-watch/iran-wants-way-out-crisis-america-wont-give-it-one-57732"
"Spain Wants Nothing to Do With America’s Iran Strategy","The Spanish government on May 14, 2019 announced its navy would not, as previously planned, send a guided-missile frigate to join the battle group of the U.S. Navy aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln . The United States is already losing a close ally in its rush to justify military action against Iran. The Spanish government on May 14, 2019 announced its navy would not, as previously planned, send a guided-missile frigate to join the battle group of the U.S. Navy aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln . Washington in early May 2019 expedited  Lincoln ’s planned deployment to the Middle East after officials with the Trump administration claimed they had received intelligence indicating Iranian forces planned to attack American interests. “The U.S. government has taken a decision outside of the framework of what had been agreed with the Spanish navy,” Spain’s acting defense minister Margarita Robles told reporters in Brussels. In addition to speeding up Lincoln ’s deployment, the Pentagon also sent a contingent of U.S. Air Force B-52s to the Middle East as part of a wider build-up of forces in the region. The bombers on May 12, 2019 flew their first “deterrence” sorties near Iran. Air Force F-15C and F-35A fighters around the same time flew their own show-of-force missions. U.S. president Donald Trump’s national security advisor John Bolton, who has vowed to force regime change in Tehran, reportedly ordered acting defense secretary Patrick Shanahan to update plans for a possible war with Iran. The plan “envisions sending as many as 120,000 troops to the Middle East should Iran attack American forces or accelerate work on nuclear weapons,” The New York Times  reported . The planning documents “do not call for a land invasion of Iran, which would require vastly more troops, officials said.” The size of the force involved has shocked some who have been briefed on them. The 120,000 troops would approach the size of the American force that invaded Iraq in 2003. Deploying such a robust air, land and naval force would give Tehran more targets to strike, and potentially more reason to do so, risking entangling the United States in a drawn out conflict. It also would reverse years of retrenching by the American military in the Middle East that began with Pres. Barack Obama’s withdrawal of troops from Iraq in 2011. The government of Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly supplied the intelligence that the Trump administration used to justify, which routinely lies about basic facts, has not supplied to the public any evidence of a heightened threat from Iran. The administration has pointed to recent incidents that it claims were Iranian attacks on U.S. allies. Saudi and Emirati authorities claimed four oil tankers came under attack in the Persian Gulf on May 13, 2019 and all four suffered damage. U.S. military officials blame Iran, despite a lack of evidence that all four tankers indeed were damaged -- and that any damage was the result of an attack. A British general on May 14, 2019 insisted he had seen “no increased threat from Iranian-backed forces” in Iraq and Syria. Many recent attacks on Saudi oil infrastructure and shipping have been blamed on Houthi fighters from Yemen. Explosives-laden Houthi drones on May 14, 2019 reportedly damaged oil pipelines on Saudi soil. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates both are at war with the Houthis in Yemen. There is tenuous evidence that the Houthis receive some support from Iran. But there is no evidence that recent attacks on tankers and pipelines are part of a new and coordinated campaign by Iran to damage U.S. interests. The Trump administration for years has antagonized Iran. The administration in 2018 withdrew from the 2015 international agreement limiting Iran’s nuclear program. Iran in response pulled back from some aspects of the agreement, but with strong European support largely has continued to abide by its terms. Many observers in the United States fear the Trump White House wants war with Iran for political benefit or as part of an ideologically-motivated scheme to “remake” the Middle East. A scheme that would amount to a repeat of the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. “Similar to the George W. Bush administration’s justification for the war in Iraq, the Trump administration has presented the false narratives that Iran is not meeting its obligations under the nuclear deal and that it is somehow partially responsible for the rise of the Islamic State in Syria,” U.S. senators Tom Udall, a New Mexico Democrat, and Richard Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, warned in an op-ed. “It’s true that the leaders of Iran are deeply problematic. But if this were enough to justify war, other regimes in the region would also be in the United States’ crosshairs, instead of being recipients of U.S. military aid,” Udall and Durbin wrote, referring to oil-rich Saudi Arabia. Saudi money funds a vast network of extremist religious institutions that underpin modern Islamic terrorism. Trump has aligned himself with Saudi rulers and even exempted the country from an otherwise highly indiscriminate ban on people from many mostly-Muslim countries traveling to the United States.

"Fear the Mustache: Why Bolton Makes Even Donald Trump Nervous","The normal aggressiveness of the U.S. military force does not satisfy Bolton; he wants the United States to deepen its aggressiveness. White House National Security Advisor John Bolton talks to reporters outside of the White House West Wing April 30, 2019 in Washington, DC. Bolton answered questions about the security and political turmoil in Venezuela and called for a peaceful transition to a government controlled by acting President Juan Guaido. (Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) Even U.S. President Donald Trump, who is getting ready to pardon war criminals, fears John Bolton. Trump had hesitated to give Bolton a seat in his Cabinet (initially because of Trump’s distaste for Bolton’s bushy mustache). Bolton and General H.R. McMaster were both in line to become National Security Adviser (NSA). Trump went with H.R. McMaster, who lasted a year. Bolton, called “The Mustache” by Trump, slipped into this consequential post. The NSA is the main adviser to the U.S. president on foreign policy—often more important than the Secretary of State. Bolton has Trump’s ear. Trump, mercurial in his policy-making, therefore, has the world’s most dangerous man whispering at him. As his trigger finger tightened with Iran in the gunsights, Trump said of Bolton, “if it was up to John, we’d be in four wars now.” Bolton is on record saying that he would like to turn the immense force of the U.S. military against Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Venezuela. These are likely the “four wars” that Trump mentioned. These would be additional wars, for the United States remains actively at war in Afghanistan as well as in Iraq and Syria. The United States currently operates over 100 military bases—many of them in active operations—around the world. The normal aggressiveness of the U.S. military force does not satisfy Bolton; he wants the United States to deepen its aggressiveness. Bolton is much like the typical war hawk. Such people want to send others to war. They don’t want to go to war themselves. Bolton smartly went into the National Guard in 1970. In a Yale reunion book, he wrote, “I confess I had no desire to die in a Southeast Asian rice paddy. I considered the war in Vietnam already lost.” When Bolton made this personal decision, his heroes—Nixon and Kissinger—began their illegal and barbaric bombing of Cambodia and Laos. Between Bolton’s decision not to go to Vietnam and the U.S. retreat from Saigon, 3,304 U.S. soldiers died as well as uncounted numbers of Vietnamese, Cambodian and Laotian people. In government for most of his life, Bolton worked hard against the good side of history. A key part of Bolton’s work was to help the cover-up of the Reagan administration’s role in supporting the Contras and in the Iran-Contra affair. After the left-wing Sandinistas came to power in Nicaragua in 1979, first the Carter and then the Reagan administration assisted the military and the oligarchy to form la contrarrevolución (the Counter-Revolution) or the Contras. Trained by the United States, the Contras used the most brutal methods against ordinary people to undermine the Sandinista government. When the U.S. Congress—pushed by public opinion—stopped overt U.S. funding for the Contras, the Reagan administration illegally sold arms to Iran, whose profits went to fund the Contras. This was the Iran-Contra scandal. Bolton fought to block Senator John Kerry’s attempts to investigate drug-smuggling and gun-running by the Contras in Nicaragua. He refused to allow documents on the Iran-Contra affair to be turned over to Congressman Peter Rodino. Bolton did the heavy work for the administration, which nonetheless found his language to be often “contentious and intemperate”—as White House spokesperson Marlin Fitzwater said in 1987. Intemperateness is the mood of Bolton. In 1994, he said of the UN Secretariat building in New York that if it “lost ten stories, it wouldn’t make a bit of difference.” Chilling words. Bolton lived them. He spent years trying to undermine any decent arms control treaty in the United Nations framework and he spent years trying to shield the United States from any international accountability. In 2000, Bolton ridiculed the “Church of Arms Control”—the phrase a clear indication of his attitude to peace, one shared with large sections of the U.S. ruling class. It was Bolton who pushed the George W. Bush administration in 2001 to walk away from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972, an act that sent belligerent signals to Moscow. It was Bolton again who egged Bush in 2003 on to smash the Agreed Framework of 1994 between the United States and North Korea. When U.S. intelligence—whose credibility was damaged by the Iraq materials—said that North Korea had begun to enrich uranium, there was to be no further dialogue. Bolton later wrote, “This was the hammer I had been looking for to shatter the Agreed Framework.” It was Bolton once more who urged Trump to depart from the Iran nuclear deal, and most chillingly it was Bolton who killed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty of 1988. Bolton’s record is clear. But so are his words, not only his speeches, but also his deeply informative book—Surrender Is Not An Option (2008). The contours of Bolton’s vision are clear in both the acts and in the words. The fulcrum of his thinking is this: that U.S. power must be unchecked, and it must be used to ensure the perpetuity of U.S. domination. There will be no surrender to any multi-polarity or to bi-polarity (China and the United States). U.S. domination is absolute and should be permanent. Few U.S. elected officials have the guts to disagree with this disagreeable worldview. They salute the flag and send the bombers to spread the stars and stripes across the globe. What are the hindrances for this permanent and absolute U.S. dominion? The United Nations, and any international treaty or body, should not be allowed to interfere with U.S. actions. The UN must be “reformed,” says the U.S. regime, which means that the UN should be brought to the heel of the White House. The European Union, which pretends to be superior to the United States, must not be allowed its “endless process of diplomatic mastication,” wrote Bolton in his book. It must be silenced. The substantial adversaries of the United States—Russia and China—must be cut down, their vulnerabilities used against them. Sanctions are an effective tool here, since to go to war with them would be, even for Bolton, suicidal. Overthrow of the main allies of Russia and China—places such as Venezuela and Iran—would further weaken these aspirant states. Regime change against countries such as Venezuela and Iran, as well as Cuba and North Korea, would not only weaken Russia and China but it would also send a strong message that no one should ever defy the United States. Bolton has a coherent worldview. His hawkish peers—both Republicans and Democrats—don’t have his nerve. They’ll back this regime change war (Venezuela) or that (Iran). They will do so pretending that they are being pragmatic and are responding to “intelligence.” But none of these wars of aggression—whether against Iraq or Iran, Afghanistan or Venezuela—are merely driven by pragmatism. Bolton lays out the full agenda. He is more a mainstream U.S. intellectual than the mainstream would like to admit. The U.S. mainstream is Bolton with manner. Their normalcy is merely Bolton’s philosophy in bits and pieces.  Vijay Prashad is the Director of Tricontinental: Institute for Social Research and Chief Editor of LeftWord Books .

"America versus Iran: Confrontation from hell","17 M/CLOUDY    CANBERRA - Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power once called genocidal wars “a problem from hell.” As U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration ratchets up tensions with Iran, the world must now reckon with the prospect of a “confrontation from hell” between the two countries. For now, both the United States and Iran say they do not want a war. Yet, step by inexorable step, they are moving onto a collision course. The U.S. has significantly stepped up its military deployment in Iran’s neighborhood, dispatching the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier strike group and a bomber task force to the Middle East to warn the Iranian regime against taking any threatening actions. Iran’s leaders, meanwhile, have decried the move as psychological warfare and regard it as a provocation aimed at drawing their country into a military conflict.  Since he took office, Trump has been relentless in his depiction of Iran as the source of all evil — including international terrorism — in the region and beyond. He has reversed his predecessor Barack Obama’s policy of engagement and is exerting maximum pressure on the Iranian regime with three objectives in mind. First and foremost, the Trump administration wants to bring about regime change, or at least a change in the regime’s behavior. It also seeks to degrade Iran’s economy so that the country can no longer be an influential regional player. And it wants to shore up Israel’s position as America’s most loyal and powerful ally in the Middle East, and to forge close strategic ties between the Jewish state and Arab countries opposed to Iran, including the Gulf states — led by Saudi Arabia — and Egypt. To achieve these objectives, Trump has withdrawn the U.S. from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). His administration has imposed harsh sanctions on Iran that affect every sector of its economy, leading some foreign companies to stop doing business with the country. And in an unprecedented move last month, Trump designated the key branch of Iran’s military forces, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, as a terrorist organization. Trump’s hawkish national security adviser, John Bolton, backed by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, recently said: “The United States is not seeking war with the Iranian regime, but we are fully prepared to respond to any attack, whether by proxy, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or regular Iranian forces.” This takes the U.S. and Iran a step closer to a military confrontation that could be triggered either intentionally or by miscalculation. In the event of a war, Iran would not have the military capacity to stand up to American firepower. The U.S. could quickly take out Iranian military installations, nuclear sites and major infrastructure facilities. In addition, it could prevent Iran from blocking the Strait of Hormuz, through which some 30 percent of the world’s oil is shipped. Yet Iran is capable of making any U.S. military assault — with or without Israeli and Saudi Arabian support — very costly for America and the region. The Iranian regime may be able to sink a few ships at the Strait of Hormuz’s narrowest point — where the shipping lanes in either direction are only 3.2 kilometers wide — in an effort to choke it off. More important, Iran has nurtured an asymmetric warfare strategy based on both hard and soft power. Although Iran lacks a modern frontline air force, for example, it has made significant progress in developing and producing short-, medium- and long-range missiles that have the capacity to hit targets as far away as Israel. Furthermore, the regime could target landmarks such as the Burj Khalifa in Dubai — the world’s tallest building — in order to trigger a financial meltdown across the region. Even if the accuracy of Iranian missiles cannot be guaranteed, many of them could still evade defensive systems. Israel’s state-of-the-art Iron Dome anti-missile defenses, for example, have been unable even to neutralize all the primitive missiles launched from Gaza. Moreover, the Iranian regime has forged a network of proxy forces across the region. Syria and Iraq have become crucial links in an Iran-led Shiite strategic arc stretching from Afghanistan to Lebanon. The regime’s proxy forces include segments of Afghanistan’s Shiite population, Iraqi Shiite militias and Hezbollah, which controls southern Lebanon and has thousands of rockets ready to target Israel. Indeed, Hezbollah emerged from its 2006 war with Israel stronger than before. In addition, Iran can mobilize thousands of extremely dedicated suicide bombers to sacrifice themselves for the cause of Shiite Islam and nationalism that the regime has successfully promoted. These bombers are embedded within the Iranian security forces, and across the region. The Iranian regime has worked hard to strengthen its national security within a supportive regional framework. In a conflict with the U.S., therefore, Iran would not be a pushover. On the contrary, any major military assault could result in an uncontrollable regional inferno.

"Trump's Iran Policy is Emboldening Hawkish Democrats","Some influential Democratic foreign-policy experts are recommending that Trump's Iran policy be refined, rather than discarded. Democratic candidates for president are already taking positions on whether they would honor the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The deal was negotiated by the Obama administration along with other international partners but the Trump administration has refused to honor it, raising tensions with Iran and European allies who see the deal as essential. Senators Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, along with two lesser-known candidates, told Al-Monitor that they would return to the deal without precondition, as long as Iran continues to abide by the deal. Another candidate, former Housing Secretary Julian Castro, then announced his support for that approach. But increasingly some in the Democratic Party’s foreign policy trust have been recommending approaches that hew closely to Trump’s overall policy. Former Obama administration officials Eric Brewer and Ilan Goldenberg, now at the Center for New American Security, argue that Iran abiding by the term of the nuclear deal should be discounted as unilateral concessions and that America returning to its commitments should be contingent on Iran agreeing to a completely new set of American demands. They write that “[s]ince Tehran has decided that abiding by the nuclear deal is in its interests despite Washington’s withdrawal, a U.S. return and the corresponding sanctions relief would essentially be a unilateral concession to Iran. Washington will have the ability to ask for something in return.” Former State Department official PJ Crowley argues that “even though Trump has taken the wrong approach for the wrong reasons, Democratic candidates should not ignore the leverage his strategy has created.” Obama era officials Richard Nephew and Robert Einhorn are calling for the discarding of the JCPOA in favor of an entirely new negotiation in which Iran would make concessions so deep and structural that the ensuing deal would garner broad support in Washington, presumably even from Republicans. They hint at “improving” sanctions relief for Iran but also call for new “sanctions, counter-proliferation measures, and deterrence.” A Policy Refined, Not Discarded  What these influential Democratic foreign policy experts are recommending is not a discarding of Trump’s policy, but a limited refining of it. They all, Nephew and Einhorn especially, go to great pains to disassociate their proposal from Trump, but what they recommend largely amounts to the rhetorical reframing of Trump’s Iran policy and a scaling back some of the uber-maximalist demands issued by Pompeo. Many analysts have argued that Europe and Iran are essentially waiting out Donald Trump, holding firm to the existing terms of the deal and hoping that a future Democratic president would return to international norms. But this strategy, even if a Democrat is elected, seems increasingly unviable as Democratic foreign policy hands warm up to Trump’s approach. The recommendations of the aforementioned Democratic Party experts assume that Iran will simply calculate that making more concessions will be worth the sanctions relief. But from the Iranian standpoint, if Tehran validates the notion that abrogating an agreement generates “leverage,” why would any hypothetical future agreement be honored? As no concession Iran would realistically make could satisfy the full spectrum of demands Washington has of Iran, any deal would naturally be followed by more sanctions and more demands. An honest observer of Washington would have to admit that Iran even giving credence to this policy framework would be welcomed in Congress with a raft of new sanctions legislation meant to boost “leverage.” Crowley claims that the Iranian public, weary of economic pain, would demand the United States receive satisfaction in exchange for sanctions relief. This is also a flawed assumption. Recent polling data from Iran makes clear that Iranians overwhelmingly believe that international interlocutors will not abide by their promises. Iran may present an unproven environment for polling accuracy but the results are unsurprising. The American approach in question promises assuredly temporary and anemic sanctions relief in exchange for an internationally unprecedented spectrum of new security concessions no country has ever made without losing a war. No amount of economic hardship can modify this position if the promised benefits of a deal seem like a mirage. Brewer and Goldenberg do mention that nuclear negotiations carried the theoretical possibility of dealing with non-nuclear issues at a later point. But that was based on the Obama administration engaging in diplomatic conflict resolution and building confidence through mutual implementation. President Rouhani referred to this as a “ win-win ” proposition and made it a key feature of his case for the JCPOA before a hesitant Iranian body politic. The United States violating the deal and a return to what Stephen Walt described as a diplomatic posture reliant “excessively on ultimatums and coercive pressure” obviously poisons that well. Consequences of Norms  In politics, both domestic and international norms supplement laws to create mutually beneficial safety and civility. Actors abide by norms because of the implication that violating them would provoke retaliation by both friend and foe undermining the overarching policy. Trump’s politics presupposes that the disadvantages of breaking norms are simply overstated. He assumes, and is often proven correct , that other actors will largely fear that aggressive reaction or a tit-for-tat discarding of norms as being more dangerous to their interests than trying to reinforce them with their own faithfulness. Trump’s decision to leave the JCPOA is a projection of that viewpoint on the international stage. Its success ensures that other actors continue to be restrained by norms while the norms breaker enjoys new strategic flexibility. Europeans’ promises to introduce new measures to protect their business ties with Iran are failing in no small part because of Trump’s assumption about their tepid response to his norms-breaking came to fruition. As the Washington Post  observed , in the opinion of “industry associations, government officials, analysts and representatives of companies that have been targeted, [i]n the struggle to determine whether the nuclear deal lives or dies, the United States has been willing to cross boundaries that Europe has, thus far, been reluctant to push.” Democrats are now internalizing this lesson. Einhorn and Nephew acknowledge that Iran may leave the deal. However, Crowley, Goldenberg and Brewer base their analysis on the assumption that Iran not having left the JCPOA so far represents an irreversible decision never to do so. This is a deeply problematic assumption underpinning a dangerous miscalculation. European efforts to save the JCPOA are now reaching the implementation phase with little hope of meaningful success and the chorus of cynicism towards the JCPOA is both louder and coming from the pinnacles of Iran’s nuclear agency and governing structure . Europe’s failure to provide Iran with meaningful economic benefits make Iran’s continued implementation of the JCPOA a strategic disadvantage, emboldening both Trump and the most hawkish instincts of establishment Democrats. For Europeans, Iran’s continued implementation makes the destabilizing nature of Trump’s policy seem manageable, but for Iran, the effect on its economy is real. This represents an inflection point; another will come during the presidential election next year. Iranian policymakers typically chafe at the idea of making policy decisions based on campaign season rhetoric, but as the last presidential election and the ensuing Trump policies proved, policy frameworks adopted on the campaign trail are not easily supplanted by conventional assessments of interest after the election. Iran may not necessarily fully leave the JCPOA. Policymakers in Tehran can take steps reducing its participation in the JCPOA, such as reinstalling centrifuges and increasing the level of enrichment to 20 percent (weaponization is 80 percent). They could also keep IAEA monitoring, which the Europeans seem to care for the most. This will certainly carry risks. The Europeans can reimpose sanctions of their own, but their companies have largely left anyway. America can impose new sanctions or threaten war, but is largely already doing in the context of what is now an obvious regime change campaign. As the saber rattling and frantic action imperative America once attached to Iran’s nuclear program shifts towards other topics, Iran will have to consider whether its full compliance with the JCPOA really mitigates these risks or merely delays them to its own disadvantage.

"Europe shifts its tone towards Iran","The European Union vehemently rejected an Iranian 60-day ultimatum to realize Europe’s so-called obligation to by-pass the U.S. sanctions that have crippled Tehran’s economy. In a written statement published in response to the Iranian ultimatum, the European Union highlighted that it “strongly urge(s) Iran to continue to implement its commitments under the JCPOA in full, as it has done until now, and to refrain from any escalatory steps,” while further emphasizing that the EU “reject(s) any ultimatums.” During an EU summit in the Romanian city of Sibiu, German Chancellor Angela Merkel reiterated the European Union’s position, that while it is keen on avoiding an escalation with the Islamic Republic, Tehran must recognize that it is in its own interests to remain committed to the deal . The German leader further highlighted the fact that while Europe hopes to preserve the nuclear deal, it does not agree with Iran on its foreign actions and aspirations, including its declared goal of annihilating Israel and its aggressive behavior across the Middle East. According to Merkel: “We do not want an escalation. We want to use further diplomatic means. We know our limits, but the more Europe is united — and this was the common position here — the better chances we have to implement chances and solutions through dialogue.” While the European Union evidently failed to broaden its so-called Special Purpose Vehicle that aims to by-pass the U.S. sanctions on Iran, limiting its function to the export of humanitarian goods; the Iranian decision to scale-back on its commitments to the nuclear agreement and pose an ultimatum on Europe has infuriated European officials who have warned that unless the Islamic republic reconsiders its position, there will be consequences. Jeremy Hunt, U.K. Foreign Secretary, said: “If they break that deal, then there will be consequences in terms of how European powers react. So we urge the Iranians to think very long and hard before they break that deal. It is in no one’s interest, it is certainly not in their interest because the moment they go nuclear, their neighbors will as well. And so that’s why this is a very serious moment, and we strongly urge them to reconsider what they said in their letter (ultimatum).” Meanwhile in Beijing , in the face of growing tension between China and the United States, the Beijing government has boldened its position vis-à-vis its economic, trade and energy cooperation with Iran, which it claims, ‘is conducted within the framework of international law.’ While Chinese companies have evidently sought to avoid doing business with the Islamic Republic for fear of U.S. penalties, the Chinese government is stepping up its efforts to convince Washington to avoid punishing its enterprises. Chinese Ministry of Commerce Spokesman Gao Feng said: “China and Iran are important economic and trade partners of each other. China resolutely opposes the United States imposing unilateral sanctions and the so-called long arm jurisdiction against Iran. Over a long period of time, the normal economic and trade and energy cooperation carried out by the international community, China included, with Iran within the framework of international law is reasonable and legal, which must be respected and protected. This is also a common stance taken by most members of the international community.” These was no official response to the Chinese statement, yet a senior White House official told TV7 that China is trying to use the situation with Iran as a bargaining chip for negotiations on other, more substantive dealings, with the United States. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, termed the Chinese statements as “hollow threats” that will not impact U.S. decision making on vital security considerations.

"The Emir and the Tsar: Kuwait Turns to Russia as Trump Clashes With Iran","Nicolai Due-Gundersen   As outlets discuss whether Iran’s Nuclear Deal is finished , a proximate Gulf state asserts its right to develop nuclear capacity. For Trump, such an assertion may be worrying. After all, Kuwait is considered a traditional US ally, yet amid American concerns of a nuclear Iran and squabbles with Putin , Kuwait is considering nuclear ambitions with Russian support.  As early as 2010, while Iran faced renewed UN sanctions for its nuclear progress, Kuwait and Russia signed an MoU to jointly develop Kuwait’s nuclear energy capacities, including through mutual uranium exploration . This MoU was expanded upon in 2017, when Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak boasted that Kuwait may construct a nuclear energy plant with Russian assistance . Both Kuwait and Russia are pragmatic on the world stage.  “Monarchy,” he insists, “was a legacy passed down from the Empire to Soviet times, even though the  plaque on the building changed.” Putin sums up such pragmatism best when discussing how Russian foreign relations are at the core of its political history. “Monarchy,” he insists, “was a legacy passed down from the Empire to Soviet times, even though the plaque on the building changed .” Putin himself is a product of Soviet pragmatism. As Russia’s Tsar will do business with Arab royals, so too will Kuwait assess its political options. Despite events thanking Bush Senior for his Gulf War leadership, Kuwait does not base its future on the past. The Gulf War is over and thanks to Trump’s fragmented foreign policies, Putin has won the Cold War . Trump’s declarations that Jerusalem and the Golan Heights are Israeli territory punctuate a US administration losing credibility in the Middle East, a fact that Russia is more than aware of.  Last month, Russia joined Turkey and Iran in condemning US recognition of the Golan . As the US considers withdrawal, Russia sees its opportunity to become a dominant and active power.  Trump’s declarations that Jerusalem and the Golan Heights are Israeli territory punctuate a US administration losing credibility in the Middle East, a fact that Russia is more than aware of. Kuwait-Russian relations began as early as the 19th Century, with Kuwait receiving military vessels of the Russian Empire. Kuwait was the first Arab monarchy to recognize the USSR. Putin’s overtures toward the small oil state are thus building on long-standing mutual history rather than solely regional tensions. And let’s not forget the mutual interest of energy. A 2015 MoU signed between Russia’s hydrocarbon giant Gazprom and the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation emphasized that relations between the two states are being cemented through energy and economic benefits. Ali Al-Ghanim, President of Kuwait’s Chamber of Commerce declared that deepening this partnership should result in mutual investment opportunities . However, energy access and geopolitics are a dominant theme in such mutual relations. “Russian-Gulf energy relations are significant because both parties have a common interest in monetizing the value of [oil and gas] in a world that increasingly privileges low-carbon energy,” explains Professor Li-Chen Sim of Zayed University (UAE). This is very true for the Gulf as a whole but Kuwait especially, which is struggling to emulate the Dubai framework of economic diversification through tourism and Western business models. Oil and gas are the only commodities. “Keeping the world supplied with fossil fuels extends the hydrocarbon age and its centrality to modern lifestyles,” continues Li-Chen Sim. Such dependence on hydrocarbons is how Gulf States lavish citizens with material rewards and prepare for a post-oil era. Russia, on the other hand, can combine the domestic peace oil prices can bring with Gulf investments in Russia’s declining oil fields. New fields must be developed to offset peaking ones, and it is with Gulf wealth that Putin plans to do it.  Kuwait-Russian relations began as early as the 19th Century, with Kuwait receiving military vessels of the Russian Empire. Kuwait was the first Arab monarchy to recognize the USSR. Putin’s overtures toward the small oil state are thus building on long-standing mutual history rather than solely regional tensions. For both Russia and Kuwait, their relations also have the impact of diversifying away from Western markets, including America. By 2016, Russia’s foreign energy investments into Asia saw it replace Saudi Arabia as China’s top crude oil supplier. Kuwait’s growing relations with Russia also connect with its Chinese relations. Kuwait’s trade agreements with its Asian counterpart are intended to strengthen Eurasian ties and Kuwait’s economic diversification without Western reliance. Kuwait is not alone, as the GCC is turning toward Asia rather than the US or Britain for oil trade and investment. “Asia has developed into the world’s centre for the manufacturing of exported goods,” argues energy analyst Walid Khadurri of The Arab Weekly. “The GCC is the world’s top region for energy export. Asia needs energy to fuel its manufacturing export industry and the GCC needs markets for its growing exports. The two regions’ goals complement each other.” As a smaller Gulf State, Kuwait can use its Russian relations to bolster access to China through a partner that has greater political clout, being active not only in the Middle East but a member of the Eurasian security forum The Shanghai Cooperation  Organization, of which Russia and China are the largest members.  “The GCC is the world’s top region for energy export. Asia needs energy to fuel its manufacturing export industry and the GCC needs markets for its growing exports. The two regions’ goals complement each other.” Ironically, the collapse of an Iranian Nuclear Deal may keep Kuwait’s oil prices high . With Russia itself under threat of sanctions , Putin was no doubt satisfied that Iran’s problems also gained Russia a spike in its own oil prices . If anything, Kuwait’s and Russia’s energy gains augment a partnership away from the West that can ride Iranian containment, GCC diversification and a history based on mutual interest.  Kuwait is balancing its US relations with Russian friendship during a period of tension in the region. However, a pragmatic Emir no doubt appreciates a pragmatic Tsar. As the US considers winding down Middle East intervention, Russia is willing to fill the vacuum. Kuwait and the whole Gulf is happy to welcome the change. © 2000 - 2019 Al Bawaba (www.albawaba.com)  View the discussion thread.

Every Monday With the end of the INF treaty this year and the New START treaty set to expire soon, Russians are anxious to establish a new arms control regime with the U.S. But they are still waiting for the Trump administration to make an offer. Loading...  May 21, 2019  Only a few months ago, many were declaring the half-century-old paradigm of U.S.-Russia nuclear arms control all but dead. But when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with Russian President Vladimir Putin last week, Mr. Pompeo said that “arms control” was on the agenda. Now Russians are wondering whether a new, bigger deal may be in the cards. Like many ideas put out by the Trump administration, the fresh talk of arms control might mean almost anything. Analysts say it might just be a distraction, to introduce an upbeat note into an agenda loaded with issues that Russia and the U.S. bitterly disagree about. But there might just be a new and bigger concept coming that Russia could be willing to discuss. “The Americans have signaled a willingness to talk about more general principles of strategic stability rather than counting missiles and warheads,” says Andrey Kortunov of the Russian International Affairs Council. “That would be issues like militarization of space, and artificial intelligence, and other things that might destabilize the situation. It’s not about reduction of arms, but reduction of risk.” It’s become something of a signature play by the Trump administration to reject or tear down an existing framework of agreements, then pledge to replace it with something much, much better. Russian security experts, who have attentively watched recent United States approaches to North Korea and Iran, among others, are wondering about Washington’s apparently newfound priority for “ arms control .” Is Russia about to be offered a whole new deal, in an area that is traditionally of huge importance to Moscow? It’s a bit of a head-scratcher because no details have been offered by either the White House or the Kremlin following President Vladimir Putin’s meeting in Sochi with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last week. And the return to talk of arms deals comes only a few months since many started declaring the half-century-old paradigm of U.S.-Russia nuclear arms control all but dead . Earlier this year the U.S. pulled out of the landmark Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty, which banned a whole class of nuclear missiles as the Cold War was ending, and Russia followed suit. No one thinks the agreement can be revived. The last remaining strategic arms accord, the New START treaty signed almost a decade ago , expires in less than two years, and no negotiations to extend it are yet on the horizon. Like many ideas put out by the Trump administration, the fresh talk of arms control might mean almost anything. Analysts say it might just be a distraction, to introduce an upbeat note into an agenda loaded with issues that Russia and the U.S. bitterly disagree about, like Iran and Venezuela . But there might just be a new and bigger concept coming out of Washington, one that Russia could be willing to discuss, some analysts say. “The Americans have signaled a willingness to talk about more general principles of strategic stability rather than counting missiles and warheads,” says Andrey Kortunov, director of the Russian International Affairs Council, which is affiliated with the Foreign Ministry. “That would be issues like militarization of space, and artificial intelligence, and other things that might destabilize the situation. It’s not about reduction of arms, but reduction of risk. We do believe that the U.S. needs arms control in some form; that there is a consensus that it strengthens national security can be verified with Russia, and serves to promote stability.” Mr. Kortunov says he had a chat with U.S. national security adviser John Bolton last year, at a breakfast meeting in the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, in which Mr. Bolton strongly suggested that the Trump administration wants to leave an imprint on nuclear arms control that would distinguish it from its predecessors.  “Bolton said that all these existing deals are too small and narrow, and that we need to come up with something big – a new principle of strategic stability,” Mr. Kortunov says. “One of the ambitions they might have is to do something that would put Trump in a whole different league from Obama. It’s not at all clear what that means for us. But would Russia be willing to talk about it? Probably. We’ve had a lot of disappointments with Trump in the past few years, and it’s a big question for us whether he can deliver anything he talks about. But maybe at least we could hope for some kind of confrontation management.” Both the U.S. and Russia are in the midst of sweeping modernization of their nuclear deterrent forces, and neither would probably be willing to cut their arsenals below the levels stipulated in the New START treaty , say experts. One complaint the U.S. has raised about the old framework of arms control is that it is bilateral and does not include new nuclear missile powers like China. Even though the U.S. and Russia still possess over 90 percent of all existing nuclear weapons, it’s a legitimate point, analysts say. “It may be possible to prolong the New START treaty, but do we really need it in its present bilateral form?” asks Pavel Zolotaryov, deputy director of the Institute for U.S. and Canada Studies in Moscow, which is part of the Russian Academy of Sciences. He says the old deterrence framework of mutual assured destruction still works, but it is fast being eroded by the emergence of new powers. The issue facing the U.S. and Russia now is how best to expand the arms control framework to include these new countries. “It doesn’t look likely that China and other countries will agree to join the process now, but the sooner the U.S. and Russia prolong the treaty we have, the sooner we can move on to finding ways to bring in others,” Mr. Zolotaryov says. “It’s becoming urgent to solve these new questions about nuclear deterrence, to minimize the risk that nuclear weapons will be used.” Fyodor Lukyanov, editor of Russia in Global Affairs, a leading Moscow-based foreign policy journal, says that more than two years of dealing with the mercurial and contradictory style of the Trump administration have left Russia’s foreign policy community bemused and divided over whether to try to deal with it, or just wait it out.

Others say there is nothing we can get from the U.S. at this point, so why bother? The only practical thing we really have to talk about is extending New START. That would be a cheap and easy way to create the impression of activity,” he says. “But it’s a strange picture. Despite the fact that our relations over the past three years have been a disaster, there are many people who hear Trump saying positive things [about relations with Russia] and seeming to resist the people who embody the old approaches, and it makes him look good to some Russian commentators. Apparently that includes Putin. In spite of everything, there is this feeling that Trump is different, that he is the guy to tear down this post-Cold War system,” he says. “So, if he invites Russia to dance one more time, we will probably be willing to dance with him.” Link copied.

"The Hidden Sources of Iranian Strength","Argument:  The Hidden Sources of Iranian Strength  The Hidden Sources of Iranian Strength...  “What Americans don’t understand is that the groups that we support in the region are not our mercenaries,” Ali, a high-ranking member of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), said when I recently asked him about one of the stated goals of the Trump administration’s sanctions against Iran: to curtail the country’s ability to financially support militias in the region. He continued, “The Americans think everything is about money. They think we buy loyalty in the region, because that’s how they buy loyalty.” In the decade that I did research with cultural producers in Iran’s preeminent military force, the IRGC, I saw a steady flow of filmmakers loyal to Hezbollah and Iraqi Shiite and Kurdish groups travel through regime cultural centers in Tehran. (They all agreed to speak with me on the condition of anonymity. The first names used here are pseudonyms.) Mehdi, an Iranian pro-regime filmmaker, had lived in Lebanon to make films with Hezbollah media producers. When they visited him in Tehran, they spoke fluent Persian and navigated the city with familiar ease. Iraqi filmmakers would regularly come to spend time in Tehran at editing studios tied to the paramilitary Basij organization. Although my research focused on cultural producers, I saw a similar flow of foreigners in the economic and military arms of the IRGC. The flow of goods, ideas, and people between Iran and its proxies is certain to continue amid President Donald Trump’s sanctions, facilitated by a spectrum of institutions that do not rely on heavy financial investments and by enduring friendships on all sides. Historically, the connections between Iran, Iraq, and the Levant go back generations. Long-standing trade and pilgrimage routes, as well as a constellation of religious seminaries, meant that communities and entire families seamlessly traveled, lived, conversed, and created cultural and social ties. The mere existence of these ties, however, does not translate into politically active groups. Policymakers and the public misunderstand the nature of these ties, explaining them as ones bound by Shiism as a traditional, religious doctrine. This misunderstanding arises from a fundamentally flawed framework that undergirds Washington’s entire Iran and Middle East policy—a belief that what drove the 1979 revolution in Iran was a fanatical quest for Islamic politics. But what actually binds these groups together is not an adherence to specific theological doctrine—if that were the case, Iran would not have close relationships with certain Palestinian factions, nor with Iraqi Kurdish groups, to say nothing of ties to Bashar al-Assad in Syria or the Houthis in Yemen. In order to understand how a political quest for sovereignty, rather than an otherworldly quest for religious rule, animates Iran’s relations with its proxies, it is first necessary to unpack current assumptions about the revolution that led to the Islamic Republic. In a newly emerging generation of scholarship aimed at constructing a social history of the revolution, research shows that what motivated Iranians to support the revolution en masse was a desire to rid the country of imperialism. As a prominent historian of Iran, Ervand Abrahamian has argued that the 1979 revolution should be seen as a continuation of the national struggle for liberation that was cut short in 1953 by a U.S.-orchestrated coup. In a first for the CIA, the United States deposed democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadeq, reinstated Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, and took control of Iran’s oil fields. Domestically, no matter what the shah did in that 26-year interim between 1953 and 1979, the coup cast its long shadow over his rule. His perceived illegitimacy was tied to the sentiment that he did the bidding of the Americans and Brits and sold out his country’s national integrity for power and wealth. As the historian Naghmeh Sohrabi argues , the 1979 revolution in Iran should be understood “as one of the last great successful revolutions of the post-colonial world and in its post-revolutionary shape, as one of the first to answer the questions and anxieties of its global south ethos in an Islamic form.” Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, with his drab clerical garb and non-Tehrani-accented Persian, was the symbolic opposite of the opulent wealth of the shah. Khomeini’s populist message to restore justice and integrity to Iran in the face of international and domestic humiliation resonated with a population that, despite the great oil wealth of the 1970s, remained largely poor and rural. A massive popular revolution from below drove out the shah not just because of economic, cultural, or political shortcomings (those existed in other countries too but did not result in a revolutionary movement) but rather because revolutionaries cast the shah as an American puppet who did not have the best interests of the nation in mind. The core issues of the revolution were sovereignty and independence from outside powers. Now, what does this have to do with Iran’s relationship with its proxies? In the 40 years since the revolution, the Islamic Republic has supported groups that are actively engaged in struggles against foreign occupation, whether in Lebanon, Iraq, or the occupied Palestinian territories. (This analysis also drove its policies in Syria, where it believed the United States, Europe, and Israel were using domestic groups, and later mercenaries, to topple Assad for geopolitical purposes.) When one pays close attention to the discourse of these groups, from their official statements to their media output, the emphasis is on sovereignty and the fight against imperialism. Of course the symbolism of Islam as a cultural and political identity is also present, but it is not the driving force. “The Americans think we’re crazed Muslims on a path of martyrdom and that Iraqis and Lebanese have this same crazed mentality,” said Hossein, an IRGC commander during the Iran-Iraq War and now a media producer. “They don’t want to think that we have legitimate political concerns that are about a region free from imperial domination and a quest to control our resources.” Mehdi, the Iranian filmmaker who has spent years living and working in Lebanon with Hezbollah media producers, said, “I joined the revolutionary forces because I wanted to be like Dr. Chamran. What he did for the Lebanese and Palestinians, and later for Iran, that’s what drove so many of us.” Mehdi referred to one of the main early strategists of the revolutionary armed forces of Iran, as well as the first defense minister of the revolutionary government, Mostafa Chamran. A University of California, Berkeley-educated physicist who was deeply involved in the anti-colonial movements of the 1960s and 1970s, Chamran trained in guerrilla tactics in Cuba and Egypt and worked in Lebanon to organize Shiites in the 1970s. Mehdi and his Lebanese collaborators have created films about Chamran and big public education programs to teach their younger generations about this military leader. The military tactics of the 1970s anti-colonial movements were built into the DNA of the IRGC and, by extension, into the DNA of militias Iran backs in the region. These asymmetrical warfare tactics were tested in battle over an eight-year period during the Iran-Iraq War. From 1980 to 1988, the IRGC learned how to fight, create military strategy, and withstand a superior military force funded and supplied by the West. Like many anti-colonial movements of that time, the Iranian revolution did not lead to liberation but a bloody struggle for power that eventually suppressed dissenting voices. In the four decades since its establishment, the Islamic Republic and the IRGC have practiced heavy-handed politics that have resulted in deep wounds that will not be easily forgiven. Yet among supporters of the Islamic Republic, both internally and externally, the Iranian post-revolutionary government remains legitimate and a cause worth fighting alongside precisely because it has been able to thwart U.S. aggression in Iraq and Afghanistan; because it fought against the Islamic State, largely leading to its defeat; and because its support of Hezbollah has helped keep Israel out of Lebanon. Since the Trump administration has come to power, U.S. foreign policy has reverted back to strong-arm politics that seek to bully those who will not fall in line. In the Middle East, it is not just Iran that the United States has gone after. In light of the recent annexation of the Golan Heights and the granting of drilling rights to a company linked to Dick Cheney , as well as wider support of Benjamin Netanyahu’s expansionist policies in the occupied Palestinian territories, the wider desire among the American and Israeli right to control, and profit off of, natural resources in the Middle East is not lost on any of these groups, especially Hezbollah, but also various Iraqi groups that are concerned about control over their oil fields. For its supporters, Iran’s current predicament in the face of a U.S. administration that demands the country’s submission—even though it held up its end of the bargain—rhymes too perfectly with historical precedent to ignore. Domestically, despite widespread frustration with the regime, the quest for nuclear energy has been cast as a national right in Iran for decades. In my research, I have traced how the IRGC has cultivated a nationalist message in all of its cultural and media programming since at least 2005. Given the Trump administration’s actions against Iranians, from the so-called Muslim ban to withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal to designating the IRGC a foreign terrorist organization—effecting millions of young men who have served their mandatory military service under the IRGC—the Islamic Republic does not need to work too hard to make a case for national unity under these circumstances. Instead, the biggest outcome will be a militarized domestic sphere that will suppress dissenting voices even more in the face of an outside aggressor. In the past months since the devastating floods that hit nearly all corners of Iran, Iraqi, Afghan, and Lebanese filmmakers tied to the various militia groups in the region have been in Iran making news pieces and documentaries about the work of the IRGC and Iranian paramilitary groups in flooding assistance. This media output has been framed as a need for solidarity across the region with Iran as it faces natural disasters and the Trump administration. Throughout the region, even in societies at odds with Iran, these groups have successfully cast the suffering of Yemenis as an issue the Saudis have perpetuated. The media arms of these groups, which disseminate material in Arabic and Kurdish (in a variety of local dialects), do not have the massive budget of Saudi or Emirati media operations in the region. Yet, just like their military tactics on the ground, these groups have created an effective asymmetrical communications operation. U.S. officials may hope that sanctions will curtail Iran’s ability to fund these groups, but in their hope, they reveal their naiveté about two areas: First, through indigenous funding networks like khums and other kinds of tithes, money will continue to flow to these groups through a complex system of hawalas that will be hard for the U.S. Treasury Department to track; and second, the desire to rid the region of a foreign imperial power is a cause that has galvanized populations in the Middle East for generations. Money is not the main defining factor of such a cause. Narges Bajoghli is an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University’s School of Advanced International Studies.

Taking pages from the Iraq War playbook, senior officials paint a picture of a rogue, outlaw, terrorist regime bent on acquiring nuclear weapons and whose “malign activities” are the cause of all the chaos in the Middle East. They know what they are doing. They have done it before. They are building a case for war. The “maximum pressure” campaign by the White House, Treasury Department, and State Department accelerated this week with the announcement that the United States would force China, India, Japan, South Korea, and Turkey to cease all imports of Iranian oil or face severe U.S. sanctions. The goal is to cut to zero all of Iran’s oil exports, which account for some 40 percent of its national income. This strategy is unlikely to force the capitulation or collapse of the regime, but it very likely could lead to war. The United States has already reimposed all the nuclear-related sanctions lifted by the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that successfully rolled back and effectively froze Iran’s nuclear program and put it under the most stringent inspections ever negotiated. The goals of the sanctions announced April 22, however, go way beyond nuclear issues. “We have made our demands very clear to the ayatollah and his cronies,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in remarks to the press Monday morning. “End your pursuit of nuclear weapons. Stop testing and proliferating ballistic missiles. Stop sponsoring and committing terrorism. Halt the arbitrary detention of U.S. citizens.” All are worthy policy goals. The first, of course, has been met. The National Intelligence Estimate on Iran concluded that Iran ended its nuclear weapons program in 2003. There is no evidence that the program has restarted. Instead, in true Trumpian fashion, the administration simply asserts the counterfactual. It claims that the program has restarted, with slippery phrases about seeking weapons or  references to long-ended activities. The media, overloaded with the Mueller report and a daily cascade of lies, does not challenge these claims. It is no accident that National Security Advisor John Bolton, the man who declared  unequivocally in November 2002, “We are confident that Saddam Hussein has hidden weapons of mass destruction and production facilities in Iraq,” is now the chief strategist behind the drive towards war—with Mike Pompeo happily riding shotgun. Both are manipulating a distracted and largely uninformed president into a confrontation he may not actually want. Although Trump came into office promising to cancel the JCPOA painstakingly negotiated by the Obama administration and our allies, he was initially held in check by the united front of his military, intelligence, and diplomatic advisors. Then, Trump ousted Rex Tillerson and replaced him with Mike Pompeo. He fired H.R. McMaster and appointed John Bolton. He accepted the resignation of Jim Mattis as secretary of defense and replaced him with a former Boeing executive more interested in contracts than policy. Bolton has had a clear field ever since. With minimal or no inter-agency discussion, Bolton quickly dispensed with the Iran accord, but he did not stop there. By Christmas 2018, Bolton had dismantled what remained of U.S.-Iran relations. The United States reinstated all sanctions on Iran that were previously lifted by the Iran accord, and the State Department pulled out of the 1955 Treaty of Amity between the United States and Iran, which provided a “legal framework for bilateral relations.” As a result, Iran’s currency hit a historic low and the country witnessed waves of economic protests. Bolton used his national platform to publicly send bellicose warnings to the regime with statements like, “If you cross us, our allies, or our partners…there will indeed be hell to pay.” The “maximum pressure” campaign escalated in 2019. When terrorists attacked the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC)—an official branch of Iran’s military—killing 27 and wounding 13, the State Department offered no condolences. When widespread flooding devastated Iranian cities and infrastructure, claiming 60 lives in one week, the United States faulted the regime for the “mismanagement that has led to this disaster.” The campaign hit a crescendo on April 8, 2019—exactly one year to the day after Bolton’s appointment—with the unprecedented move of designating the IRGC a “Foreign Terrorist Organization.” It now appears alongside the Islamic State, al-Qaeda, and Boko Haram on this list. That day Pompeo delivered a statement to the press and public in which the words “terror,” “terrorism,” and “terrorist” appeared 21 times. This designation brings at least the IRGC and perhaps the entire nation within arm’s reach of the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force, legislation originally written to provide a legal basis for the invasion of Afghanistan in the wake of 9/11. The 2001 AUMF gives the president wide scope for the unilateral use of force against any parties or individuals associated with the 9/11 attacks, a point not lost on Pompeo. For over a year, the Trump administration, and Pompeo in particular, has been exaggerating the connection between Iran and al-Qaeda to claim legal justification for military action against Iran under the 2001 AUMF. In 2017, the CIA released additional records from the bin Laden files, ostensibly “to enhance public understanding of al-Qaeda.” Wrote former CIA analyst Ned Price: Bolton, Pompeo, and their allies in and out of government continued to hype the Iran-al-Qaeda link. In May 2018, announcing the U.S. abrogation of the nuclear agreement, Trump made a point of saying that “Iran supports terrorist proxies and militias such as…al-Qaeda.” In a speech at the Heritage Foundation later that month, Pompeo said : “Today we ask the Iranian people: Is this what you want your country to be known for, for being a co-conspirator with Hezbollah, Hamas, the Taliban, and al-Qaeda?” Experts have disparaged the administration’s claims, noting the longstanding hostility between Iran, a Shia-majority nation, and the radical Sunni group. A definitive New America study published in late 2018 found no evidence that Iran and al-Qaeda collaborated in carrying out terrorist attacks. That hasn’t stopped the administration from continuing the insinuations. In testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Pompeo went out of his way to construct explicit connections between al-Qaeda and the IRGC with multiple statements like: “there is no doubt there is a connection between the Islamic Republic of Iran and Al-Qaeda. Period, full stop.” Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) zeroed in to the subtext of Pompeo’s repetitive al-Qaeda-Iran connections. If the administration determines a valid link between al-Qaeda and the Iranian government, it may be able to declare war on Iran by using the 2001 AUMF, bypassing Congress entirely. So, Senator Paul pressed Pompeo on that point, asking him if he believes that the 2001 AUMF applies to Iran or Iran’s Revolutionary Guard. Pompeo dodged the question: “I would prefer to leave that to the lawyers, Senator.” Neither Bolton nor Pompeo has yet provided a clear answer. The administration’s plan is clear: keep beating the twin drums of terrorism and nuclear threat. Bolton and Pompeo will use both to justify more sanctions and more provocations. They have a highly disciplined, coordinated messaging strategy. They establish the following false claim, as Bolton did this January in a conversation with Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel: “Despite getting out of the Iran nuclear deal, despite the sanctions, we have little doubt that Iran’s leadership is still strategically committed to achieving deliverable nuclear weapons.” The claims are then echoed , as this one was in a Twitter video a few weeks later. And again by U.S. Special Representative for Iran Brian Hook, in a New York Times op-ed, demanding that Iran “behave like a normal, peaceful nation: end the pursuit of nuclear weapons, stop testing ballistic missiles, stop sponsoring terrorist proxies.” And again this week by Pompeo, in announcing the oil sanctions, when he demanded that Iran “end [its] pursuit of nuclear weapons.” It does not matter that U.S. intelligence assessments—as well as Israeli intelligence and the International Atomic Energy Agency— confirm that Iran is complying with the JCPOA. Or that Saudi Arabia has likely funded al-Qaeda and other Sunni terrorist groups. Or that the US invasion of Iraq is the principle cause of Middle East chaos today. Trump officials will cherry-pick information, package it, and amplify it across a willing echo chamber—exactly as the Bush administration did in the lead up to the Iraq war. The real question is whether America will fall for it again. Articles by guest writers. Maybe a word or two about the inhumane Ayatollahs, or do you think they are just great for Iran? I’m afraid that the Americans have had lost control of their own government since Ronald Reagan’s time! Since then the government’s have been committing crimes against humanity with NO consequences for their actions! US is forcing Iran into war. They just declared they will close Straits of Hormuz if the US succeeds in sanctioning Iranian oil sales. This has potential to escalate quickly. I am someone who has lived in Beirut, Baghdad, Riyadh and Abu Dhabi. I have experienced wars dating back to 1975. The present is disappointingly like the past, with likely (un)predictable results. Plus ca change… In regards to Russia Trump has Trumped and silenced Pimpeo and Bolton. The trio also has realized that the Trade War with China hasn’t worked since President Xi turned the table on them and changed the argument to a tit for tat war and eventually the trio backed off. Also the negotiations with Kim Jong-Un are dead since KJU distrusted and rejected Pompeo. Additionally Trump is spending much of his time with his own problems domestically and spending the rest of his time on his own golf courses instead of governing the country. So the trio is really bored to death and have nothing to do in their offices! So they are ganging up on Iran or the weakest link as a gang of bullies. “The National Intelligence Estimate on Iran concluded that Iran ended its nuclear weapons program in 2003. There is no evidence that the program has restarted” Actually there was never any evidence that a nuclear weapons program existed even before 2003 – “The U.N. nuclear agency has no proof that Iran HAS OR ONCE HAD a covert atomic bomb program, it said on Thursday, dismissing a report that it had concluded Iran was on its way to producing nuclear weapons…”  reuters.com/article/us-nuclear-iaea-iran-sb/iaea-denies-report-it-is-sure-iran-seeking-atom-bomb-idUSTRE58G60W20090917 And furthermore, Iran had long been making BETTER compromise offers over its nuclear program than the JCPOA; offers that were ignored or even deliberately undermined in order to maintain the “nuclear threat” pretext for regime change. “In 2005, Iran offered a deal.  We rejected it, refused to talk to Iran directly, and doubled down on sanctions.  Ten years later, we settled for much less than what was originally offered.” chasfreeman.net/lessons-from-americas-continuing-misadventures-in-the-middle-east/ This happened over and over again opendemocracy.net/en/us-scuppered-deal-with-iran-in-2005-says-then-british-foreign-minister/ opendemocracy.net/en/us-scuppered-deal-with-iran-in-2005-says-then-british-foreign-minister/ nytimes.com/2006/04/05/opinion/we-in-iran-dont-need-this-quarrel.html Comments are closed.

"Iran’s Revolutionary Guards reject talks with US after Trump appeal","Iranian demonstrators burn a US flag during a rally in Tehran to show their support of Iran’s decision to pull out from some part of nuclear deal. Photograph: Abedin Taherkenareh/EPA Iran’s Revolutionary Guards said on Friday that Tehran would not negotiate with the United States and a senior cleric warned that a US navy fleet could be “destroyed with one missile”, as a US aircraft carrier headed towards the Gulf. The comments by the Guards and by Ayatollah Yousef Tabatabai-Nejad, a hardliner, appeared partly aimed at discouraging President Hassan Rouhani and his moderate allies in Tehran from taking up an offer of talks from Washington. US president Donald Trump on Thursday urged Iran’s leadership to sit down and talk with him about giving up their nuclear programme and said he could not rule out a military confrontation given the heightened tensions. The carrier Abraham Lincoln, deployed by the Trump administration to the Middle East as a warning to Iran , passed through Egypt’s Suez Canal on Thursday. American B-52 bombers have also arrived at a US base in Qatar , US Central Command said. Iran has dismissed the dispatch of both the bombers and the aircraft carrier as “psychological warfare” designed to intimidate it. The semi-official ISNA news agency, reporting from the central Iranian city of Isfahan, quoted Ayatollah Tabatabai-Nejad as saying: “Their billion [-dollar] fleet can be destroyed with one missile.” “If they attempt any move, they will . . . [face] dozens of missiles because at that time [government] officials won’t be in charge to act cautiously, but instead things will be in the hands of our beloved leader [Ayatollah Ali Khamenei],” he said. Tabatabai-Nejad is the representative in Isfahan of supreme leader Khamenei, who is widely seen to be close to hardliners who oppose Mr Rouhani and his moderate allies. Separately, Yadollah Javani, the elite Revolutionary Guards’ deputy head for political affairs, said: “No talks will be held with the Americans, and the Americans will not dare take military action against us.” “Our nation . . . sees America as unreliable,” said Mr Javani , according to the semi-official Tasnim news agency. Thousands of Iranians took part in state-sponsored marches on Friday to show support for the government’s decision to scale back curbs on its nuclear programme agreed under a 2015 deal with world powers. Iran has threatened to do more if signatories do not shield it from US economic sanctions. State television showed the protesters marching after Friday prayers in Tehran and said similar marches were held across the country. “America should know, sanctions have no effect!” chanted the protesters, many of whom carried signs reading “Down with USA”. Mr Trump, who last year pulled Washington out of the Iran nuclear deal and reimposed sanctions on Tehran, has expressed a willingness to meet Iranian leaders in the past to no avail and renewed that appeal in talking to reporters on Thursday. Asked about Mr Trump’s comments, Iran’s ambassador to the United Nations , Majid Takht Ravanchi , said Tehran had been talking with the six powers, including the United States, within the framework of the nuclear deal. “All of a sudden he [Trump] decided to leave the negotiating table . . . What is the guarantee that he will not renege again?” Takht Ravanchi said in a US television interview. He dismissed US allegations of an Iranian threat as “fake intelligence” and said they were “being produced by the same people” who did so in the run-up to the US invasion of Iraq in 2003. US officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said one of the pieces of intelligence which caused US concerns, indicated Iran had moved missiles on boats. One of the officials said the particular missile observed was perhaps capable of being launched from a small ship. – Reuters Subscribe.

""Fatal flaws" remain in British PM's new Brexit deal: DUP","BELFAST (Reuters) - The "fatal flaws" of the draft Brexit treaty agreed with the European Union remain despite British Prime Minister Theresa May seeking to set out a new deal on Tuesday, the Northern Irish party propping up her government said. "We will have to await the publication of the text of the bill to see what the proposals actually mean but the fact is that the fatal flaws of the draft treaty remain," the Democratic Unionist Party's (DUP) deputy leader Nigel Dodds said in a statement after May's speech.

"","The Caribbean Community (Caricom) was, on the face of it, unanimous in its rejection last week of Donald Trump’s rekindling of the contumelious Helms-Burton Act that allows Americans to sue foreigners who possess ­former US-owned properties in Cuba, nationalised after Cuba’s 1959 revolution. Just as significant was Caricom’s repudiation of America’s long-­standing economic embargo against Cuba. While few doubt the sincerity of the empathy with Cuba, many in the region question the strength, and sustainability, of the unity behind it. They see a clear nexus between Washington’s deepening hostility towards its old ideological foe, Havana, and its posture towards Nicolás Maduro’s Venezuela, over which Caricom is fractured. Caricom declared its stance against foreign military intervention in Venezuela. Officially, the group supports internal dialogue to solve the country’s political crisis. But four of its members, including Jamaica, sided with the United States (US) in deeming Mr Maduro’s presidency illegitimate. These countries, largely tugged along by America, have all but endorsed the National Assembly’s head, Juan Guaidó, as the self-declared acting president, despite their contortions to provide themselves with plausible deniability. America’s stance towards Cuba and Venezuela should be a matter of serious concern for Caribbean governments, for the deeper instability it could foment and the unintended consequences these might generate. However, neither Havana nor Caracas represent the full extent of the danger this region could face. For the nexus between these two countries extends to Iran, and is being dragged by Mr Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton. Mr Bolton was among the neoconservatives who were in the ascendancy in Washington during George W Bush’s presidency. He subscribes to an American foreign-policy position that projects, and uses, hard power, including removing ideological adversaries, especially if they are relatively weak. He was one of the architects of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Mr Bolton has found compatibility with Donald Trump, but not in the way that their relationship is often portrayed by the pundits on the American left – of the hawking ideologue (Mr Bolton) finding an empty suit (Mr Trump) capable of being stiffened into an animated puppet. Their partnership is likely to be far more complex, which doesn’t make it less dangerous. Mr Trump is driven by his obvious need to undo anything, especially if presumed to be good, achieved by his predecessor, Barack Obama – the Paris ­climate deal, the Affordable Care Act, the Iran nuclear deal, and, in our neighbourhood, efforts to normalise US-Cuba relations after decades of ideological chill. In Mr Bolton, President Trump found the strongman persona, to which he so instinctually gravitates, who possessed the ideological hawkishness that lends intellectual credence to unsubstantial ideas. Mr Trump knows he has the power to, at anytime, pull the plug on Mr Bolton. It is unlikely that the national security adviser, whatever may be the claim, will publicly espouse or implement policies with which his boss disagrees, or hasn’t endorsed. Mr Trump is likely to presume that he has the option of going to the brink, and, if necessary, pulling back. Things can go wrong, however, in the absence of rigorous policy and when leaders operate without underlying moral or philosophical framework, and perceive wars more like animated parlour games rather than nasty encounters of blood and gore. Against that backdrop, and America’s build-up in the Middle East, mistakes are possible. America could stumble into a war with Iran, made easier by the atmosphere developed over Venezuela, which some Caribbean nations facilitated. Or, if international realities make Iran too difficult, Venezuela could well be a viable fall-back option. In any circumstances, Caricom members will face collateral damage, at the very least, of instability in our region. The situation calls for a serious assessment of ­foreign-policy planning and goals by Caribbean ­governments, leading to, in so far as practicable, a ­common Caricom foreign policy. Jamaica should start establishing a commission of retired foreign-ministry mandarins to help refocus our foreign-policy agenda and to again be grounded at that centre which served us well, which we appear to have lost in recent years. — Courtesy Jamaica Gleaner The Caribbean Community (Caricom) was, on the face of it, unanimous in its rejection last week of Donald Trump’s rekindling of the contumelious Helms-Burton Act that allows Americans to sue foreigners who possess ­former US-owned properties in Cuba, nationalised after Cuba’s 1959 revolution. WITHIN one week, the High Court made two rulings on malicious prosecution of citizens by police officers that cannot be ignored by the Police Service Commission (PSC) and the Trinidad and Tobago Police Service (TTPS). We have done a great job aggregating Government services into the modern facility known as the Government Campus. Along with that infrastructure modernisation, equally important is moderni­sing systems of operation and the mindsets of people. Can we please accelerate a collaboration with Estonia, a digital leader in Europe of electronic government services? Readers might wonder why they should be concerned about who is the chief executive officer of any multilateral or international organisation. It could be claimed that the disposition of the person holding such an office is far removed from the existence of people who are focused on the necessities of living and improving their lives. They would be wrong. A recent report by the British organisation, the Royal Society for the Arts, Manufacturers and Commerce, has recommended a basic pay of 2,400 pounds sterling, as a means of eradicating poverty in the UK. Attorney General Faris Al-Rawi has been both an embar­rassment and a liability to the Keith Rowley-led PNM (People’s National Movement). The latest ruling of the Privy Council and the comments of the law lords seem to be the proverbial nail in the coffin for the hapless Al-Rawi.

"Germany’s Trade With Iran Slumps Amid U.S. Sanctions","Published on By Trade between Germany and Iran declined steeply in the first months of this year, data from the Association of German Chambers of Commerce and Industry revealed on Friday. According to the figures, reported by the German Funke media group, exports from Europe’s largest economy to the populous Middle Eastern power plummeted by 52.6 per cent year-on-year to 233 million Euros (261 million dollars) in January and February. It said that imports from Iran dropped by 42.2 per cent to 41 million Euros. “The market in Iran is extremely difficult because of the U.S. sanctions and because of the country’s economic framework,’’ the head of the German-Iranian chamber of commerce, Dagmar von Bohnstein, said. This week, Iranian President Hassan Rowhani threatened to gradually pull out of the nuclear deal with world powers because of crippling U.S. oil and banking sanctions that are hampering the Islamic Republic’s efforts to break out of its economic isolation. One year ago, U.S. President Donald Trump announced Washington’s exit from the 2015 pact, which has curbed Iran’s nuclear activities as a way of preventing nuclear armament. The lifting of sanctions against Iran was a key element of the pact, but the U.S. has reimposed some punitive measures over the past year.

Amash, the libertarian-leaning lawmaker, doubled down on his weekend claim that the president engaged in impeachable conduct and has since been the center of speculation about a possible 2020 challenge to the president on the Libertarian Party ticket.  As Jonathan Easley reported , buzz is building that Amash will leave the Republican Party to launch a bid. Earlier this year, Amash left the door open to a Libertarian Party run and he has repeatedly expressed frustration with the GOP for abandoning its conservative principles to bend for Trump.  His statement over the weekend that he believed Trump committed impeachable offenses energized and united the “Never Trump” Republicans, who have been unable to recruit a candidate of their own, and prominent libertarians.  Since those remarks, Trump and his top allies have gone on the attack on his behalf. Additionally, GOP leaders are poo-pooing the idea that Amash could be a spoiler for the president, particularly in Michigan, which the president won in 2016 by just north of 10,000 votes ( The Hill ).  McCarthy , who left the door open to supporting a challenger if Amash runs for his House seat again, downplayed impact Amash may have on the 2020 scene and questioned whether anyone there has even heard of him before this past weekend.  “How many people know Justin Amash? ” McCarthy asked reporters. “ The only people I saw come up and congratulate him [tonight] were Democrats.

WHITE HOUSE & ADMINISTRATION: Former White House Counsel Don McGahn will not appear on Capitol Hill on Tuesday and plans to “respect the president’s instruction” to defy a congressional subpoena, setting off a new round of calls to get the ball rolling on impeachment proceedings against the president.

"Trying to Kill the Iran Deal Could End Up Saving It","Trump administration officials are publicly united on their policy of punishing the Islamic Republic. But cracks are showing over just how far to go. The Trump administration has made a priority of punishing and pressuring Iran. But the same administration that withdrew from the nuclear deal that President Donald Trump dubbed “a great embarrassment” may actually end up preserving it. Iran and all the other signatories are still observing the deal’s terms for now. The U.S. reimposed sanctions on the Islamic Republic last fall, driving down its oil exports and further stressing its weak economy. But even as the administration pursues what it calls a “maximum pressure” campaign against the country, it has also made exceptions through sanctions waivers that have helped keep Iranian oil flowing and even preserved some international nuclear cooperation with the country. Now, ahead of a key deadline in May, the administration is sending conflicting signals about just how far it plans to go to confront the regime. At issue, in part, is the stated intent to choke off Iran’s oil exports entirely and throttle its oil-dependent economy. Following through could mean fights with allies that import Iranian oil, or even a higher risk that Iran ditches the deal altogether and starts racing to a nuclear weapon. Backing off the promise could leave the deal limping along for a potential new president to reenter it, as the Democratic Party has called for . While Trump-administration officials are all singing from the same hawkish hymnal about the march to zero exports, cracks are beginning to show. State Department officials say they are not “looking to grant” new waivers when the current round expires around May 4, but won’t comment on renewing existing ones; they hedge about getting to zero “as soon as possible” and the need to avoid disrupting oil markets. Representatives from the Department of Energy and the National Security Council (NSC) have meanwhile pointed to data showing that oil markets are well supplied enough to keep prices stable, even with the loss of Iranian crude. “We’re not very worried about it,” a Department of Energy spokesperson told me. “We think the market will balance itself out.” Hawks in Congress seem to agree. “If our policy objective is zero, our policy should be doing its damnedest to get to zero,” one Republican congressional staffer familiar with the interagency discussions told me. “My sense is we’re not. There is hedging.” This person and another source familiar with the discussions said the disconnect is fueling an interagency argument between members of the State Department and the NSC as the deadline approaches. Asked for comment on the purported disagreement, a spokesperson for the NSC said, “The National Security Council coordinates closely across the interagency to apply maximum economic pressure against Iran.” A State Department spokesman also did not comment directly on the interagency disconnect, but offered a statement from Brian Hook, the U.S. special representative for Iran, reiterating the policy to get to zero and noting that “we have already achieved significant reductions in Iran’s exports.” There’s public unity, at any rate, about forcing change in Iran. Trump has directly threatened Iranian President Hassan Rouhani via tweet, vowing “CONSEQUENCES THE LIKES OF WHICH FEW THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAVE EVER SUFFERED BEFORE” should Rouhani threaten the United States. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has vowed “unprecedented financial pressure on the Iranian regime.” National Security Adviser John Bolton has dubbed Iran the “central banker of terrorism” and noted, “That’s not behavior we should tolerate.” Hook said in his statement to The Atlantic that sanctions on Iran are “draining their resources to fund terrorism.” Yet there’s also discord beneath the surface. Hook spent months negotiating with the Europeans to preserve a version of a deal that Trump would accept, only to have the president announce his withdrawal last May. At a recent conference in Warsaw, Vice President Mike Pence publicly demanded that the Europeans leave the deal, reportedly infuriating Pompeo, who has made no such demands. Hook has consistently reiterated the zero-exports goal, but he also told a conference this week that Trump “doesn’t want to shock oil markets,” even as he acknowledged market surpluses. In a sign of the interagency disconnect, Richard Goldberg, director for countering Iranian weapons of mass destruction at the NSC, said, “The oil market is well supplied and can absorb the loss of Iranian crude,” speaking at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies last month. Projections from the Energy Information Administration released this week show the same thing , even accounting for losses of Venezuelan oil exports due to additional U.S. sanctions. Trump’s exit from the Iran deal last year came with some caveats. The basic framework of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), as the pact is formally known, was an exchange of economic incentives, including a suspension of past sanctions, for Iranian nuclear restraint. Ahead of reimposing sanctions on Iranian oil exports, though, Trump gave Iran’s trading partners about six months to make other arrangements, and bargained with Saudi Arabia to increase oil production to keep prices stable. But the idea was that any country still importing Iranian oil by that November would be sanctioned. Iran’s exports began declining even before then, as countries fled the possibility of financial punishment. And even as Trump worried about prices, Energy Secretary Rick Perry was sanguine about the issue on the op-ed page of The Wall Street Journal : “The U.S. Energy Information Administration expects global oil supply to meet demand in 2019 even without Iranian oil.” So it was a surprise that the deadline came and Trump handed out some sanctions exceptions, including to China, Taiwan, India, and South Korea, granting them access to Iranian oil for another six months without penalty. The markets didn’t see it coming; oversupply resulted; prices dropped . Over the period since Trump announced he was leaving the Iran deal, though, Iran’s oil exports have fallen by more than half, from more than 2.5 million barrels per day to about a million barrels per day. But neither Hook nor Pompeo will specify over what time period they hope to get to zero. Asked at an energy conference this week whether it was even possible to get there, Pompeo would only say, “I’m not going to get ahead of myself or ahead of the president, but make no mistake about it, that’s the direction of travel.” Meanwhile, Reuters has reported that the United States is leaving the door open for waivers, even if at a reduced number. Japanese and South Korean officials have stated publicly that they’re seeking them; outside analysts have also suggested that China is a likely candidate, given how much Iranian oil it currently imports and its ongoing trade negotiations with the United States. Sources in India have told reporters that that country, too, is engaged in waiver negotiations with the U.S. Hook is adamant that “maximum pressure” means just that. “The United States is not looking to grant any exceptions or waivers to our campaign of maximum economic pressure on the Iranian regime,” his statement said. “Our policy is to get to zero imports of Iranian crude as quickly as possible.” But Hook’s comments about oil markets leave room for maneuver, and they echo concerns that Trump raised before granting oil-sanctions waivers last time. Leaving aside possible geopolitical or diplomatic reasons to grant waivers—say, to avoid having to sanction an ally such as South Korea, or to sweeten trade negotiations with China—the oil-prices rationale conflicts with the analyses of other agencies. Energy Department projections say the market has 2 million barrels per day of spare production capacity—more than enough to replace a million lost barrels of Iranian oil per day if needed. The price spike feared last fall has not come to pass. When the Energy Information Administration published its latest projections this past week, the price of oil was $64 a barrel—right about where it was this time last year, though oil prices fluctuate. “If you know the oil markets right now, you know that price is not a factor,” said Amos Hochstein, President Barack Obama’s international-energy special envoy, who managed Iran sanctions. By contrast, in the first two years of Iranian oil sanctions under Obama, he said oil prices were more than $100 a barrel. Still, technical problems will complicate the push to zero Iranian exports. China, for example, is still importing roughly half a million barrels of Iranian oil per day. “It is difficult to sanction China on this issue,” Hochstein said. “They have financial institutions that can facilitate the oil trade that are not engaged in the U.S. financial market, and therefore [are] immune to sanctions.” Separately, however, the administration has used sanctions waivers in other ways. At a conference in December, Christopher Ford, the assistant secretary of state for international security and nonproliferation, noted that even as the administration sought to sanction Iran to drive it to negotiate a better deal, they were seeking to preserve some international cooperation with Iran on things such as civil nuclear research and energy projects. The waivers basically prevent the Europeans from facing sanctions for participating in projects allowed under the deal. There, too, the effect, if not the intent, of the waivers could be to keep in place parts of the basic framework of the deal Trump vowed to eliminate. “We don’t agree that we should have maximum pressure right now, considering that we want the Iranians to stay in the nuclear deal,” said a Democratic congressional aide. “But if you’re going to have maximum pressure, then waivers don’t work.” Even if a Democrat won the White House in 2020, though, he or she might not think it wise to reenter the JCPOA as it currently stands. Robert Einhorn, who helped negotiate the nuclear deal in the Obama administration, noted that some key provisions would expire not long after a hypothetical Democrat took office in 2021. Besides, Iran is, according to the public assessment of the U.S. intelligence community, still abiding by the terms of the deal under current U.S. sanctions—what’s the political benefit of giving up sanctions leverage right off the bat? Richard Nephew, who was the sanctions expert for Obama’s negotiating team with Iran, told me that even if a Democrat made a tactical decision to reenter the deal, “we’ve got to figure out a way to deal with the lost time.” The current terms of the JCPOA, he said, are “rapidly becoming not worth it.” Administration officials have repeatedly said that they seek not regime change but behavior change, and that their goal is to drive the Iranians to the table to strike a better deal. But critics of the “maximum pressure” policy I spoke to, whether or not they supported the Iran deal initially, all agree on one thing: Iran is prepared to wait out the next two years of the Trump administration. “Absent an unforeseen U.S. sweetener, I believe Iran is willing to wait,” Hochstein said. “They’re willing to take the pain. They’ve demonstrated that. They’ve had bad times before.” We want to hear what you think about this article. Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com.

"Are the US, Israel and Saudi Arabia preparing for regime change in Iran?","As The New York Times reported in November 2018, the United States and Saudi Arabia have apparently reached a framework agreement for the sale of nuclear power stations to the Kingdom. The deal is said to be worth up to $80 billion. However, Riyadh is insisting on creating its own nuclear fuel, despite it being cheaper to buy abroad. There can only be one plausible reason for this pursuit of uncontrolled uranium enrichment. Accordingly, US intelligence officials are increasingly concerned with the question of whether Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman, the gulf state’s de facto autocrat often referred to as MBS, is planning to build a Saudi atomic bomb. Those responsible in Washington or Israel do not seem overly concerned by the prospect; in any case, they are doing nothing to challenge the deal. Likewise, the political and media establishment’s indignation over the murder in Istanbul of the Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi – an act most probably endorsed, if not ordered, by MBS – has had next to no effect. Still, a clear bipartisan majority of US senators voted twice at the end of last year to limit President Donald Trump’s authority in the war in Yemen. Although this nearly four-year-old war, which Mohammad Bin Salman could never have waged without the military assistance of the US and the United Kingdom, has unleashed what the UN considers the greatest humanitarian crisis in the world, the protest votes by the US senate have had absolutely no consequences; a change in US policy toward Saudi Arabia is not to be expected despite the Khashoggi murder. The Saudi monarchy is appeased, and, in turn, continues to demonize the Iranian theocracy – a stark world view with sober geopolitical underpinnings. Close American-Saudi ties date back to World War II, for which the meeting between President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the kingdom’s founder, Ibn Saud, on Feb. 20, 1945, aboard the USS Quincy on Great Bitter Lake near Cairo would later assume great symbolic value. Saudi Arabia has since delivered petroleum to the US under preferential terms, and the US has returned the favor by guaranteeing the Saudi monarchy’s security, primarily in the form of enormous amounts of arms exports – nearly 10 percent of all US arms sales go to Saudi Arabia. Weapons for oil – this is one pillar of the special relationship between the two sides. Another dates back to the 1980s, with the triumph of financial capitalism and Saudi investors’ discovery of the American market. There remains not one publicly owned US company without Saudi capital. While the exact level of Saudi investment in the US market is unknown, the figure is thought to be in the hundreds of billions of dollars. And, finally, there is the decadeslong cooperation between American and Saudi intelligence services, which bore fruit during the Iran-Iraq war (1980–1988) as well as during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan (1979–1989). At that time, the Saudis were providing considerable financing to the Mujahideen, the religious fighters deployed as guerrilla troops to fight the Soviets. The Mujahideen would later spawn the Taliban and Al Qaeda – a fact the Washington political establishment is all too happy to overlook. That Saudi Arabia exports not only petroleum, but Islamist terror as well, must have been a painful realization for Americans on Sept. 11, 2001 – 15 of the 19 assassins came from Saudi Arabia. The consequences? None. Yet another reason for the United States’ unwillingness to rock the boat is the common regional archenemy it shares with Saudi Arabia and Israel: Iran. This triangle – or perhaps square, if the United Arab Emirates is thrown into the mix – considers the Islamic Republic to be nothing less than an empire of evil. They all dream of a regime change in Tehran, if necessary by military means. Washington and Israel above all are convinced that Iran is seeking to annihilate the state of Israel. Moreover, Tehran exercises a brand of power politics that leaves the US allies of Riyadh and Abu Dhabi feeling under threat. The Iranian government has indeed engaged in an increasingly aggressive anti-Israeli polemic. For the sake of balance, it should be noted that the Israelis, particularly under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, have seldom endeavored to temper their rhetoric vis-àvis Iran. But can the Islamic Republic actually “annihilate” Israel, even if its current leadership actually desired to? Strictly speaking, this would be impossible for two critical reasons. First, Israel has the atom bomb and Iran does not. The Israelis share no information on their nuclear potential and, in contrast to Iran, are under no pressure to embrace any significant transparency on the matter. Estimates of Israel’s capacity range between 75 and 400 atom bombs, which puts them in a league with the UK and France. Iran possesses no nuclear weapons and in 2003, as confirmed by US intelligence, ceased all attempts to acquire them. A country without the atom bomb is simply incapable of “annihilating” a country that has them. It is objectively impossible. The second reason calls for a look at respective military budgets. In 2017, Iran had a military expenditure of $14 billion, Saudi Arabia $70 billion, Israel $58 billion and the US $750 billion. The numbers speak for themselves. The suggestion that Tehran is pursuing an expansive program of power politics is – in light of US hegemony in the region since World War II – laughable. It is true that Iran understands how to exploit the mistakes and shortsightedness of American policies for its own purposes. In 2001, Washington toppled the extremist Sunni Taliban regime in Afghanistan, the archenemies of Shi’ite Iran. Two years later saw the US-led invasion of Iraq and the demise of Saddam Hussein, which was followed by Iraq’s Shi’ite majority population claiming power from the Sunnis. The new Shi’ite power elite in Baghdad soon allied with their equivalents in Tehran: Who would have thought it? In each case, Washington did Iran a huge favor. The attempt to effect regime change in Damascus – a policy promoted primarily by Hillary Clinton and the neocons and then thwarted by President Barack Obama – was an unconditional failure. Bashar al-Assad remains in power and his military allies in Iran and Russia have been strengthened as a result. But Syria remains in a state of unrest, as Israel and Iran are engaged there in a proxy war of sorts. At the same time, foreign policy decision-makers in Washington are using all possible means to attempt to thwart Trump’s decision to withdraw US troops from northern Syria. The idea of negotiating with Russia and Iran to come to an agreement on a balance of interests in the region feels to them like treason. A dangerous worldview – on Jan. 13, The Wall Street Journal reported that last September, after three grenades exploded in the vicinity of the US embassy in Baghdad, National Security Advisor John Bolton instructed the Pentagon to work on options for taking military action against Tehran. Nothing is known about the perpetrators of the attack, which caused no injuries or damage of any kind. But why worry about facts when it comes to cracking down on Tehran? There are many good reasons to criticize Iranian policy, but despite all the repression in the Islamic Republic, societal conditions in the country are far more complex, multifaceted and, indeed, liberal than in Saudi Arabia. Power lies in Tehran, not in the hands of a single individual, as in Riyadh. And the Iranian authorities, like it or not, act far more rationally and predictably than MBS. Why then does the Islamic Republic sit squarely in the crosshairs of Washington and its regional allies? Iran is the sole remaining country in a wide stretch of land between the Atlantic in the west and Indonesia in the east (with the exception of the little that remains of Syria) with a political system that is neither pro-Western nor pro-American. This, in turn, has causes that go back decades. In 1953, the CIA and MI6 overthrew the democratically elected and extremely popular prime minister of Iran, Mohammad Mossadegh. Two years earlier, he had nationalized the Iranian oil industry – blasphemy in the eyes of London and Washington. In his place they installed as shah, or sovereign of Iran, Reza Pahlevi, also a close ally of Israel. But the repressive policies of his regime led to the Iranian Revolution in 1979. Nary a historian believes that we would have an Islamic Republic today had Mossadegh not been deposed – it is the radical answer to the coup a generation hence. But who in politics, whether in Washington or elsewhere, thinks in historical contexts? The Trump administration is hardly the only Western government to see Iran as the last remaining rogue nation, now that the neocons and their allies have instigated regime change in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya. Their attempts to do the same in Syria have failed – see above. Trump’s May 2018 termination of the Iran nuclear deal forged under Obama in 2015 is the first step toward his goal of Regime Change 2.0 in Tehran. Although the pact’s European co-signers, along with Russia and China, want to continue to adhere to the terms of the deal, the idea has little appeal for the ideologues of America First, also known as the gravediggers of the trans-Atlantic alliance. Prior to a potential attack of Iran by the US and/or Israel, insurgency financing of ethnic and religious minorities in Iran as well as economic sanctions should be maximally employed to bring Tehran to its knees. (Despite its arms expenditure, Saudi Arabia is still militarily a paper tiger.) And Iran’s ballistic missiles are a thorn in the eye for Washington and Israel, as they can jeopardize the safety of attacking aircraft. The presence of Shi’ite militias in Iraq and Syria is particularly unacceptable for Israel, and the same can be said for Iran’s support of Hezbollah in Lebanon. For the Iranians, however, the focus would be on an asymmetrical preemptive defense in the case of an attack. A peaceful alternative to negotiations with Tehran and the retention of the nuclear deal does not exist. Although the regime sits firmly in the saddle, pressure from the Americans is strengthening the hand of the hardliners at the expense of the pragmatists around President Rouhani. An attack on Iran would bring Armageddon to the Middle East. The entire region would explode: Jews against Muslims, Shi’ites against Sunnis. And what if Russia and China were to come down on the side of Iran, against the US? Would it trigger NATO’s Article 5 on collective defense?

"Why does Trump ignore North Korea’s non-nuclear troublemaking?","The important stories of innovation across the continent’s wide-ranging economies In-depth coverage of the world’s largest democracy for India and its far-flung diaspora Lifestyle, culture, and living well in the new global economy Management news, advice, and ideas for business leaders Create, share, and discover charts, using the same tools as the Quartz newsroom A confidential UN report highlights North Korea’s global distribution of missile technology and chemicals weapons, including through a Syrian arms dealer and in the civil war in Yemen, according to Foreign Policy . Why does it matter? This is exactly the kind of activity by Iran that last year led US president Donald Trump to unilaterally pull out of a global non-proliferation agreement with Tehran, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) or simply the Iran nuclear deal. US intelligence officials insisted that all their evidence showed Iran abiding by the JCPOA. But Iran continues to back terrorist groups and funnel money and resources into various proxy wars in the Middle East, and continues to develop ballistic missiles it says are limited to a range of 2,000 km (1,243 miles). With a dubiously binding annex of the JCPOA calling on Iran not to develop missiles at all, the US used it as proxy to pull out. Yet in a matter of days, Trump will sit down for a second time with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un in Vietnam to talk about ending the latter’s pursuit of nuclear armaments while proclaiming they have a “great relationship.” But North Korea, as the UN document but also years of reporting and intelligence work confirm, is just as busy destabilizing the world. Consider that North Korea continues to contribute technology and expertise to the very Iranian missile program that so upsets US officials. North Korea helped Syria develop the chemical weapons (paywall) used by Syrian strongman Bashar al-Assad. The regime’s security forces were behind the brazen assassination of Kim’s brother, Kim Jong-nam, in a Malaysian airport in 2017.  And more than Iran, North Korea is suspected in costly cyber attacks , like a digital heist of Bangladesh’s central bank in 2016 or the attacks on Sony in 2014. But on Feb. 13, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told CBS News that “North Korea behaves very differently. They’re not destabilizing Yemen. They’re not destabilizing Syria. They’re not conducting enormous assassination campaigns. These countries’ behaviors are different.” It’s hard to say that’s truly the case. Arguably, Iran is closer to being a democracy and a rule-abiding member of the international order than North Korea. But the Trump administration’s foreign policy apparently sees North Korea as worthy of honey, while Iran gets the stick. Part of the story may simply be Trump’s desire to reverse the work of the Obama administration, which inked the JCPOA with Iran but failed to achieve a diplomatic opening with North Korea. Now, Trump is bellicose toward Tehran and beatific toward Pyongyang. Trump and his staff also believe that the religion Islam is a unique threat to the United States , which colors their analysis. It’s also difficult to extract US posture towards Iran from regional power politics. In the Middle East, the administration values its relationships with Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the Gulf States, all Iranian rivals, more than it does a consistent approach to nonproliferation or human rights. But in Asia, South Korea and China favor a diplomatic approach to North Korea, while Japan has taken a back seat in recent talks. The problem with this inconsistent approach is that these talks are not taking place in a vacuum. Potential nuclear states keeping a wary eye on the US may deduce that their only protection is to develop nuclear weapons as fast as possible: Nuclear-armed Kim Jong Un is feted by the US while mere aspirants like the Ayatollah are sanctioned, and those without nuclear weapons—Libya’s Muammar Gaddafi and Iraq’s Saddam Hussein—are dead. This is not an incentive that arms control experts think is helpful . And given the lack of any framework for a deal prepared before the summit—recall the years of complex negotiations that led to the JCPOA—few are expecting a concrete denuclearization deal to emerge from next week’s meeting between the two leaders. Given the danger of North Korea , they just hope it won’t get any worse .","https://qz.com/1558132/trumps-risky-nuclear-double-standard-on-north-korea-and-iran/"
"Trump Abandons Iran Nuclear Deal He Long Scorned","Advertisement Supported by By  Mark Landler WASHINGTON — President Trump declared on Tuesday that he was withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal, unraveling the signature foreign policy achievement of his predecessor Barack Obama, isolating the United States from its Western allies and sowing uncertainty before a risky nuclear negotiation with North Korea. The decision, while long anticipated and widely telegraphed, leaves the 2015 agreement reached by seven countries after more than two years of grueling negotiations in tatters. The United States will now reimpose the stringent sanctions it imposed on Iran before the deal and is considering new penalties. Iran said it will remain in the deal, which tightly restricted its nuclear ambitions for a decade or more in return for ending the sanctions that had crippled its economy. So did France, Germany and Britain, raising the prospect of a trans-Atlantic clash as European companies face the return of American sanctions for doing business with Iran. China and Russia, also signatories to the deal, are likely to join Iran in accusing the United States of violating the accord. Mr. Trump’s move could embolden hard-line forces in Iran, raising the threat of Iranian retaliation against Israel or the United States, fueling an arms race in the Middle East and fanning sectarian conflicts from Syria to Yemen. The president, however, framed his decision as the fulfillment of a bedrock campaign promise and as the act of a dealmaker dissolving a fatally flawed agreement. He predicted his tough line with Iran would strengthen his hand as he prepared to meet North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, to begin negotiating the surrender of his nuclear arsenal. “This was a horrible one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made,” a grim-faced Mr. Trump said in an 11-minute address from the Diplomatic Reception Room of the White House. “It didn’t bring calm, it didn’t bring peace, and it never will.” Mr. Trump’s announcement drew a chorus of opposition from European leaders, several of whom lobbied him feverishly not to pull out of the agreement and searched for fixes to it that would satisfy him. It also drew a rare public rebuke by Mr. Obama, who said Mr. Trump’s withdrawal would leave the world less safe, confronting it with “a losing choice between a nuclear-armed Iran or another war in the Middle East.” The response from Iran itself, however, was muted. President Hassan Rouhani declared that the Iranians intended to abide by the terms of the deal, and he criticized Mr. Trump for his history of not honoring international treaties. Mr. Trump won strong backing from Saudi Arabia and Israel, whose leader, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, hailed him for a “historic move” and “courageous leadership.” The restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program under the deal could survive. Three times previously, the president’s aides had persuaded him not to dismantle the Iran deal. But Mr. Trump made clear that his patience had worn thin, and with a new, more hawkish cohort of advisers — led by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the national security adviser, John R. Bolton — the president faced less internal resistance than earlier in his administration. While Mr. Trump had long scorned the Iran deal, threatening repeatedly to rip it up during the 2016 presidential race, his impulse to act now was reinforced by what he views as the success of his policy toward North Korea. He has told aides and foreign leaders that his policy of maximum pressure had forced Mr. Kim to the bargaining table, and that a similar policy of overwhelming pressure would enable the United States to extract a better deal from Iran. As Mr. Trump abandoned one diplomatic project, he accelerated another — announcing that Mr. Pompeo was flying to Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea, to continue discussions with Mr. Kim about the upcoming summit meeting. He expressed hope that three Americans who are detained in the North would be released soon. “The message to North Korea,” Mr. Bolton told reporters, “is the president wants a real deal.” He rejected the suggestion that the United States could not be trusted to keep its agreements when political winds change. “Any nation reserves the right to correct a past mistake,” Mr. Bolton said, citing President George W. Bush’s decision to withdraw from the Antiballistic Missile Treaty in 2001. The Trump administration, he said, would continue to work with Europeans to pressure the Iranians. He dismissed those who said the United States was on a path to war with Iran, though he did not present any new diplomatic initiatives. Another senior administration official acknowledged that there was no Plan B. Months of intense negotiations with the Europeans to keep the accord in place collapsed over Mr. Trump’s insistence that the limits placed by the agreement on Iran’s nuclear fuel production were inadequate. Under the provisions of the deal, those limits, or “sunset clauses,” were to expire in 2030 — 15 years after the deal was signed. As a result, the United States will reinstate all the sanctions it had waived as part of the nuclear accord, and it will impose additional economic penalties that are now being drawn up by the Treasury Department. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin declined on Tuesday to specify what additional sanctions the United States might impose, but he expressed confidence that they would still be powerful even if other American allies did not follow suit. “We do not want to let Iran use the U.S. financial markets and financial system and transact in dollars until they agree that not only will they not have a nuclear weapon now, but we’ve put in provisions that they will never have one,” Mr. Mnuchin said. In his announcement, Mr. Trump recited familiar arguments against the deal: that it does not address the threat of Iran’s ballistic missiles or its malign behavior in the region, and that the expiration dates for the sunset clauses open the door to an Iranian nuclear bomb down the road. Even if Iran was in compliance, he said, it could “still be on the verge of a nuclear breakout in just a short period of time.” In fact, under the deal, the limits on Iran’s uranium enrichment and stockpiles of nuclear fuel mean that Iran would not be on the verge of a nuclear breakout until 2030. Still, Mr. Trump said, the United States and its allies could not stop Iran from building a nuclear weapon “under the decaying and rotten structure of the current agreement.” “The Iran deal is defective at its core,” he concluded. Mr. Trump’s announcement capped a frantic four-day period in which American and European diplomats made a last-ditch effort to bridge their differences and preserve the agreement. That effort began Friday, when Mr. Pompeo called his counterparts in Europe to tell them that Mr. Trump was planning to withdraw from the deal, but that he was trying to win a two-week reprieve for the United States and Europe to continue negotiating. Mr. Pompeo, people familiar with the talks said, suggested that he favored a so-called soft withdrawal, in which Mr. Trump would pull out of the deal but hold off on reimposing some of the sanctions. The next day, the State Department’s chief negotiator, Brian H. Hook, consulted with European diplomats to try to break a deadlock over the sunset provision, under which the restrictions on Iran’s ability to produce nuclear fuel for civilian use expire after 15 years. The Europeans had already agreed to a significant compromise: to reimpose sanctions if there were a determination that the Iranians were within 12 months of producing a nuclear weapon. But officials said that still did not satisfy Mr. Trump, and the Europeans were not willing to go any further. By Monday, the White House began informing allies that Mr. Trump was going to withdraw from the deal and reimpose sanctions on oil and impose new sanctions against the Central Bank of Iran. Under the financial sanctions, European companies will have 90 to 180 days to wind down their operations in Iran, or they will run afoul of the American banking system. The sanctions on oil will require European and Asian countries to reduce their imports from Iran. Mr. Mnuchin insisted that the restrictions would not drive up oil prices because other suppliers would pick up the slack. “My expectation is not that oil prices go higher,” he said. “To a certain extent, some of this was already in the market on oil prices.” Mr. Trump’s decision will test his already frayed relationship with European leaders. President Emmanuel Macron of France, whom the president welcomed with a state dinner two weeks ago, learned of his decision in a phone call with Mr. Trump on Tuesday morning. Later, he said in a post on Twitter that the European allies “regret” his decision. “The international regime against nuclear proliferation is at stake,” he added. In a joint statement, Mr. Macron, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain noted pointedly that the United Nations Security Council resolution endorsing the nuclear deal remained the “binding international legal framework for the resolution of the dispute.” That raises the possibility that the United States will be found to be in violation in the Security Council. Few people were more stung by Mr. Trump’s decision than those who worked for Mr. Obama. Though he has moved methodically to dismantle his predecessor’s legacy, his reversal of the Iran deal was particularly painful, given the five years of effort that went into imposing sanctions, and the more than two-year-long negotiation led by Secretary of State John Kerry that yielded the accord. “No rhetoric is required,” Mr. Kerry said in a statement. “The facts speak for themselves. Instead of building on unprecedented nonproliferation verification measures, this decision risks throwing them away and dragging the world back to the brink we faced a few years ago.” Reporting was contributed by Peter Baker, Alan Rappeport, David E. Sanger, Gardiner Harris and Nicholas Fandos. Advertisement","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/world/middleeast/trump-iran-nuclear-deal.html"
"Report to Congress on Status of Iran’s Nuclear Program","Iran’s nuclear program began during the 1950s. The United States has expressed concern since the mid-1970s that Tehran might develop nuclear weapons. Iran’s construction of gas centrifuge uranium enrichment facilities is currently the main source of proliferation concern. Gas centrifuges can produce both low-enriched uranium (LEU), which can be used in nuclear power reactors, and weapons-grade highly enriched uranium (HEU), which is one of the two types of fissile material used in nuclear weapons. The United States has assessed that Tehran possesses the technological and industrial capacity to produce nuclear weapons. But Iran has not yet mastered all of the necessary technologies for building such weapons. Whether Iran has a viable design for a nuclear weapon is unclear. A National Intelligence Estimate made public in 2007 assessed that Tehran “halted its nuclear weapons program” in 2003. The estimate, however, also assessed that Tehran is “keeping open the option to develop nuclear weapons” and that any decision to end a nuclear weapons program is “inherently reversible.” U.S. intelligence officials have reaffirmed this judgment on several occasions. Obtaining fissile material is widely regarded as the most difficult task in building nuclear weapons. As of January 2014, Iran had produced an amount of LEU containing up to 5% uranium-235, which, if further enriched, could theoretically have produced enough HEU for as many as eight nuclear weapons. Iran had also produced LEU containing nearly 20% uranium-235; the total amount of this LEU, if it had been in the form of uranium hexafluoride and further enriched, would have been sufficient for a nuclear weapon.. After the Joint Plan of Action, which Tehran concluded with China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States (collectively known as the “P5+1”), went into effect in January 2014, Iran either converted much of its LEU containing nearly 20% uranium-235 for use as fuel in a research reactor located in Tehran, or prepared it for that purpose. Iran has diluted the rest of that stockpile so that it contained no more than 5% uranium-235. In addition, Tehran has implemented various restrictions on, and provided the IAEA with additional information about, its nuclear program pursuant to the July 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which Tehran concluded with the P5+1. Although Iran claims that its nuclear program is exclusively for peaceful purposes, the program has generated considerable concern that Tehran is pursuing a nuclear weapons program. The U.N. Security Council responded to Iran’s refusal to suspend work on its uranium enrichment program by adopting several resolutions that imposed sanctions on Tehran. Despite evidence that sanctions and other forms of pressure have slowed the program, Iran continued to enrich uranium, install additional centrifuges, and conduct research on new types of centrifuges. Tehran has also worked on a heavy-water reactor, which was a proliferation concern because its spent fuel would have contained plutonium—the other type of fissile material used in nuclear weapons. However, plutonium must be separated from spent fuel—a procedure called “reprocessing.” Iran has said that it will not engage in reprocessing. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) monitors Iran’s nuclear facilities and has verified that Tehran’s declared nuclear facilities and materials have not been diverted for military purposes. The agency has also verified that Iran’s compliance with the JCPOA. On the JCPOA’s Implementation Day, which took place on January 16, 2016, all of the previous Security Council resolutions’ requirements were terminated. The nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) and U.N. Security Council Resolution 2231, which the council adopted on July 20, 2015, compose the current legal framework governing Iran’s nuclear program. Iran has continued to comply with the JCPOA and Resolution 2231. Iran and the IAEA agreed in 2007 on a work plan to clarify outstanding questions regarding Tehran’s nuclear program, most of which concerned possible Iranian procurement activities and research directly applicable to nuclear weapons development. A December 2015 report to the IAEA Board of Governors from agency Director-General Yukiya Amano contains the IAEA’s “final assessment on the resolution” of these outstanding issues. Then-Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Wendy Sherman explained during an October 2013 hearing of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations that Iran would need as much as one year to produce a nuclear weapon if the government decided to do so. At the time, Tehran would have needed two to three months to produce enough weapons-grade HEU for a nuclear weapon. Iran’s compliance with the JCPOA has increased that time frame to one year, according to U.S. officials. These estimates apparently assume that Iran would use its declared nuclear facilities to produce fissile material for a weapon. However, Tehran would probably use covert facilities for this purpose; Iranian efforts to produce fissile material for nuclear weapons by using its known nuclear facilities would almost certainly be detected by the IAEA.

"Why Russia Wants the Iran Nuclear Deal (Op-ed)","As U.S. President Donald Trump prepares to withdraw from the Joint Comprehensive Plan Of Action (JCPOA) — known in Trump world as “Obama’s bad deal with Iran” — Moscow, surprisingly, has found itself on what might be called the right side of history. Other than Trump’s personal dislike for Barack Obama’s legacy, the United States does not stand to gain by walking away from the JCPOA. There is in fact no U.S. win there, only a mounting tally of international losses. For Moscow, the Trump administration’s criticism of the Iran deal is incomprehensible and pure folly. The U.S. intelligence community together with the IAEA says that Iran is complying with the terms of the deal, and since 2004 has not undertaken any work on building a nuclear weapon. This was spectacularly confirmed last week by Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when he unveiled the Israeli intelligence haul of Iran’s secret nuclear archives in a PowerPoint presentation that commentators said was itself pitched at Trump. Iran's foreign minister, Javad Zarif, responded to the presentation referring to Netanyahu as the boy who cried wolf. BREAKING: The boy who can't stop crying wolf is at it again. Undeterred by cartoon fiasco at UNGA. You can only fool some of the people so many times. pic.twitter.com/W7saODfZDK For all the theatrics, Netanyahu presented no evidence that Iran has been violating the JCPOA since 2015. Yes, Israel exposed Iranian leaders to be perennial liars for denying for years that their “peaceful nuclear energy program” was aiming to build nuclear weapons. But isn’t it what the JCPOA was negotiated for — to deny Iran a fast track to nukes with a tough inspection regime? JCPOA also does not directly address Iran’s missile program (Russia strongly objected to linking the two) but imposes an indirect prohibition on the development of nuclear weapons delivery systems, including ICBMs. There are other UN-imposed limits on Iran’s missile program until 2023. And, of course, there was never going to be an opportunity to agree within the JCPOA framework on curbs to Iran’s malign activities in the Middle East. It simply could not be the subject of negotiations, much to the disapproval of Israel, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf nations. Those add-ons would allow for punitive sanctions on Iran’s missile program and sanctioning Iran’s power projection in the region in return for the United States staying within the JCPOA. The efforts to negotiate such a deal are still continuing, but are likely to fall short with time running out and the United States insisting on phasing out the JCPOA provisions. Moscow realizes that the Trump administration is likely to shoot itself in the foot and isolate the U.S. internationally were Trump to walk away from the JCPOA. From Moscow’s perspective, this is a silver lining. It weakens the U.S. position in the run-up to a highly anticipated Trump-Putin meeting, the details of which are still in the works. Although it could be argued that in hopes of reaching a “grand bargain” with Trump on issues of real importance to Moscow, like Ukraine and sanctions relief, Russia might have been tempted to support Trump on JCPOA and distance itself from Iran, the reality is different. Moscow is too dependent on Iran’s forces in Syria to ensure control and stabilization. It cannot afford to alienate its essential military ally on an issue where Iran’s position has more legitimacy in Moscow’s eyes than Washington’s. The costs of sidling up to the United States are too high for Russia, especially when the geopolitical benefits of currying Trump’s fleeting favor are uncertain and have not even been dangled. The best Moscow can do under the circumstances is to try to form a common position with the EU, China and Iran to keep the JCPOA in place irrespective of what the U.S. does in its moment of madness. Iran might even have its own reasons for staying in the deal too, like keeping economic channels with Europe, China and Russia open, for instance. Were Iran to stay in at Russia’s urging, it would provide a rare diplomatic coup for Moscow.","https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2018/05/08/why-russia-wants-the-iran-deal-op-ed-a61386"

"Iran nuclear deal: negotiators announce 'framework' agreement","EU foreign policy chief and Iranian foreign minister hail ‘decisive step’ in Switzerland after 18 months of intensive bargaining  Julian Borger in Lausanne and  Paul Lewis in Washington  Fri 3 Apr 2015 00.46 BST   First published on Thu 2 Apr 2015 19.37 BST   Iran has promised to make drastic cuts to its nuclear programme in return for the gradual lifting of sanctions as part of a historic breakthrough in Lausanne that could end a 13-year nuclear standoff. The “political understanding”, announced on Thursday night in the Swiss city’s technical university, followed 18 months of intensive bargaining, culminating in an eight-day period of near-continuous talks that went on long into the night, and on the last night continued all the way through until dawn. In a joint statement, the European Union’s foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, and the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, hailed what they called a “decisive step” after more than a decade of work. Speaking afterwards, Zarif said the accord showed “our programme is exclusively peaceful, has always been and always will remain exclusively peaceful”, while not hindering the country’s pursuit of atomic energy for civilian purposes. Speaking at the White House, Barack Obama said that if fully implemented, the agreement would “cut off every pathway that Iran could take to develop a nuclear weapon”. As news of the deal reached Tehran, people took to the streets to celebrate, looking forward to the prospect of life without sanctions. In Washington, meanwhile, there was a clear sign of the battle to come over the agreement, which Republicans have vowed to overturn. Senator Mark Kirk, who is promoting fresh sanctions against Iran, declared that former British prime minister Neville Chamberlain “got a better deal from Adolf Hitler” at Munich. In his remarks in Lausanne, Kerry issued a riposte to rightwing critics of the accord. “Throughout history, diplomacy has been necessary to prevent wars and to define international boundaries, to design institutions, and to develop global norms,” Kerry said. “Simply demanding that Iran capitulate makes a nice soundbite, but it’s not a policy. It is not a realistic plan ... The test is whether or not it will leave the world safer or more secure than it would be without this agreement. And there can be no question that the comprehensive plan that we are moving toward will more than pass that test.” The US president is expected to face intense opposition on Capitol Hill, particularly from Republicans, who are determined to use their control of both chambers of the legislature to undermine an agreement they believe is soft on Tehran. Obama acknowledged there would be “a robust debate in the weeks and months to come” but insisted the agreement was both the most peaceful and effective method to ensure Iran does not obtain a nuclear weapon. “If we can get this done, and Iran follows through on the framework that our negotiators agreed to, we will be able to resolve one of the greatest threats to our security, and to do so peacefully.” The declaration of a framework deal is both preliminary and partial. It does not cover all the issues in dispute and is intended to be only a precursor to a full, comprehensive and detailed agreement due to be completed by the end of June. Before then, the understanding must survive attack from hardliners in Iran and the US. But the joint statement and the details published in Lausanne represent a set of basic compromises that had eluded negotiators for many years. Iran will cut its nuclear infrastructure to the point that western governments are satisfied it would take a year to “breakout” and build a bomb, if Tehran chose to follow that path. At the same time, Iran will open itself up to a level of monitoring and scrutiny of its nuclear programme that is likely to unparalleled anywhere in the world. When all that has been achieved, which could be in as little as six months, the overwhelming bulk of international sanctions would be lifted and Iran would re-enter the global economy. The accord also has the potential to be a turning point in normalising Iran’s adversarial relations with the west, which have been a constant in world affairs since the Islamic revolution of 1979. “This could be one of the most important diplomatic achievements in a generation or more,” said Ali Vaez, an Iran analyst at the International Crisis Group. The UK foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, said: “This is well beyond what many of us thought possible even 18 months ago.” Hammond said that Iran would face stringent monitoring of its programme. “There is a very rigorous transparency and inspection regime with access for international inspectors on a daily basis, high-tech surveillance of all the facilities, TV cameras, electronic seals on equipment, so we know remotely if any equipment has been moved,” he said. But Israel dismissed the deal, and said it would continue to prevent a “bad” final agreement. Strategic affairs minister Yuval Steinitz said in a statement after the announcements in Switzerland: “The smiles in Lausanne are detached from wretched reality in which Iran refuses to make any concessions on the nuclear issue and continues to threaten Israel and all other countries in the Middle East.” Obama spoke to Israel’s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, who told him that a final deal based on the agreement “would threaten the survival of Israel”. Among the main points of the understanding unveiled in Lausanne are: The first major test of the understanding will come in the next few days, when Kerry is expected to present the details to a closed session of the Senate foreign relations committee before a vote on a bill that would give Congress the power to accept or reject any nuclear agreement and another that would impose new sanctions. Zarif, Kerry’s opposite number at the talks, is expected to return to Tehran to a hero’s welcome from a public desperate to escape the shackles of sanctions, but he has frequently warned his fellow negotiators that he will face a backlash from hardliners opposed to dismantling any of Iran’s prized nuclear infrastructure. Kazem Sadjadpour, an Iranian university professor, said on state TV: “I feel very proud as an Iranian … This is a turning point in Iran’s history of diplomacy. This is a night of mourning for Netanyahu and his warmongering allies in the US congress.” The nuclear standoff with Iran has been a threat to global security and non-proliferation for well over a decade since a uranium enrichment plant at Natanz and a heavy water production plant at Arak were exposed in 2002 by an opposition group, probably using Israeli intelligence. Negotiations began in 2003 with European states in which Iran offered to limit its capacity to 3,000 centrifuges if its right to enrichment was recognised. The deal collapsed by 2005 and there was no sign of compromise for the next eight years, as the international community ratcheted up sanctions and Iran responded defiantly by expanding its nuclear programme, moving from production of low-enriched uranium to 20%-enriched uranium, a major step towards the capacity to make weapons-grade fissile material. The confrontation continued to escalate until 2013 and the election of a pragmatist president in Iran, Hassan Rouhani, who acted swiftly to establish lines of communication with the White House and between Kerry and Zarif. An interim deal was agreed in November 2013 that halted production of 20%-enriched uranium and eliminated Iran’s stockpile of the material in return for access to $700m a month of its assets frozen around the world. The interim deal, known as the joint plan of action, bought time for a comprehensive agreement which was initially intended to be completed by July last year. The negotiators gave themselves another four months until November, and then after marathon talks in Vienna, it was postponed again, setting 30 June as the new deadline.","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/02/iran-nuclear-deal-negotiators-announce-framework-agreement"
"The Iran Nuclear Deal, by the Numbers","Assessing the impact of the accord in three charts To assess the impact of the accord that the United States and its partners reached with Iran on Thursday, it is useful to start with five bottom lines. To what questions are 15,000, 12,000, 10, 5, and 0 the answers? Of course, the framework accord still has to be translated into a more specific, binding agreement. And even more important, assuming that is done, the agreement has to be implemented. But if this happens, a state that currently has seven bombs’ worth of enriched uranium and 19,000 centrifuges, and is six weeks away from breaking out to produce the core of a bomb, will have been pushed back materially on each of these fronts. Moreover, the route to a bomb using plutonium rather than uranium, which Iran has pursued for over a decade at its Arak facility, will have been abandoned. For more specific details, see the three tables below from Harvard’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs. The tables summarize the new framework accord and analyze differences between where Iran stood before negotiations began and where it will be if and when this accord becomes reality. Chart 1 simplifies the constraints that the accord places on Iran’s uranium route to a bomb, its plutonium route to a bomb, and the number of years Iran has agreed to observe the constraints. Chart 2 compares Iran’s nuclear capability after the accord is implemented with its program before the interim agreement. Chart 3 tracks the installation of centrifuges at Iran’s nuclear facilities, and illustrates how the accord would reduce Iran’s centrifuge count. By eliminating 12,000 centrifuges and five bombs’ worth of low-enriched uranium, the accord extends the breakout timeline for Iran to produce the highly enriched uranium core of a bomb to one year. By requiring the reconfiguration of Iran’s planned plutonium-producing reactor at Arak, the accord essentially closes this door to a bomb. And by agreeing to establish a new mechanism that will allow unprecedented access for the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to suspicious nuclear sites anywhere in Iran, the accord makes it much more difficult for Iran to cheat. Between this framework accord and a final agreement lie many difficult negotiations. On literally hundreds of specific items, there are countless devils in the details. From my personal analysis of the challenge posed by Iran’s nuclear ambitions, many of these details matter more than the announced constraints on Iran’s enrichment activity at its declared facilities. Most important for me will be requirements for transparency and verification that maximize the likelihood that if Iran attempts to develop nuclear weapons at a covert facility, intelligence communities in the United States and other nations will discover that fact before Iran reaches its goals. In sum, the Obama administration and its indefatigable secretary of state deserve a hearty round of applause for what has been achieved at this point. What remains to be done will be even more difficult, and in the longer run more significant, in stopping Iran short of a nuclear bomb. We want to hear what you think about this article.

"What is the Iran nuclear deal?","The Iran nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action , offered Tehran billions of dollars in sanctions relief in exchange for agreeing to curb its nuclear program. The agreement was aimed at ensuring that "Iran's nuclear program will be exclusively peaceful." In return, it lifted U.N. Security Council and other sanctions, including in areas covering trade, technology, finance and energy. The deal was sealed in July 2015, under President Barack Obama. Tehran acceded to a 10-year restriction on nuclear production , agreed to shut down thousands of centrifuges and exported almost all of its bomb-making material. Under the agreement, Iran agreed that "under no circumstances will Iran ever seek, develop or acquire any nuclear weapons." Iran also allowed a strict monitoring regime, permitting international inspectors to gain access to sites suspected of nuclear weapons-related activities. The agreement did allow for a commercial nuclear program "for exclusively peaceful purposes." Iran signed the agreement with the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council — the U.S., Russia, France, China and the United Kingdom — as well as Germany and the European Union. As of May 2018, there was broad consensus that Iran has abided by the agreement . Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, however, has alleged that "Iran lied" about its nuclear weapon ambitions in the 2000s, although the information he shared seemed to match up with what nuclear inspectors had already reported about Tehran's program. Critics also allege that the deal itself is flawed and does not prevent Iran from engaging in aggressive actions that fall outside the pact’s purview, such as pursuing a ballistic missile program and expiration dates on some restrictions, as well as extending its influence throughout the region. President Donald Trump has made no secret of his dislike for the agreement, calling it “the worst deal ever” while on the campaign trail. On May 8, 2018, Trump announced the U.S. would reimpose sanctions on Iran , leaving other nations involved scrambling to salvage the pact . Restoring sanctions amounts to a U.S. breach of the original deal whereas Iran was deemed to be compliant, according to international nuclear inspectors. On the other hand, some experts see the Iran nuclear deal as a good scenario for denuclearizing North Korea . While the two cases are “very different,” Iran offers lessons to those involved in similar negotiations with North Korea, according to Suzanne DiMaggio, a senior fellow at New America, a Washington think tank where she directs a long-running U.S.-Iran policy dialogue. “The process of diplomacy that the United States pursued with Iran could offer some insights on how to begin engagement with an adversary whose leadership is extremely distrustful of the United States and vice versa,” she wrote in a post for the Arms Control Association. Regional U.S. allies, such as Saudi Arabia and Israel, are vehemently against the agreement, saying it has not worked to curb Iran’s aggressiveness or ambitions. Some of Iran's policies in the Middle East run counter to U.S. interests and those of its allies. Tehran threatens Israel, backs Hezbollah — a powerful Lebanese militia and political group — and is involved in conflicts in Yemen, Iraq and Bahrain. The Trump White House has also been critical of Iran for its support of President Bashar al-Assad during Syria's seven-year civil war. Other countries that signed the deal with the U.S., including allies France, Britain and France , called on Washington to stick to the agreement . French President Emmanuel Macron has said that while it was imperfect, there is no “Plan B.” German Chancellor Angela Merkel has also defended the pact, saying that an imperfect deal is better than no deal and that her country will "watch very closely" to ensure it is being fulfilled. Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif says the deal is "not negotiable." © 2019 NBC UNIVERSAL","https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/smart-facts/what-iran-nuclear-deal-n868346"
"Will the Iran nuclear deal survive Trump’s wrecking crew?","If the US pulls out, we could be heading down the path of another senseless war. That’s why the forces of the UN, Congress and the American public are so pivotal  Fri 27 Apr 2018 11.00 BST   Last modified on Tue 8 May 2018 03.07 BST   O n 12 May, President Trump will decide whether or not to stay in the Iran nuclear deal . If the US pulls out, as Trump has threatened to do, we could be careening down the path of another catastrophic, senseless war in the Middle East. That’s why the countervailing forces of European leaders, the UN, the US Congress and the American public are so pivotal. The US already made a catastrophic blunder in Iran, a blunder that is still reverberating six decades later. In a foreign policy speech delivered in September 2017, Senator Bernie Sanders talked about the 1953 CIA coup that toppled Iran’s elected prime minister, Mohammad Mosaddegh, on behalf of western oil interests, and the reinstallation of the corrupt, brutal and unpopular Shah. Sanders explained that in 1979, the Shah was overthrown by anti-American revolutionaries led by Ayatollah Khomeini, and the Islamic Republic of Iran was created. Then he mused : “What would Iran look like today if their democratic government had not been overthrown? What impact did that American-led coup have on the entire region? What consequences are we still living with today?” To answer Sanders’ questions, without the CIA coup , there would probably never have been an Islamic revolution in 1979 or a decades-long conflict between Iranian leaders and the west. The 1979 revolution impacted the region by unleashing ferocious schisms. The new Iranian Shia leadership began vying for supremacy in the Middle East with Sunni-majority Saudi Arabia, a bitter rivalry that continues today. The 1979 revolution also created a crisis between Israel and Iran , with Iran’s religious leaders viewing the Israelis as US puppets and denouncing the oppression of Palestinians. Today, both the Saudis and Israelis are trying to suck the US into their decades-old feud with Iran. They have both opposed the Iran nuclear deal . Israel has been advocating for the US military to bomb Iran’s nuclear facilities, even though Israel has several hundred nuclear weapons of its own and Iran has none. Saudi Arabia insists that Iran is spreading terrorism throughout the region, even though the Saudis have spent billions of dollars spreading their intolerant version of Islam, Wahhabism, around the world. It is the Saudi’s extremist Sunni ideology , not Shiism, that forms the theological underpinnings of radical terrorist groups from al-Qaeda to Isis. While less oppressive than the Saudi monarchy, the Iranian theocracy is no model democracy. It restricts the freedoms of its citizens and gives the clerics too much power over all other branches of government. But upending the nuclear agreement will be a boon to Iran’s conservative clerics, the very ones we don’t want to embolden. President Hassan Rouhani, considered a moderate, will lose power to the hardliners, who were against negotiating with the west from the get-go. The ascendance of the conservatives could lead to a backlash against the more secular, liberal forces in Iran. Strengthening the hardliners would also spell more chaos in the region. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) is Iran’s elite military force responsible for protecting the Islamic regime from internal and external threats. The IRGC and its allies like Hezbollah are fighting proxy wars against the Saudis from Yemen to Syria. But Trump’s concerns about Iranian support for the “three Hs” – Hezbollah, Hamas and the Houthis – will be exacerbated if the deal is undone, as the IRGC will have an even greater justification to oppose US policies in the Middle East and to target US allies. The IRGC could immediately retaliate by attacking both Israel and US troops stationed in Iraq, Afghanistan and on military bases throughout the Middle East. If the US breaks with the nuclear deal, Iran would be free to reconstitute its nuclear program and quickly move ahead. It could install more centrifuges and produce as much enriched uranium or plutonium as it wants. If US officials are troubled by Iran’s foreign policy now, imagine how much more powerful a nuclear-armed Iran would be. That’s why Trump’s own secretary of defense, James Mattis, has said that keeping the nuclear agreement intact is in the US national interest. It is also why the other signatories to the agreement – France, Britain, Germany, Russia and China – want to keep it. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, just visited Washington DC, trying to convince Trump not to pull out, and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, is meeting with Trump on Friday with the same message. The nuclear agreement was not only made between six nations, but by the entire UN system. The UN security council approved the deal by a 15-0 vote. Putting the deal in jeopardy would compromise the entire international framework for nonviolent conflict resolution and sink international respect for US leadership to a new low. This is a particularly critical point right now, with momentous talks with North Korea tentatively scheduled for May. Breaking the Iran deal will put those talks in jeopardy. Why would Kim Jong-un sign an agreement with Trump if he goes back on a deal already signed with Iran, a deal that Iran was complying with, a deal that was approved by the entire international community? The Trump administration should not only honor the agreement, it should use it as a springboard to work with Iran to defuse the conflicts consuming the region and to normalize relations with Tehran. Unfortunately, the triumvirate of Trump, the national security adviser, John Bolton, and secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, are likely to pull in the opposite direction. It’s up to us to push back. Before the Trump wrecking crew destroys the best global foreign policy achievement in the last decade, the world community – including the UN, Congress and the public – has to stop them.","https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/27/iran-nuclear-deal-survive-trump-wrecking-crew"

            Business  Hours after President Donald Trump blasted the deal as "insane," French President Emmanuel Macron said he expected Trump to pull the United States out next month "for domestic reasons," according to several reports. German Chancellor Angela Merkel is likely to lobby Trump to stick with the accord when she meets him on Friday. Europe is trying to save a deal signed in 2015 under which the United States and other powers agreed to lift some economic sanctions in return for Iran agreeing to rein in its nuclear program. Trump has vowed to rip up the agreement, which he has described as "the worst deal ever." He's now threatening to reject an extension of the agreement ahead of a May 12 deadline. So who loses out if Trump does decide to abandon the nuclear deal?  Iran has the fourth largest crude oil reserves in the world and claims nearly one-fifth of the planet's natural gas. The country has ramped up production since sanctions were eased to about 3.8 million barrels a day. That's about a million barrels a day more than in 2015. New sanctions on Iranian oil exports would put a dent in global supply and could cause prices to spike higher. They've already soared 13% this year to their highest level in three years, and the price of US gas has jumped to a national average of $2.79 a gallon. "A lot of the reason for higher prices is the president's policy on Iran," said Joe McMonigle, senior energy policy analyst at Hedgeye Risk Management last week. "You're talking about a huge amount of oil at risk. You're going to see prices spike."  Related: Surging oil prices rattle President Trump   The biggest deals signed with foreign companies so far have been for airplanes to modernize Iran's creaking fleet.  Boeing  ( BA ) signed an $8 billion deal to sell 80 jets to Iran Air after the sanctions were lifted. The first jets are due to be delivered this year. Boeing has said the airplane sales to Iran Air will directly support tens of thousands of US jobs . The company noted that 100,000 Boeing employees will be involved with making good on the deal. It has also agreed to sell 30 737 MAX airplanes worth $3 billion to Aseman Airlines, another Iranian carrier. European rival Airbus  ( EADSF ) wants a share of the action too. It has agreed to sell 100 jets to Iran for about $10 billion. Those sales could be in trouble if Trump reintroduces sanctions because Airbus uses parts made in America.  While many major foreign companies have remained on the sidelines because of fears over a return of sanctions, a handful have jumped in.  Total  ( TOT ) signed a $2 billion agreement to help develop Iran's giant South Pars gas field, together with Chinese state oil company CNPC. But the French company has cautioned that a tough approach from Trump could kill the deal. "Either we can do the deal legally if there is a legal framework," CEO Patrick Pouyanné told CNNMoney last year. "If we cannot do that for legal reasons ... then we have to revisit it."  General Electric  ( GE ) has received millions of dollars in orders from Iran in 2017, according to company filings, for its oil and gas business. In 2017, Germany's Volkswagen  ( VLKAF ) announced that it will sell cars in Iran for the first time in 17 years.  Travel operators have taken advantage of the renewed interest in Iran as a business and tourist destination since sanctions were eased. European airlines such as British Airways and Lufthansa  ( DLAKF ) have resumed direct flights to the country, and Iranian authorities have relaxed visa requirements. France's Accor  ( ACCYY ) was the first international hotel chain to open in Iran in 2015. Spain's Melia  ( SMIZF ) and Rotana of the United Arab Emirates have also announced plans to open hotels in Iran.  Growth has returned to Iran in recent years, but the economic recovery remains fragile. "As the full suite of American sanctions, including penalties on importing Iranian crude oil, snap back into place, Iran's precarious economic situation will certainly deteriorate," Suzanne Maloney, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, wrote earlier this month. There have been warning signs already. The Iranian rial has plunged against the US dollar in recent months. The currency has lost roughly a third of its value over the past year, and media reports suggest the decline has been steeper on black market exchanges. The fall has made imports more expensive, and some Iranians are reportedly cashing in their savings to buy dollars and euros. Unhappiness over the economy, and the government's management of the situation, helped fuel major protests in late 2017.  -- CNN's Ivana Kottasová and Zahraa Alkhalisi contributed to this report.

"","Iranian President Hassan Rouhani further argued that it is clear that, despite the Trump administration’s denials, the United States is pursuing a policy of regime change in Tehran.  | Mary Altaffer/AP Photo  Foreign Policy By NAHAL TOOSI President Hassan Rouhani of Iran said on Tuesday that the United States under Donald Trump is exhibiting a “Nazi disposition” as it adopts a more unilateral worldview and reimposes a slew of sanctions on the Islamist government in Tehran. Speaking before world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly, Rouhani didn’t mention Trump by name. But there was little question his remarks were aimed at the Republican U.S. president, who Rouhani also suggested lacked intellect. Story Continued Below Trump and Rouhani have been verbally circling each other since Trump pulled the United States out of the Iran nuclear deal earlier this year. The president has since said he would be willing to meet with Rouhani without preconditions, but the odds of that appeared close to zero after Tuesday. Earlier in the day, Trump wrote on Twitter that although he had no plans to meet the Iranian leader during this year’s General Assembly, he was sure that Rouhani “is an absolutely lovely man!” But during his own speech to the world body, delivered before Rouhani, Trump blasted Iran’s clerical leaders, saying they “sow chaos, death, and destruction.” Rouhani spent much of his speech criticizing Trump’s decision to withdraw from the nuclear deal, while expressing appreciation to European nations as well as China and Russia for taking steps to salvage the agreement.

Rather, it is a symptom of a weakness of intellect.” Rouhani further argued that it is clear that, despite the Trump administration’s denials, the United States is pursuing a policy of regime change in Tehran. And while Trump has said it is the Iranians who want to meet him, Rouhani indicated it was the reverse. “It is ironic that the U.S. government does not even conceal its plan for overthrowing the same government it invites to talks,” Rouhani said. Talks between the U.S. and Iran should be held within the framework of discussions about the nuclear deal, not “photo-ops” on the sidelines of the General Assembly, Rouhani said.  foreign policy By NAHAL TOOSI In May, Trump pulled the U.S. out of the nuclear deal, which was negotiated under President Barack Obama. The agreement lifted economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program. Trump has since reimposed the sanctions. Some of the toughest, on Iran’s oil sector, take effect in early November. Trump argued that the deal didn’t do enough to rein in Iran’s nuclear program. He also criticized it for not covering a range of other Iranian activities the U.S. finds objectionable, including its support for terrorist groups and proxy militias across the Middle East. Rouhani said on Tuesday that sanctions were themselves a form of terrorism. But he warned Trump not to underestimate the resiliency of the Iranian people. “The multi-millennial history of our country,” he said, “demonstrates that Iran and Iranians have never broken in the face of a storm of events.” Missing out on the latest scoops?

"SEC Uncertainty Looms Over Token Summit – Again","It looks like Kik won’t sue the SEC after all, founder Ted Livingston told CoinDesk. In a widely circulated story, the Waterloo, Ontario, company had promised legal action against an expected regulatory action, but the odds that Kik will pursue that seem to be diminishing, even if the company’s legal expenses are not . Nevertheless, Livingston would prefer the SEC take any action rather than continuing to delay. “What we’re saying to them is, ‘Stop dragging this out, if you want to go to court, if you think there is an infraction, then let’s go to court,’” Livingston told CoinDesk at Token Summit 2019 in New York City on Thursday. Livingston’s remarks fell in line with a major theme of the summit itself: regulatory uncertainty. The topic had also been a major theme last year and at the summit’s prior iteration in San Francisco . In fact, it has felt like the endless conversation in crypto ever since ERC-20 tokens created a new fundraising strategy: selling access to new networks, rather than ownership stakes. Jae Kwon, of Cosmos, gave a generally positive view of regulators’ efforts, though he still noted gaps. He said it made a lot of sense for regulators to tamp down an ICO market that “wasn’t sustainable.” Still, Kwon noted, “There’s a lot of innovation that’s always ahead of the regulators.” An investor in the space, Ash Egan of Accomplice VC, said this continuing conversation about what’s legal is “taking mindshare away.” He told CoinDesk: “You have to actually think about: Do you want to engage, like Blockstack is, or do you want to ignore it?” Playing by the rules is not cheap. Muneeb Ali of Blockstack took the stage to discuss his company’s Regulation A+ filing with the SEC. The Reg A+ is colloquially known as the mini-IPO and requires much of the same legal legwork. Token Summit co-host William Mougayar said on stage that he had heard Blockstack had spent as much as $2 million to finalize its filing. While declining to confirm that figure, Ali said he expected that if Blockstack got a qualification for its offering to U.S. investors, then future companies would be able to take the same approach at a lower cost. “We are considering it a donation to our industry,” Ali quipped. There are other approaches out there to dealing with regulatory uncertainty. Many members of the larger crypto community appear to support redefining the terms, offering their support for Congressmen Warren Davidson and Darren Soto and their Token Taxonomy Act , which would exempt certain cryptocurrencies from securities laws. Soto, a Florida Democrat, spoke briefly via video, urging attendees to press their own representatives to support his legislation: “As I look to the future of our economy, more and more transactions will be done through cryptocurrency.” For his part, Ali acknowledged the legislative process currently underway but said his company did not feel it could wait. He also said he couldn’t really conceive of following Kik’s approach and challenging the SEC to a courtroom showdown. Timothy Massad of the Brookings Institution didn’t seem to believe the bill had much hope anyway. He said that Soto is the exception among the House Democrats on the legislation because, he believes, most are uncomfortable with how much the bill undermines securities law. An attorney who formerly helmed the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) under President Barack Obama, Massad’s take comes from a Washington insider’s perspective. He also disagrees with the approach. “I wouldn’t agree that this industry is different, that it needs a special exemption from securities law,” he said. He conceded, however, that more clarity is needed and the present course, via enforcement actions, hasn’t been the most efficient. And that’s left a bevy of other problems. One attendee pointed to protocols that suddenly forked themselves. Massad pointed to frontrunning and exchanges with trading desks that use their own customers’ info to make trades. Massad noted: “You’ve got all sorts of problems in the cash market for things that aren’t securities.” But, on that point, another lawyer on the panel noted there are a lot more issues beyond how the law views crypto. Robert Rosenblum, an attorney at Wilson SAonsini Goodrich & Rosati, said his firm has typically seen most cryptos as securities. He said that his coworkers have always felt the gap then was, “So, now what?” In other words, regulators need to explain, if tokens are securities, how the public should buy them and where trading markets can be established. Kwon of Cosmos made a similar point. He noted that no one has any idea how to run a decentralized exchange in a way that’s OK with U.S. regulators right now. But Rosenblum seemed to feel this would and could be worked out. “Only after we have a reasonably well-functioning market, will we have more experience, and a much better framework,” Rosenblum said. How long will that take, though? And that became the underlying question. Slowness tortures a very fast-moving industry. Andreas Glarner, an attorney with European compliance firm MME, said that the view from Europe is that this entire industry is confused: “After roughly five years’ time, the answer is: It’s not clear. Otherwise, we wouldn’t be sitting here. That’s the outside view.” Attorney Nancy Wojtas, a partner at Cooley LLP, said she agreed that the doubts are spurring companies to leave or at least domicile elsewhere, and that’s a concern. Kwon concurred: “If the U.S. is not careful, it’s going to lose its ability to participate.”","https://www.coindesk.com/sec-uncertainty-looms-over-token-summit-again"
"Europe Is Determined to Save the Iran Deal","It has been more than 300 years since Iran and France launched official diplomatic ties. The initial contact between the two nations dates back to the late 16th and early 17th centuries, when the kingdom of Persia tried to secure support from European nations against a powerful neighbor: the Ottoman Empire. France was a popular destination for Iranian kings wishing to spend their time abroad, and Iran was a strategically important country at the crossroads of the Silk Road with unlimited access to the Persian Gulf. This made Iran-France relations particularly close. The two countries maintained cordial ties until the Islamic Revolution of 1979, which changed the political landscape of the Middle East and caused a shift in Iranian foreign policy. Iran-France relations suffered enormously as a result of the anti-Western tone of the revolution, and ties were cut for 11 months following the Gordji Affair . This refers to the case of Wahid Gordji, a translator at the Iranian Embassy in Paris, who was suspected by French intelligence of being behind the 1985-86 bomb attacks in the French capital. There were other reasons for the decline in Iran-France relations. The most controversial surrounded the Iranian nuclear program, which started in the early 2000s and lasted until the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) was agreed in 2015. The JCPOA, or the Iran nuclear deal, was signed by the Iranians and leading world powers, including the US, Britain, France, China, Russia, Germany and the European Union. During the talks, France was accused by the Iranian government of taking a hardline approach. In this edition of The Interview , Fair Observer talks to François Nicoullaud, the former French ambassador to Iran, about the ups and downs of Iran-France relations and the new US sanctions. The transcript has been edited for clarity. François Nicoullaud: Relations between France and the Islamic Republic have seldom been “normal.” From the zenith of the return of Khomeini to the nadir of French support for Saddam Hussein during the Iraq-Iran War and its consequences in terms of bomb attacks and hostage situations, they have gone through a kind of seesaw movement that is still ongoing. Today, President Macron is trying hard to keep the balance equal between Iran on one side and the United States and Saudi Arabia on the other side, but this looks like an almost impossible task, with the very real risk of displeasing everyone. Nicoullaud: I had the luck to be posted in Iran between 2001 and 2005, exactly during the second mandate of President Khatami. This was a time of internal political opening, even if the situation was far from perfect, and also a time of mutual engagement between Iran and Europe, in which France played a crucial role. It was the French foreign minister, Dominique de Villepin, who convinced his English and German partners to go together to Tehran in order to open negotiations on the looming nuclear crisis. This common visit of three major European ministers, which took place in October 2003, was a unique event in the long history of Iran. This first endeavor failed for several reasons after two years of efforts, but the dialogue that was then established never fully stopped. It morphed into different formats and finally led to the conclusion in 2015 of the Vienna nuclear agreement, also known as the JCPOA. Nicoullaud: Personally, I see no rationality behind such a decision. I believe the first motive of President Trump was to destroy President Obama’s most emblematic achievement in the international field. In doing so, he has, among other consequences, offered to the Iranians a gift that they had been dreaming of for a long time without ever coming close to it: a rift between Europe and the United States on a major political issue. Nicoullaud: Without any doubt, the new American sanctions seriously affect French and European trade, which had started booming right after the beginning of implementation of the nuclear agreement in January 2016. See the withdrawal of Total, Airbus, Siemens, Peugeot and Renault. European governments and the European Union do not feel bound by such unilateral American decisions, but this is of little avail. All significant European companies have, one way or another, business interests in the US economy. The American market is obviously more attractive to them than the Iranian market. Therefore, they can be easily convinced by the US administration to abide by American laws, and eventually punished if they do not comply. And European governments, being immersed in a free-market economy, have no way to dictate their behavior to major European companies. Nicoullaud: I do not question the determination of Europe to preserve the JCPOA, but the necessary tools have still to be built and put to use. No magic solution will bring back Total or Siemens to Iran. However, it should be possible to protect at least a steady flow of current trade between Europe and Iran. There are some people working hard on such a mechanism. All of this addresses complex, sensitive issues, and time is needed to produce results. In between, of course, sanctions are producing their effects, so we see a kind of race against time to establish this mechanism. On the other hand, I strongly believe that the Iranians have no interest whatsoever in leaving the JCPOA. What would they gain by restarting producing stockpiles of enriched uranium for which they have no immediate need? By remaining faithful to their commitments, they keep the high moral ground in this quarrel, and this will present visible benefits in the long run. My guess is that most Iranians in charge are quite conscious of this point. Nicoullaud: They could eventually, but certainly not through a bilateral negotiation between Iran on one side and Western countries on the other. Such complex, multifaceted issues can only be solved through a collective engagement involving the other major regional actors. Do you remember the Madrid Conference in 1991, following the Gulf War? It failed miserably because — among other reasons — Iran was not invited, but this is the kind of format one should be thinking of at the end of the ongoing Syrian and Yemeni civil wars. The idea has already been floated for several years, but apparently the time is not ripe. Nicoullaud: The JCPOA negotiators have been criticized for not having included at least the Iranian ballistic issue in their agreement. But one has to understand that such an issue could not be part of the negotiating mandate of the Iranian diplomats. The nuclear issue is a civilian matter. The challenge was to find strong enough limitations to an existing civilian program in order to stop any kind of diversion to military goals. It was therefore normal to have professional diplomats in charge of the negotiation. But the ballistic program is a matter of defense, in the hands of the IRGC [Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps]. There could be no question of letting civilian diplomats meddle with it. To address the issue, it would have been necessary to modify in-depth the format of the negotiation. So, all in all, it was a wise decision from Iran’s partners to agree to limit the deal to the nuclear issue. Aside from this somewhat technical point, one has to understand that a sovereign state cannot accept unilateral limitations to its defense capacity without undermining the very core of its sovereignty. This kind of surrender happens only under duress, usually after being defeated in war. Voluntary restrictions of defense capacities can only take place on a reciprocal basis — be it bilateral or, even better, multilateral. Iran is not the only country to possess ballistic missiles in the region. Any solution to the alleged threat of the Iranian missile program can only be sought at regional level in a framework of mutual concessions. It could start, for example, by a simultaneous accession of Iran and its main neighbors to The Hague Code of Conduct, which provides for a mutual effort of transparency on ballistic arsenals. Nicoullaud: Iran, especially since the foundation of the Islamic Republic, is clearly not a “normal” country. But, after all, is the United States a “normal” country? Is France? Is Saudi Arabia? Is Russia? Is China? It would be interesting to hear from Mr. Pompeo his definition of a “normal country” and see what remains on the map. Nicoullaud: The French-US relationship is going through a rather rocky path. In spite of the efforts made by President Trump and President Macron to develop strong personal relations, in spite of their reciprocal visits to Paris and to Washington, the positions of the two countries have proven to be too far apart on too many important subjects: climate, international trade, European defense and, last but not least, Iran. Articles by guest writers. In very simple terms, France supported Khomeini to live in France. A terrorist like that would not have the same privileges nowadays. French firms, especially automotive ones, have profited from exclusive deals. Put two and two together. I apologize for obtuse personal comments that will be directed to my opinion. It is just this form of discourse that is the foundation of us Iranians not being able to build a tolerant society. Just read them. Ya Ali Mostofi (the bearer of the name of the Prophet of Islam and his son in law) Ayatollah Khomeini (RA) was a savior of Iran. He brought back respect and dignity to Iranian nation. Unlike cursed Shah who was a terrorist and puppet to foreign influences and was trying to bring in corruption to Iran in the name of illusory and fake progress. The sycophants of Shah keep trying to bring back the corrupt Phalavi dynasty. God willing they will fail miserably. Ultimately, when west realizes that Iran is not going to crumple under pressure and war, it and west will have normal relations of equals not that of master and slave. God willing, at that point the prosperity of Iran and middle East will grow tremendously. That progress will happen in spite of efforts of sycophants of shah to undermine it. Pretty soon Élysée will blame Iran, Assad and Hezbollah for fueling and supporting the populist gilets jaunes, all the while supporting a military coup in Venezuela and never letting go of Assad must go. That’s the same government that supports the MEK terror cult as a legitimate opposition group to Iran. France with Sarkozy became a total pundit of the US neocons. Comments are closed.

			});  Richard Falk: The carefully negotiated agreement with Iran on its nuclear program in 2015—formally known as the JCPOA, Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, and informally as the P5+1 nuclear agreement with Iran—was undoubtedly the greatest foreign-policy accomplishment of the Obama presidency. It was achieved despite fierce and unscrupulous domestic opposition orchestrated by the unabashedly pro-Israel Congress, which did all it could to stop the deal from happening, while Black Cube, the private Israeli intelligence firm, was doing its best to block the process by resorting to its bag of dirty tricks.   It should be obvious that the core of the agreement was incredibly favorable to the West, as well as of great benefit to its regional and global nonproliferation goals.    The agreement’s central bargain was an exchange of strict controls on Iran’s nuclear program for phased sanctions relief that was conditional on verification by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that Iran was in full compliance with the agreement. To begin with, it should be obvious that the core of the agreement was incredibly favorable to the West, as well as of great benefit to its regional and global nonproliferation goals. P5+1 was, in some sense, a terrible deal—but not as Trump meant it. Rather, as the Iranian hard-line critics contended. The US government agreed to soften its harsh sanctions program by stage. The sanctions regime was itself questionable, a prime instance of dubious reliance on coercive diplomacy and double standards, given the silence about Israel’s nuclear-weapons capability. Iran’s willingness to accept the most intrusive international inspection commitments ever undertaken was a calculated risk, seeking normalization, which has now resulted in disappointment and betrayal. In other words, Iran accepted major encroachments on the normal scope of its sovereign rights so as to obtain promised relief from sanctions that had caused economic austerity in Iran and considerable suffering by the Iranian people. From a political viewpoint all major states—except, of course, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and US—agree that JCPOA was a huge victory for moderates in Iran when signed, and a severe setback for Iranian hard-liners, who had a far better case for their opposition to its terms than did the pro-Israel forces in 2014–15 and far better than does Trump now. It is notable that Trump’s repeated denunciations of the agreement as “a disaster” and “the worst deal ever negotiated” were never backed up by evidence—there was none—or even by specific allegations, except for the irrelevant charges that Iran was doing political things in the region that Washington opposed, although the United States was doing similar things on a far larger scale.  Iran committed itself in the agreement to a permanent and unconditional renunciation of any acquisition of nuclear weapons at any time. Beyond this, Iran agreed to drastically reduce its stockpile of enriched uranium, by 98 percent; to fundamentally redesign its Arak reactor so that it is no longer capable of producing plutonium; to restrict uranium enrichment to 3.67 percent, when what was necessary to achieve weapons-grade uranium requires 90 percent enrichment; and to reduce the number of centrifuges well below the level needed to amass a sufficient amount of enriched uranium to enable the manufacture of nuclear weapons. Additionally, all phases of the nuclear fuel cycle in Iran became subject to periodic inspections to verify compliance, and the IAEA had broad rights under the agreement to inspect any facility about which it had suspicions. The IAEA has issued 11 reports since the beginning of 2016, when the nuclear agreement went into effect, all indicating compliance. The head of the IAEA, Yukiya Amano, reaffirmed Iranian compliance on May 9 in a carefully worded statement: “Iran is subject to the world’s most robust nuclear verification regime under the JCPOA, which is a significant verification gain.… As of today, the IAEA can confirm that the nuclear-related commitments are being implemented by Iran.” As Susan Rice, Obama’s national security adviser, pointed out , the agreement is about verification, not trust.

			}  Under these circumstances, to withdraw from the agreement and repudiate it by this unilateral move is to undermine the reliability of multilateral diplomacy, compromise the peaceful resolution of disputes, and further erode the authority of international law. This harm to world order is further aggravated by the widespread perception that there were no reasonable grounds for withdrawing, especially given the opposition of other signatories to the Trump repudiation, including by America’s closest allies, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany.   It should be remembered that Iran accepted these unprecedented restrictions on its nuclear program while Israel continues to upgrade the quality of its nuclear weapons arsenal while striking a menacing posture toward Iran.    To break this agreement under these circumstances is shocking and dangerous. It should be remembered that Iran accepted these unprecedented restrictions on its nuclear program while Israel—with no restrictions or even significant international objections—continues to upgrade the quality of its nuclear-weapons arsenal while striking a menacing posture toward Iran. [Washington is doing the same, as noted in this May 14 New York Times article , headlined “As U.S. Demands Nuclear Disarmament, It Moves to Expand Its Own Arsenal.”] Israel makes thinly veiled threats to attack Iran militarily, threats given added credibility recently when Israel launched major military operations at Iran’s military presence in Syria—which incidentally is lawful, as it lends assistance to the legitimate government of the country faced with an insurgent opposition aided by foreign interventions. In both instances, Israel’s behavior involving threats and uses of force are flagrant violations of the key UN Charter prohibition. Recourse to international force is prohibited except in situations of self-defense against a prior armed attack. See Articles 2(4) and 51 of the Charter. DF:  Motoko Rich recently wrote that in announcing the US exit from the Iran nuclear accord, President Trump wanted to “send a signal” about another “hard bargain,” with North Korea. The author was critical of Trump. This clearly isn’t, however, the point of the exit, correct? Noam Chomsky recently indicated to me that the authors of the exit may not even believe in the pretext, and that Trump is on a mission to undo anything set forth by his predecessor to maintain a connection with his base.  RF: As is Trump’s style, his diplomatic moves are undertaken without any clearly articulated rationale that discloses his real reasons for acting so irresponsibly. It is always necessary to probe the real meaning behind the inflammatory language. The Korean dimension could have had some secondary relevance in this context, demonstrating that the United States would, whenever expedient, ignore prudence if it helps to impose its will on a weaker opponent if it resisted a proposed arrangement; but maybe not, given the great differences between North Korea, as a nuclear-weapons state, and Iran, as a non-nuclear state. Perhaps, we can say, as in the instances of Iraq and Libya, that they were attacked because they didn’t have nuclear weapons, and that Iran is under threat precisely because it lacks such a nuclear deterrent.     var inline_cta_text_281734            = '';

			}    It seems evident that Trump’s primary motivations had to do with Middle Eastern politics, and especially the relevance of Israel’s and Saudi Arabia’s undisguised resolve to achieve regime change in Tehran.    On the surface it seems evident that Trump’s primary motivations had to do with Middle Eastern politics, and especially the relevance of Israel’s and Saudi Arabia’s undisguised resolve to achieve regime change in Tehran. As with Trump’s internationally condemned decision, announced last December, to move the American embassy to Jerusalem, the geopolitical motives of withdrawal from the agreement are obscure, and likely ill-conceived, but the domestic and transnational incentives are clear—pleasing major Zionist donors to the Trump campaign, Sheldon Adelson, Bernard Marcus, and Paul Singer, and further cementing transnational solidarity with [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu and [Saudi Crown Prince] Mohammed bin Salman. This is not idle speculation. Several Washington insiders have reliably confirmed these sources of influence on the Trump decision. There are other factors present. Repudiating the agreement with Iran is one more example of Trump’s deliberate assault on multilateralism—compare this to his withdrawal from the Paris climate-change agreement and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and his hostility to the UN and NAFTA. It seems to be Trump’s way of fulfilling his campaign pledge of “America First,” as if that were not the approach of the pre-Trump leaders who occupied the White House. What Trump evidently meant was that putting America first required ending international entanglements that weakened the ability of the United States to get the best of others in diplomatic settings. It is sometimes explained as a shift to “a transactional approach,” in which the United States uses its leverage and power to the fullest, without taking into account law, morality, and the sentiments of allies.    /*

		}  [Chomsky is correct in that] Trump seems obsessed with undoing the positive achievements of the Obama presidency across the board, from health care and empathy toward undocumented immigrants to environmental protection and foreign policy. In this sense, the P5+1 agreement must have seemed an irresistible target, enabling Trump to undermine, simultaneously, multilateralism and the Obama legacy, and as a side benefit to receive praise from Israel and Saudi Arabia. Whereas Obama sought—usually vainly—bipartisan support for domestic initiatives and mobilized international support—usually effectively—for global policy undertakings, Trump’s bluster, bullying, and bluffing represent a dysfunctional, if not toxic, combination of unilateralism and neo-isolationism.  Related Article         Donald Trump Is Driving Us on a Road to Hell in the Middle East  Michael T. Klare    DF:  Robert Kelly, a political-science professor at Pusan National University in South Korea, remarked that “only a fool would trust the US to keep its word in a rogue state nuke deal now.” This sounds basically correct, no?  RF: I am not sure about this. It depends on whether leaders around the world see Trump as representing the true nature of American diplomacy or as a temporary anomaly to be soon superseded by a return to more dependable and familiar patterns of American leadership in world affairs. In the immediate future, the United States as a partner to international arrangements is certainly unreliable and untrustworthy, but worse, recklessly irresponsible, putting the country and Middle East on a path leading to an unpredictable war with likely catastrophic consequences for the countries involved and for a region already long victimized by intervention, chaos, and oppression. DF:  How is the state of Israel connected to the exit, and what do you think is at stake for Netanyahu?  RF: In important respects, the US exit is more about Israel than the terms of the agreement. It is important to keep in mind that the Trump presidency does not even bother to charge Iran with noncompliance or point to specific failures of coverage in the text of the agreement. Instead, it heeds Netanyahu’s warmongering efforts to discredit the agreement by reference to allegations of Iranian cheating that go back before the agreement was signed and were never persuasive, except now, belatedly, to the Trump White House, and to advisers like John Bolton and Mike Pompeo, who have never been shy about their desire to confront Iran militarily with the objective of replacing the present government. It is hardly coincidental that Israel launched its biggest attack on the Iranian presence in Syria less than 24 hours after Trump’s formal announcement, as if awaiting a signal. That followed the visit of Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman to Washington a few weeks ago, featuring meetings with James Mattis, his American counterpart. When Lieberman returned home he let it be known that Israel could do whatever it wished in the region, especially in Syria and Iran, and still feel confident of receiving American diplomatic and, if necessary, military support. And of course the domestic pressures from a passionately pro-Israel Congress—reinforced by the AIPAC super-lobby and, further, the billionaire donors—create for Trump a win-win at home that seems to count more for this White House than the lose-lose with respect to national interests, alliance relations, and global diplomatic reputation. In light of these developments, it would be useful for all of us to reread the Mearsheimer/Walt critical assessment of the distorting impacts of the Israel lobby on the rational pursuit of American interests in the Middle East. While the lobby was virulent and powerful when their book was published, and of course attacked, back then the pro-Israel bias was at least somewhat subtler.     var inline_cta_2_text_281734            = '';

			}  DF:  Stephen Zunes pointed out that “Trump’s strategy appears to encourage the Iranians to resume their nuclear program in order to provoke a crisis that would give the United States an excuse to go to war.” This sounds plausible but very frightening. Can you talk about the likely outcome? Is it this bleak?  RF: I think this line of thinking is plausible, although it posits that Iran will react almost as mindlessly as Trump. Much depends on how the internal tensions in Iran play out, and whether this Trump roadblock undermines President Hassan Rouhani’s determined effort to push Iran toward moderation at home and normalization abroad. The Iranian response will become clearer when and if the supreme guide, Ayatollah Khamenei, takes a policy stand that goes beyond his angry statement in reaction to the Trump withdrawal. So far, Iran seems to be sensibly following a course of seeking to weaken the impact of the US decision to reimpose sanctions by appealing for compensatory relief to China, Russia, France, the UK, and Germany, all of whom have reaffirmed their commitment to maintain the P5+1 approach. If Israel’s provocations continue, and an Iranian retaliation follows, then both regional war and a resumed unshackled Iranian nuclear program are highly likely. This would mean an expanded war zone and a likely nuclear-arms race involving all the major states in the Middle East. At least, so far, the United States has not fanned the flames further by invoking the so-called “snapback provision” in the agreement, which allows any of the six state parties to demand the reinstatement of UN sanctions, which were very burdensome in the period from 2006 to 2013, and are credited in the West with bringing Iran to the negotiating table. After the agreement was reached and UN sanctions suspended, the effect was to enhance greatly the stature and popularity of Rouhani’s moderate line within Iran. DF:  The nuclear agreement with Iran has been called a “one-sided deal” by the Trump administration. Some in Iran might agree with that, but for different reasons. Can you talk about how the United States has undermined the agreement almost from the start?  RF: As indicated earlier, the terms of the agreement are certainly one-sided, but mainly by promoting the nonproliferation priorities of the West. What most provoked critics about the terms of the deal was that it did not purport to regulate Iran’s political activities in the region: its support for Damascus in the Syrian civil war, its close ties with Hezbollah, its help to the Houthis in the Yemen war, and its positive relations with Hamas. As almost anyone would agree, this was not part of an understanding about Iran’s nuclear program, and Iran’s diplomacy is a far tamer version of what the United States, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and others have been doing for many years in the Middle East. There is also an evident American frustration with its prolonged effort to reverse the outcome of the Iranian Revolution ever since Washington’s support for Iraq in its 1980s war with Iran ended surprisingly in a defensive victory for Iran. The persisting covert operations to destabilize the governing process in Tehran, including the assassination of Iranian nuclear scientists and the insertion of a virus in Iran’s centrifuges, did not achieve any changes in Iranian policy. And most of all, the American war of aggression against Iraq in 2003, undertaken to put an iron wall around Iran, resulted in an outcome directly opposite to what was anticipated, a leadership that was more responsive to Tehran than to Washington.  Nothing has better demonstrated the failure of American leadership to understand Iran and the region generally than these failed policies of confrontation with Iran over the course of decades. Trump has brought that failure into the open by the crude escalation of tensions and by his mindless display of coercive diplomacy, which has struck a far bigger blow against American credibility as a global leader than it has against the legitimacy and viability of the Iranian government. It is necessary to observe the unfolding of events in the weeks and months ahead, but nothing more persuasively demonstrates the blunder of repudiating the P5+1 approach than the fact that the best that can be hoped for by rational commentators is that the effects of withdrawal will be somehow neutralized by the ineffectiveness of restored sanctions and the energetic efforts of the five governments that remain committed to keeping the agreement alive. If the agreement can be made to work in spite of this obstructive behavior of the United States, it may ironically be viewed in retrospect as the start of a new muscular phase of multipolar geopolitics. This would imply a decisive weakening of the hegemonic US role, with reverberations far beyond Iran, the Middle East, and the nuclear-nonproliferation regime. If developments unfold in roughly this manner, it could also produce a costly blowback to Trump’s presidency, which is already the least popular since the end of World War II.

"A Dummy's Guide to the Iran Nuclear Deal","A historical accord, or a historical mistake? Depends on whom you ask, and what they had at stake. After months of preparation, two weeks of final intensive discussions in Vienna and with eight parties involved, the final result was an agreement with five annexes. The Iran Nuclear Deal made headlines across the globe as a landmark historical agreement between extreme opponents. The deal laid out a lengthy process spanning over 15-25 years that would be supervised by an eight-member committee, including Iran, the United States of America, Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China and the European Union. In a nutshell, the agreed-upon nuclear deal aimed at limiting Iran's ability to produce a nuclear weapon, in exchange for the removal of various sanctions imposed on it internationally. However, the deal got a significant shake-up under U.S. President Donald Trump, who on May 8, 2018, announced that the U.S. would be pulling out of the deal and issuing fresh sanctions against Iran. Based on the revelations of an Iranian exile group in 2002, Iran was suspected to have nuclear facilities. Following inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) and subsequent discoveries, Iran continued to proceed with nuclear developments despite international opposition. In 2006, the United Nations imposed sanctions on Iran, which were followed by similar actions from the U.S. and the EU. Bitter confrontations then broke out between Iran and the world powers. These sanctions – primarily on Iran's oil business, weapons sales and financial transactions – had severely hurt Iran’s economy. As one of the largest producers of crude oil , prices went through a volatile period as the outcome was largely unknown. The deal was negotiated between Iran and a group of counterparts that included the US, Russia, Britain, Germany, France, China and the EU. The supporters of the nuclear deal affirm benefits, which include the best-possible guarantee from Iran that it will refrain from producing a nuclear arsenal. It was, at the time, an important step toward establishing peace in the Middle East region, particularly in the context of ISIS and the role of oil in Middle East economies . To make nuclear bombs, the uranium ore mined from earth needs enrichment to either uranium-235 or plutonium. Uranium ore mined from earth is processed via devices called centrifuges to create uranium-235. Uranium ore is processed in the nuclear reactors which transform it into plutonium. Under the deal, Tehran would reduce the number of centrifuges to 5,000 at the Natanz uranium plant – half the current number. Nationwide, the number of centrifuges would reduce from 19,000 to 6,000. The enrichment levels would be brought down to 3.7%, which was much lower than the 90% needed to make a bomb. The stockpile for the low-enrichment uranium would be capped to 300 kilograms for the next 15 years, down from the present 10,000 kilograms. All these measures served to restrict Iran's capability to make a nuclear bomb and would ensure nuclear power usage is limited to civilian use only. As the deal was finalized, a UN Security Council resolution was agreed upon. By August 15, 2015, Iran would submit written responses to the questions raised by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), about its nuclear program and developments. Additionally, it allowed monitoring of its facilities by IAEA inspectors on or before October 15, 2015. First, the oil embargo that prevented the import of oil from Iran was removed, which was not without its effects. The U.S. and EU lifted oil and trade-related sanctions. Foreign companies began to purchase oil from Iran, US companies located outside the U.S. were authorized to trade with Iran, and imports of selected items from Iran were permitted, which had a particular effect on international business . Simultaneously, sanctions on Iran’s banking and financial systems were dropped. It enabled the immediate release of around $100 billion currently lying frozen in Iranian bank accounts overseas. Immediately after the announcement, government officials from major European countries began visits to Iran to explore business opportunities. Some of the main challenges faced by Iran during the sanction period were Iran's shrinking GDP , high inflation (between 50% to 70% in 2013), and the nation being cut-off from world economic systems. All such economic challenges drastically improved after the agreement. Lifting sanctions would allow the movement of huge supplies of oil from Iran, which was thought to be sitting on large stockpiles due to years of imposed sanctions. International oil companies like France’s Total and Norway’s Statoil operated in Iran for years before sanctions were imposed, changing the tide for those countries and other top oil producers in the world. European car manufacturers like Peugeot and Volkswagen were market leaders in Iran prior to the sanctions. Although a few sectors like auto, oil, and infrastructure had significant interest from foreign companies in the pre-sanction era, the reality was that foreign businesses had limited presence in Iran since the 1979 Revolution. In essence, the Iranian markets had remained largely unexplored by international businesses across many other industry sectors. Former U.S. President Barack Obama claimed that the deal would make the U.S. and the world a safer place. However, concerns remained. Challenges included administrating and monitoring the atomic facilities and developments in Iran. Complete awareness was required about the existing labs, establishments, underground sites, research centers, and military bases associated with nuclear developments. Though Iran agreed to provide the IAEA higher levels of information and deeper levels of access to all nuclear programs and facilities in the country, the picture remained murky. The deal, although welcomed by a larger group of nations across the globe, also had opposition from a few prominent world leaders. Israeli leader Netanyahu said the deal "paves Iran's path to the bomb." His vehement opposition to the deal came on the basis of Iran’s history of being a nuclear-capable challenge for the Middle East region. Additionally, Netanyahu said the deal was a platform to fund and nurture a nuclear-capable, religious-extremist country, saying a strengthened Iran could hinder peace and security in the region. After the election of President Trump in November 2016, proponents of the deal feared the agreement, which they saw as a win for world peace, would be back on the table. And in October 2017, their fears were confirmed. Trump announced that he would decertify the deal. What did this mean? Under the terms, the U.S. President was required to sign off on the deal every 90 days, which he announced he would not do, accusing Iran of sponsoring terrorism. Trump has also said that he would deny Iran "all paths to a nuclear weapon." Not surprisingly, Trump's decision was met with instant condemnation. The European Union foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, was the first to weigh in saying the deal was "robust" and said there had been "no violations of any of the commitments in the agreement." After Trump's decision, Congress had 60 days from that time to reinforce sanctions, and given the hostility within the Republican party, an agreement to reinstate appeared possible. The pros and cons of such a landmark deal were and will continue to be debated. Most views, claims, and allegations are often politically tuned. For now, the majority across the globe appears to be positive about the Iran nuclear deal. However, after President Trump decertified the agreement the future became murkier.

Reprinted by permission of PublicAffairs. In the international negotiations that resulted in the 2015 agreement to limit Iran’s nuclear activities , I led the team of American diplomats representing the United States. During the talks, my Iranian counterparts would occasionally ask how they could be assured that any deal we struck would be durable. Most Republicans opposed it, and looking at the forthcoming 2016 U.S. presidential election, the Iranians wondered what would happen if the GOP took the White House. I would answer by asking them a similar question: “What if hard-liners opposed to the deal regained power in Iran?” It usually ended the discussion, as I thought it should: after all, I always expected that the greatest challenge to the deal’s success would be violations by Iran, not the political machinations of the president of the United States. Of course, I was wrong. In May of this year, U.S. President Donald Trump decided to pull the United States out of the agreement and reimpose the U.S. sanctions on Iran that the deal had lifted, a move that will go down as one of the worst foreign policy blunders in U.S. history. The Iran deal was not perfect; no deal ever is. Nonetheless, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), as the agreement is formally known, offered the best possible assurance that Iran would never obtain a nuclear weapon. I don’t know if the Iran deal can survive the reinstatement of sanctions , which the United States set aside in exchange for the Iranians’ pledge to vastly reduce their uranium enrichment, produce no weapons-grade plutonium, and allow international inspectors to rigorously verify their compliance. The JCPOA’s restrictions close every possible path for Iran to obtain fissile material for a nuclear weapon. Although some of the restrictions that the deal places on Iran end after 10, 15, 20, or 25 years, its prohibition on Iran’s obtaining a nuclear weapon never ends. So far, the Iranians have stuck to the terms of the deal. Trump’s decision Loading, please wait... This site uses cookies to improve your user experience. Click here to learn more.

US announces pullout from treaty with Russia that's been a centerpiece of nuclear arms control since the Cold War. (Feb. 1) AP WASHINGTON – The Trump administration will halt U.S. compliance with a nuclear arms control treaty with Russia, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Friday, citing Moscow's "brazen" violations of a pact that has been a cornerstone of nonproliferation since the Cold War. "For almost six years, the United States has gone to tremendous lengths to preserve this agreement," Pompeo said. He said the Kremlin's repeated denials that it has developed a covert missile system in violation of the treaty has left America and its European allies at immense risk. "Russia has jeopardized the United States' security interests, and we can no longer be restricted by the treaty while Russia shamelessly violates it," Pompeo said. The U.S.  suspended compliance with the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty , known as INF, on Feb. 2 and began a six-month formal withdrawal process, Pompeo said. That gives Moscow time to reverse course – even as the Trump administration begins to look at developing and deploying new intermediate-range missiles. "We will move forward with developing our own military response options and will work with NATO and our other allies and partners to deny Russia any military advantage from its unlawful conduct," President Donald Trump said in a statement on Friday. Supporters of the move said it was long overdue after years of trying to cajole Russia back into compliance proved fruitless. “The Russian government has had endless opportunities to change their bad behavior and ... has proven its disinterest in doing so," said Sen. James Risch, R-Idaho, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. "The time has come to set the treaty aside and develop alternative avenues toward the security the treaty once provided.” NATO's secretary-general said Tuesday he is confident that both the Western military alliance and Russia "will act in a respectable way" as the two sides hold drills in the same area in waters off Norway's coast. (Oct. 30) AP The administration's decision will free the United States to confront other emerging security threats, principally China's buildup of intermediate-range missiles. But critics said abandoning the 32-year-old treaty could spark a new arms race, undermine American credibility and put Europe at risk of Russian aggression. “Russia’s brazen noncompliance with this treaty is deeply concerning, but discarding a key pillar of our nonproliferation security framework creates unacceptable risks," said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. "The administration should exhaust every diplomatic effort and work closely with NATO allies over the next six months to avoid thrusting the United States into a dangerous arms competition." Though experts do not dispute Russia's violations, proponents of arms control argue the U.S. decision will allow Russia to be more overt and aggressive. "This really changes the dynamic where Russia could deploy systems are that are much more offensive and that upsets the security balance in Europe, because it can hold at risk a lot of the countries who are NATO allies and partners," said Rachel Ellehuus, deputy director and senior fellow with the Europe Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. Russia will now be able "to turn the narrative on the United States and NATO and essentially say 'We need to defend ourselves, and the way we defend ourselves is by deploying these systems in our neighborhood,'" Ellehuus said. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Friday that Russia greeted the decision with "much regret" and blamed the U.S. for the INF's collapse. He said Washington has been “unwilling to hold any substantial talks” to save it. The INF Treaty, signed in 1987 by President Ronald Reagan and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, bars the U.S. and Russia from deploying ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges of  310 to 3,400 miles. The agreement led to the elimination of nearly 3,000 missiles with nuclear and conventional warheads and contributed to the end of the Cold War. But the U.S. has long accused Russia of violating the pact – stretching back to the Obama administration. European leaders also have accused Russia of cheating on the agreement, even as Kremlin officials insisted Russia was in compliance. In a statement Friday, NATO strongly backed the Trump administration's move and said Russia was to blame for the U.S. decision. "The United States is taking this action in response to the significant risks to Euro-Atlantic security posed by Russia’s covert testing, production, and fielding of 9M729 ground-launched cruise missile systems," NATO said in its statement. "Allies fully support this action." It's not clear yet how European allies will respond. It's possible that NATO would allow the U.S. to deploy ground-launched missiles in Europe, but that step probably would provoke Russia even more and would risk a public backlash across the continent. "NATO continues to closely review the security implications of Russian intermediate-range missiles and will continue to take steps necessary to ensure the credibility and effectiveness of the Alliance’s overall deterrence and defence posture," NATO said Friday. "We will continue to consult each other regularly with a view to ensuring our collective security." Ellehuus said the Europeans could move in one of two directions. "They could argue 'Gosh, we need a stronger nuclear deterrent,' and then we’re in a new arms race," she said. "Or they could say: 'You know what? The U.S. doesn’t have our back anyway; we want all U.S. nuclear weapons out of Europe.'" A senior administration official, who was not authorized to speak on the record, said the Pentagon has started on research and development of intermediate range missiles. But the U.S. is not close to making any decisions about whether and how such weapons would be deployed, the official said, adding that the administration is focused on conventional, not nuclear, missiles. “We are only looking at conventional options at this time,” the official said. “Nothing the United States is currently looking at is nuclear in character.” This official also emphasized that any decisions about deployments would be made in close consultation with NATO allies. He  said Friday’s decision was not a signal that the U.S. would pivot toward an arms race with China, although he noted that China has more than 1,000 intermediate-range missiles. And in discussing the INF withdrawal decision last year, Trump National Security Adviser John Bolton noted that China was not bound by the treaty and argued that Beijing represents a growing threat to the U.S. "Exactly one country was constrained by the INF Treaty: the United States,” Bolton said while in Moscow in October . In the meantime, Bolton said, China, North Korea and Iran “are free to do whatever they want” and have made “very substantial strides” in developing intermediate-range missiles. Some experts say the administration's withdrawal from the pact also jeopardizes a second nuclear arms control agreement with Russia known as New START that expires in 2021. The Russians have asked the U.S. to begin negotiations on an extension of that agreement, but so far the Trump administration has not agreed to do that. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announces the US withdrawal from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty at the State Department in Washington, DC, USA, 01 February 2019. The US withdrawal from the Cold War agreement, which prohibits ground-based nuclear-tipped cruise missiles with ranges of 310 miles to 3,420 miles, comes after talks with Russia to save the treaty broke down.  (Photo: JIM LO SCALZO, EPA-EFE) Asked if the Trump administration was committed to extending New START, Pompeo did not answer directly. He said Trump was committed to reducing the proliferation of nuclear weapons but said, "It does no good to sign an agreement if a party is not going to comply with it." Experts say Russia is in compliance with New START, and the administration has not accused Russia of cheating on the pact. Steven Pifer, a fellow at Stanford University's Center for International Security and Cooperation, said the Trump administration's refusal to begin those complicated negotiations is worrisome and a sign it may want to see that treaty expire. "There’s a very early and an unfortunate possibility that in 2021, for the first time in five decades, you have no negotiated limits on U.S. or Russian nuclear forces," Pifer said. He said that would severely undermine global non-proliferation. The U.S. would no longer have credibility, he said, to press North Korea and other rogue states to give up their nuclear arsenals if America has abandoned its own arms-control agreements. Indeed, Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif used Friday's news to jab the U.S. as an unreliable negotiator, a theme he has hit on since Trump's decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear accord, known as the JCPOA. "Yet another withdrawal from an accord by the Trump administration; this time the #INFTreaty," Zarif tweeted. "It's not just the #JCPOA or Iran: Seems this clique is allergic to anything w/ US signature on it. Message: Any deal with US govt is not worth the ink; even treaties ratified…" JZarif: Yet another withdrawal from an accord by the Trump administration; this time the #INFTreaty .

"Digital Renminbi: A Fiat Coin to Make M0 Great Again","Contrary to what many think, China does not oppose blockchain technology. Rather, it takes issue with bitcoin and other privately issued cryptocurrencies, which it fears may facilitate financial fraud and capital flight. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has, in fact, had an initiative for issuing a blockchain-based digital renminbi (RMB) since 2014. The project has already generated 71 patents and has initiated a trial operation for an interbank digital check and billing platform. If successful, this digital RMB project could expand the central bank’s influence over both the domestic and international economy. It has broad implications for the geopolitics of money and for the future of private cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. To understand the PBOC’s motives, we must first distinguish between the digitalization of fiat currency and digital fiat currency. They are not the same thing. Each has a very different impact on the money supply and on the power balance between central banks and commercial banks. The digitization of currency, which stems from the advent of electronic payment/clearance and mature interbank IT systems, allows commercial banks to more efficiently and independently generate the credit flows that expand broad money supply, or M2. By contrast, digital fiat currency, enabled by blockchain technology, affects the base currency measure known as M0. Traditionally, central banks directly control base money creation/destruction but have only indirect power over the broader, credit flow-driven monetary supply. Now, with digital fiat currency, they have the potential to bypass commercial banks and regain control of currency creation/supply end to end, thereby structurally centralizing their power in policymaking. The PBOC’s interest in this solution comes as highly advanced digital payment systems like Alipay and WeChat have created a cashless and cardless economy. This is a form of currency digitalization, built upon a network of commercial bank accounts, operating at the M2 level of money supply. By contrast, a digital RMB would be integrated into M0, thus restoring control and influence to the PBOC. As the Vice President of PBOC Fan Yifei put it in a public interview: “With the help of technology innovation, we can gradually transit into issuance and circulation of digital RMB and impose effective supervision of in the private sector.” From 2007 to 2017, China’s M2 supply grew from 40 trillion RMB to 170 trillion RMB ($25.5 trillion), with an average annual growth rate of 15%, far outpacing the 10 percent nominal GDP growth rate over the same period. This massive expansion is largely due to the excessive issuance of commercial bank loans, primarily for real estate development, local governments’ infrastructure projects, and state-owned enterprises. It has led to a highly leveraged banking system and left a huge debt risk hanging over the Chinese economy. What’s more, the measurement of M2 underestimates the real currency growth rate in China due to shadow banking. High-yield “wealth management products” and structural deposits offered by banks, as well as internet financing such as P2P lending, make up a separate financial industry that’s worth 70 trillion RMB. Wealth management products alone have grown from a 0.5 trillion RMB industry in 2007 to a whopping 30 trillion in 2017. These are not counted as M2 and are often hard to track due to their being hidden from bank balance sheets, making it even harder for the PBOC to manage the Chinese economic cycle. Current attempts to address the problem largely consist of more stringent reporting and regulation, but this merely chases behind the problem rather than stamping it out. To get ahead of it requires a new financial system altogether. That’s what’s intended with the Digital RMB, a project that’s conceived of as a means of reasserting monetary control in the interests of financial stability. While the PBOC is still considering different possibilities for network design, it seems likely to be a permissioned network in which nodes are controlled by the PBOC and major Chinese banks. This suggests transactions will be visible to the banks and government, but not to the public. According to Yao Qian, the head of PBOC Digital Currency Research Center, the designated PBOC digital currency system has a few key elements: Some might wonder why blockchain or distributed ledger technology (DLT) is needed at all if nodes are not highly decentralized. The answer is that a blockchain model offers a better coordination paradigm compared to traditional currency supply management, which is heavily dependent on bookkeeping. Blockchain’s tamper-proof nature and private-key cryptography prevent false transactions and counterfeiting, while also making it much easier for the PBOC to manage the circulation flow. The issuance of a digital RMB will not only make cash and coinage obsolete (which is already happening in China), but also make commercial banks and M2 easier to control. It means the PBOC can more effectively control and regulate an overextended debt market. Thanks to blockchain’s traceability and programmability, it will become much more difficult to hide banking products and services from balance sheets. This also allows for easier execution and more accurate assessment of monetary policy, and makes the measurement of currency supply, circulation speed, currency multipliers, and distribution much more accurate. PBOC can write rules at the code level regarding where digital RMB can and cannot flow to. If it wants to cool down the housing market, for example, it can simply set a program preventing digital RMB from entering the real estate sector. As for policing individuals, a person’s spending history and assets balance are immediately evident on the blockchain, making it much easier to accurately assess creditworthiness, detect money laundering, and prevent tax evasion and capital flight. This is, of course, is likely to strengthen privacy advocates’ already mounting criticisms of China’s social credit score model, It’s not clear that such criticism is having any influence over the government’s thinking on such matters, however. A digital RMB could even strengthen China’s influence overseas. If the One Belt One Road initiative succeeds, a digital, borderless, stable currency could facilitate international trade among its 60-plus member countries. This, coupled with the fact that China is the biggest creditor to Venezuela and it holds over 14 percent of African countries’ sovereign debt, would position it to offer a digital RMB as the next reserve currency of emerging-market economies. This would require those countries to confer to China some degree of influence over their monetary conditions. Would they prefer that to their current dependency on the U.S. Federal Reserve’s dollar? It’s an open question. But it will be highly synergetic with China’s rigorous effort of de-dollarization: reducing US dollar asset in both its foreign exchange reserve, largely increasing its gold reserve and selling off US Treasury debt. Either way, these moves could increase tensions between US and China and might even force the U.S. to pursue a similar digital model for the dollar. We still have a little time before such questions become pressing. Even so, change is coming. According to people working on this initiative, adoption will come with a great deal of observation and adjustment over the course of 10 years or more, with experiments in various use cases starting in “special economic zones” like the city of Shenzhen. Eventually, the plan is to use incentives such as increasing the transaction cost of cash to push people towards using digital currency. Cash is expected to disappear almost entirely. The next question is: what does this mean for private, decentralized cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin? It may seem incongruous that blockchain technology, initially introduced under the ethos of censorship-resistance, is now being used by central banks to further centralize their financial power. But from the perspective of the Chinese government, it’s not hard to see why. Over the long term, a digital RMB has the potential to make global trade more efficient and money laundering more difficult. Yet, given worldwide concern over surveillance by centralized institutions – both public and private – and the perennial risk that monetary policy mismanagement could foster a currency collapse akin to the Venezuelan bolivar, there’s no reason to believe such programs will kill private cryptocurrencies. On the contrary, it could boost demand for them. Anonymous, non-sovereign currencies like bitcoin or privacy coins become increasingly important in an environment where government money is closely surveilled and controlled. What’s more, a programmable fiat digital currency could provide a seamless fiat-to-crypto on-ramp. Ironically, projects such as China’s, in which governments aim to concentrate control over money, could foster greater competition from private systems of money such as bitcoin.","https://www.coindesk.com/digital-renminbi-a-fiat-coin-to-make-m0-great-again"
"Europe’s Last Push on the Iran Nuclear Deal","The Iran nuclear agreement marked its third anniversary in a gloomy state. Despite repeated attempts to keep him on board, US President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the deal – signed on July 14, 2015 under the formal title the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) – and thereby pulled the rug from under Europe’s feet. European policymakers are now focused on salvaging the agreement. For a growing number of European corporate decision-makers, the deal is already dead. In reality, the JCPOA is on life support and the next few months could open either its next or final chapter. Despite the significant challenges they face, European governments have some limited time to avert the deal’s collapse. In 2015, global powers unanimously hailed the agreement as a historic achievement that proved the effectiveness of multilateral diplomacy. Indeed, the JCPOA provides unprecedented oversight of Iran’s nuclear program . Furthermore, the agreement’s preface states that the parties anticipate it will “positively contribute to regional and international peace and security”. Many hoped that the resolution of the nuclear dispute would result in a new understanding between the West and Iran, opening a pathway for detente rather than confrontation. Relations between Europe and Iran have certainly made gains in this direction, but the Trump administration’s maximalist stance on Tehran has created an extremely hazardous environment for all remaining stakeholders in the nuclear deal. Since the formal US exit from the agreement in May this year, the Trump administration has sought to sabotage European efforts to sustain the agreement. This has involved a policy of relentlessly threatening and otherwise pressuring any country or company inclined to maintain economic channels with Iran, by weaponizing US secondary sanctions. Reportedly, the US administration recently rejected an appeal by the EU foreign ministers to negotiate broad exemptions to such sanctions for European companies. The US clearly intends to specifically target European trade with Iran – although there remain questions about its ability to do so and the reach of US enforcement. Together with its allies in the Middle East – particularly Israel, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia – the Trump administration is increasing its efforts to squeeze Iran on multiple fronts. As a new report by the European Council on Foreign Relations outlines, this anti-Iran front views the collapse of the JCPOA as the trigger for a wider policy aimed at confronting Iran. The policy seeks to cause a deep economic crisis in the country, creating domestic divisions intended to bring about regime change. As part of this, the Trump administration has signaled its willingness to go further than any previous administration by choking off Iran’s oil exports . European leaders’ have repeatedly stated their commitment to upholding the JCPOA. Policymakers are making genuine efforts to find an economic package that minimizes the impact of looming US secondary sanctions to sustain Iranian compliance with the deal. But these efforts have yet to generate an environment in which a reasonable number of European entities can make a firm commercial decision to continue doing business with Iran. Although the European Union’s leaders remain unified in their support of the JCPOA, divisions are emerging between the 28 member states over how far they are willing to test the limits of US secondary sanctions. Moreover, several proposed ideas for safeguarding European companies against extraterritorial US sanctions would require months or even years to implement, as they require alternative financial mechanisms that are ring-fenced from US exposure. European governments are also falling short in the political momentum needed to salvage the nuclear deal. For instance, Germany and the United Kingdom are now far more preoccupied with challenges at home than they were in 2015, and EU institutions are focused on averting further transatlantic divide on trade and NATO. Unsurprisingly, many European firms have little confidence that European policymakers will create the conditions necessary to protect them from US secondary sanctions, including by providing alternative mechanisms for doing business with Iran that are compliant with US sanctions. This has resulted in a wave of pre-emptive corporate over-compliance with impending US regulations and a decline in European business with Iran even before sanctions come into force. This month, the foreign ministers of France, the UK, Germany, Russia, and China (the E3+2) met with Iran to discuss political and economic pathways through which they could safeguard the JCPOA. And Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, visited Austria and Switzerland to deliver two overarching messages. The first was that Iran’s patience was wearing thin and its full compliance with the JCPOA was only feasible if it continued to receive tangible benefits from the agreement. The second was that Tehran would abandon the agreement if it became unable to maintain oil exports and, accordingly, its share in global energy markets. Rouhani’s visit followed a tense OPEC meeting, Trump’s call for Saudi Arabia to increase oil production, and weeks of speculation about the extent to which the US could pressure other countries to halt exports of Iranian oil. In Europe, Rouhani stated : “assuming that Iran could become the only oil producer unable to export its oil is a wrong assumption”. The leader of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) was quick to emphasize that elite forces were prepared to act on Rouhani’s words, noting : “we will make the enemy understand that either everyone can use the Strait of Hormuz or no one”. Iran has issued such warnings in the past, including during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war and in 2011 in advance of the EU and US embargo on Iranian oil. Iran may retaliate against any US attempts to curb its oil exports by disrupting regional crude shipments in the strait, through which 35% of all seaborne oil exports pass. Such measures seem unlikely for now – given the risk of military escalation with US and regional naval forces, and of damaging relations with China and Russia, which wish to keep energy markets stable. Rouhani’s statement suggests that Iran is hardening its position. Qassem Suleimani, commander of the IRGC’s Quds Force, unexpectedly welcomed Rouhani’s threat. Despite the significant political and economic challenges shaping Iranian domestic politics, the Trump administration’s maximalist posture may inadvertently lead to a consensus between the Rouhani government and the military elite on how to respond to national security threats. This may abruptly or gradually prompt the Iranian political establishment to shift away from diplomacy with Europe and towards confrontation with the US. Calculations on whether the JCPOA can be sustained will heavily influence this decision. Iran is likely to continue implementing the JCPOA and engaging in diplomacy with Europe for at least a few more months, as it assesses the impact of US sanctions on its economic relations with Europe, China, and India (particularly in relation to oil exports), as well as the likely trajectory of US domestic politics in the aftermath of midterm elections. Unless one side backs down, Tehran and Washington will escalate their dispute in a manner that poses real risks to European interests in non-proliferation, security in the Middle East, and global energy supply. It is imperative that in the coming weeks and months European governments redouble their efforts to sustain the nuclear agreement and ease regional tensions. Firstly, they should continue to explicitly warn the US and their partners in the Middle East that they will not support a strategy aimed at destabilizing Iran internally or pursuing regime change in the country. Such an approach risks destabilizing a country of 80 million people close to Europe’s border. At the same time, European governments should address their many areas of disagreement with Iran – most urgently, those involving regional security. As ECFR’s new report recommends, this should be done in a strategically careful manner that avoids fueling further conflict in the Middle East. Secondly, European governments must strive to fulfill their commitments under the JCPOA. They have made a good start by incorporating US secondary sanctions into the EU Blocking Regulation, due to be amended in August. But they need to quickly implement more practical solutions that will affect companies’ calculations on Iran (for a detailed list of recommendations, see the box below). Otherwise, there will be an exodus of European firms from the Iranian market. European efforts to keep Iran in the JCPOA will face major challenges, including US attempts at sabotage. The Trump administration will look to use the JCPOA as a bargaining chip in its bilateral negotiations with Europe, China, and Russia on trade policy, tariffs, and sanctions. Therefore, European leaders must make important decisions about how far they are willing to go to secure a nuclear agreement borne out of more than a decade of diplomacy. They can only do so if they act collectively and firmly. Yet they must do so to prevent escalation between the West and Iran that will have disastrous consequences for global security. Ellie Geranmayeh is a policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations based in London since October 2013. She focuses on European foreign policy in relation to Iran on the nuclear talks and wider regional issues. Ellie The Ayatollah regime has already destabilised Iran. They have brought on economic ruin. What are you talking about? Who’s side are you on? In your criticism of the Trump administration, you have ended up defending the inhuman Ayatollah regime. Try to criticize both equally. MR Mostofi who’s side are on? We all know well that you are on side of Iran enemies who have commissioned you(and many others) to comment the same tired old comment. One could understand your hostility with Ayatollahs, but you and your team mates are actually are the enemy of Iranian people lets be honest here. Anyone who’s on side of truth and Iranian people won’t go as far as facilitating an economic war on same people who you are pretending to be defending. Anyone who has a basic intelligence would understand that this warfare is only going to devastate the life for the ordinary people not the Ayatollahs but that doesn’t seem to bother you.

"Key European allies vow to uphold Iran nuclear deal after Trump reneges","Key European allies expressed grave concerns over President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw the U.S. from the Iran nuclear agreement on Tuesday, vowing to continue the work of limiting Iran's nuclear program while urging the U.S. not to jeopardize gains already made under the deal. In a joint statement issued after Trump's announcement, French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Theresa May and German Chancellor Angela Merkel implored Iran "to show restraint" following the decision and called on the U.S. "to do everything possible to preserve the gains for nuclear nonproliferation brought about by the JCPOA, by allowing for a continued enforcement of its main elements." Macron also tweeted that the three countries, America and Iran's partners in the JCPOA, or Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, "regret" the U.S. decision, adding that the nations would "work collectively on a broader framework" moving forward. Trump announced his decision to leave the JCPOA Tuesday afternoon, reneging on the landmark Obama-era accord, which also includes Russia and China, and raising the question of whether Tehran might respond by resuming its frozen weapons program. Trump also said that he would impose the "highest level" of economic sanctions, which would affect not only Iran but other countries that do business with it. In 2015, Iran agreed to halt its pursuit of nuclear weapons — and to allow international checks on its facilities — in exchange for moves by the U.S., several other countries and the United Nations to roll back sanctions that had crippled its economy. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, in a televised speech, said though America's withdrawal amounted to "psychological warfare," it would continue its talks with the remaining parties to the deal. "We've known for months that President Trump wouldn't be committed to this deal," Rouhani said. "The Iranian foreign ministry will continue talks with remaining countries in the deal." "I want to emphasize that people should not have any worries about the future of this country," he added. "The people are more united than ever, and there will be peace and stability in Iran." Syrian state media also reported that the country is standing behind Iran and condemned Trump's withdrawal, saying it "proved the U.S. is not committed to international agreements." Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has been a consistent critic of the deal, cheered Trump's decision, saying the agreement did not block Iran's path to a nuclear bomb and the current framework of the deal was a "recipe for disaster." "The deal didn't push war further away, it actually brought it closer. The deal didn't reduce Iran's aggression, it dramatically increased it," he said at a news conference Tuesday. "This is why Israel thinks that President Trump did a historic move, and this is why Israel thanks President Trump for his courageous leadership." Prince Khalid bin Salman, the Saudi ambassador to the U.S., also tweeted his support of Trump's actions, saying that the country "always had reservations" about the agreement. The United Arab Emirates' minister of state for foreign affairs, Anwar Gargash, also hailed the U.S. decision and called the agreement a "flawed deal." "The veneer of Tehran’s compliance contradicted its bellicose policies," he said in a tweet. "President Trump’s decision is the correct one." © 2019 NBC UNIVERSAL","https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/key-european-allies-vow-uphold-iran-nuclear-deal-after-trump-n872441"
"Trump’s Iran sanctions: an explainer on their impact for Europe","Ellie Geranmayeh  @EllieGeranmayeh  12th September, 2018  ECFR presents the first in a mini-series on the likely impact of US sanctions on economic ties between Europe and Iran. President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw the United States from the Iran nuclear deal has placed the European Union and the US on opposing sides of a complex sanctions framework. In recent months, the US has touted its unilateral sanctions as a powerful tool for forcing other countries to halt their business with Iran. European governments have sought to minimise the sanctions’ impact on European companies without opening a major rift in the tense transatlantic relationship. The EU, China, and Russia remain party to the deal – formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) – because it places unprecedented restrictions on Iran’s nuclear programme, thereby contributing to global security. European countries have vowed to hold the deal together (albeit by a thread) for so long as Iran adheres to its terms. Iran reaffirmed its compliance this month. To ensure that Tehran continues to keep its side of the bargain, the EU has scrambled to maintain economic ties with Iran even as a wave of European companies suspend their dealings with the country. In this series of commentaries, ECFR assesses the likely impact of US sanctions on economic ties between Europe and Iran, covering strategically important areas such as trade in essential goods, energy, and banking. The series examines how European governments can minimise the fallout of their attempts to maintain Iranian compliance with the nuclear deal. Part 1: Trump’s Iran sanctions: an explainer on their impact for Europe Part 2: Iran: The case for protecting humanitarian trade Part 3: Can Iran weather the oil-sanctions storm? Part 4: Bankless task: can Europe stay connected to Iran? Part 5: Iran oil exports: 8 waivers and the upcoming OPEC meeting Part 6: Trading with Iran via the special purpose vehicle: How it can work So far, European firms have largely complied with US secondary sanctions. It is unclear whether they will continue to do so, and to what extent, in the long term. In the coming months, the outcome of the dispute will create a precedent for transatlantic cooperation on future sanctions, and will shape other states’ perceptions of European strength and sovereignty in economic policy. Since Trump’s withdrawal from the JCPOA in May this year, American officials have travelled the world to issue an ultimatum to non-US companies: stop doing business with Iran or you will be denied access to the US market and financial sector. This threat has proved even more effective on European companies than the hefty fines they previously received for non-compliance with US sanctions on entities in Iran and Cuba. For most companies in Europe, the balance of interests is clear: their business dealings in the US, and their dependency on the US financial system, dwarf any connection with Iran. European firms that operate in non-sanctioned areas of trade with Iran or that do not rely on the US are attempting to maintain their business with Iranian entities. Nevertheless, they face numerous operational difficulties resulting from the impact of US secondary sanctions on third parties, including financial institutions and the insurance sector. European business executives often make the point that they are answerable to their shareholders and board of directors, and that European governments’ promises to shield them from US sanctions are cold comfort. During the last round of US sanctions against Iran, in place during 2010-2012, American regulators often investigated European companies. At the time, with little serious political pushback from European governments, these investigations resulted in a series of large fines on the firms. The experience had a major impact on many European companies’ calculation of risk. Under the JCPOA, the US agreed to lift some of its sanctions targeting Iran’s nuclear programme. For non-US companies, easing secondary sanctions was crucial – otherwise, they could forfeit their business in the US and face fines. In January 2016, the US rolled back some important secondary sanctions targeting Iran’s energy and banking sectors, and the EU lifted similar sanctions. These measures paved the way for European companies to re-enter the Iranian market. Shortly after Trump’s decision to withdraw from the JCPOA, the US began to reintroduce its nuclear-related secondary sanctions on Iran. The US provided companies with 90-180 days to wind down their operations related to Iran. The sanctions are being reintroduced in two waves. The first, which came on 7 August, covers commercial planes, cars, precious metals, and carpets; the Iranian government’s purchase of US dollar banknotes; and the exchange of Iranian rials (including for funds outside Iran). This wave of sanctions also applies to European companies that provide associated services, such as shipping in these sectors. Europe still needs to do much groundwork if it seeks to minimise the impact of US secondary sanctions The second wave will come on 4 November, targeting Iran’s energy, financial, insurance, shipping, and port sectors, as well as non-US financial entities’ transactions with the Central Bank of Iran and other designated Iranian banks (whose identity remains unclear). These sanctions will be particularly damaging for Iran’s economy, as they are designed to significantly reduce the oil exports the Iranian government largely depends on for revenue, and to block Iran’s access to global financial networks. It remains unclear whether the US will issue waivers and exemptions for specific countries to continue importing Iranian oil after November. In June, the US administration revoked or limited general licenses that it previously issued under the JCPOA. This includes General License H, which enabled US-owned foreign entities to engage in a range of activities involving Iran. France, Germany, and the United Kingdom have called on the US to “avoid taking action which obstructs [the JCPOA’s] full implementation by all other parties to the deal”. The Trump administration has not only ignored these calls but adopted a maximalist position on sanctions, even suggesting that European companies may come under direct sanctions if they continue to trade with Iran. In response, senior figures in Germany and France have called for measures that preserve European sovereignty in trade and foreign policy, including through the creation of payment channels that are independent of the US. Beyond all the talk, Europe still needs to do much groundwork if it seeks to minimise the impact of US secondary sanctions. It has taken some small yet tangible steps. In August, the EU revived its Blocking Regulation , first introduced in 1996, to include US secondary sanctions targeting Iran. Designed to dissuade European companies from adhering to US extraterritorial sanctions, this measure allows EU entities to recover damages arising from US sanctions through civil legal claims against “the persons causing them and nullifies the effect in the EU of any foreign court rulings based on them”. In theory, the Blocking Regulation forbids EU citizens and companies from complying with the US sanctions. In practice, given European multinationals’ ongoing retreat from Iran, there is little to indicate that the measure will have much impact unless it is fully enforced – through, for example, a legal suit in an EU court brought by a company to seek compensation for damages it has suffered as a result of US sanctions. There is very little precedent for such action. Moreover, the Blocking Regulation allows companies to apply for exemptions where they can show that ignoring US secondary sanctions would seriously damage their interests (as many could). However, the Blocking Regulation provides some legal comfort to relatively small European companies that have a limited presence in the US market. The European Commission recently earmarked €18 million of a €50 million package for projects “in support of sustainable economic and social development” in Iran, including €8 million in assistance to the private sector. This figure is incredibly low compared to the €20 billion in trade between the EU and Iran in 2017 . Nevertheless, like the Blocking Regulation, it is a noteworthy political gesture of defiance against US sanctions policy. The EU has yet to decide on critical issues such as the extent to which its banking sector will maintain links with Iran after November, as well as how it will prevent a significant reduction in Iranian oil exports. Like Japan, India, and Iraq, many European companies are engaged in talks with the US administration over how the secondary sanctions will operate, and whether the US Treasury can exempt companies in strategically important areas of trade (such as energy). European governments are also pushing for US exemptions to protect the Belgium-based SWIFT financial information service from current pressure to disconnect Iranian banks in November. During 2010-2012, the EU and the Obama administration were broadly united on their Iran policy goals and sanctions framework. They saw sanctions as a useful tool for coercing Iranian leaders into negotiations on restricting the nuclear programme. This shared perception facilitated coordination between Europe and the US on their sanctions framework and enforcement. The transatlantic political consensus allowed the long arm of US sanctions to stretch yet further into European territory. Today, European governments find themselves in a far more challenging transatlantic relationship. They have few ways to shield European companies from US sanctions and little appetite to impose the kind of substantive countermeasures that could moderate the Trump administration’s approach to sanctions enforcement, such as counter-tariffs. Europe may begrudgingly acquiesce to Washington’s position on Iran – a country in which it has a relatively small economic stake, and which it often views as a destabilising force in the Middle East. Yet if it fails to devise a more effective response to US secondary sanctions, Europe will create a long-lasting precedent for successive US administrations to control European trade and foreign policy.

"Iran’s Crypto Regulations: What’s Happening Behind Closed Doors","Under pressure for being months behind schedule, the Central Bank of Iran finally published a draft framework on the legality of cryptocurrencies in late January and welcomed feedback. While some see the totality of the framework as a step forward, most members of the burgeoning local crypto community are unhappy with much of the specifics. They feel that the framework could severely restrict people and businesses operating in the fast-growing field if it is implemented in its current form. Among other things, the framework proposes banning the use of global cryptocurrencies and various tokens as methods of domestic payment; requires cryptocurrency exchanges to obtain permits, therefore opening a new avenue for rent-seeking in a country that has already too much of it; and uses the word “forbidden” a lot, which could entail the threat of criminal prosecution. So, the local community quickly started working on ways to improve it. On March 9, more than three dozen members of the community sent their proposals to the central bank in the form of a joint document that found 51 problems in the regulator’s 13-page draft framework. However, at least for now, there isn’t much else they can do. The fate of their existing businesses, budding ideas and passion for decentralization is mostly in the hands of larger and immensely complicated centralized power structures. That this is occurring is because money has transformed into a security issue in Iran. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani’s government in early April 2018 “unified” the country’s dual foreign exchange rates in a bid to buoy a national currency sharply declining due to fears of returning U.S. sanctions. Within days, the central bank was directed to implement a blanket ban on cryptocurrencies at the behest of the government in a misguided effort to prevent further capital flight. In early May, President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers and reimposed “the toughest sanctions ever” against the Islamic Republic. This only exacerbated a currency crisis in Iran and led to the rial hitting several consecutive all-time lows in the ensuing months. Moreover, dozens of currency traders were arrested and sentenced to lengthy prison terms and hefty fines while several high-level financial offenders, including a man dubbed the “ Sultan of Coins ” due to his hoarding of gold coins, were executed. On the other hand, Iranian authorities see an opportunity in cryptocurrencies due to its potential to challenge exertion of extraterritorial restrictions. Be that as it may, people actually working on ongoing local projects know they can’t – and are not designed to – circumvent sanctions. Rouhani has personally attended several top-level meetings on cryptocurrencies, the central bank is establishing a sovereign rial-backed cryptocurrency to expand digital banking operations and Iran’s top banks have launched a gold-backed cryptocurrency to sell their bad assets and generate liquidity. Against this backdrop, any entity that has remotely anything to do with cryptocurrencies – as many as 28 – wants to have a hand in the action. After the central bank, the next major entities include the Securities and Exchange Organization, the High Council of Cyberspace, the Ministry of ICT, the parliament, the Ministry of Industry, Mine and Trade, the Ministry of Energy and the Customs Administration. It is worth noting that those entities belong to different, sometimes rivaling factions and each has their own opinions about how or whether cryptocurrencies should be regulated. In recent months, there have been talks that the cabinet may have the final say on passing cryptocurrency regulations. If that happens, it could be a simplifying factor in that it could block many of the lower-level entities from trying to have a finger in the pie. But at the same time, it chips away at the central bank’s authority and highlights the independence it so desperately needs. The fact that so many entities are trying to have a say about cryptocurrency regulations does not negate the central bank’s restrictive capabilities, but it affects its ability to legalize or otherwise support activities in this field, believes Saeed Khoshbakht , CEO of Tehran-based distributed ledger technology solutions firm Areatak. “In other words, we have one rule: everyone needs to be onboard for something to be implemented, whereas only one needs to be opposed to stop a motion,” Khoshbakht, who acted as an advisor for the central bank-affiliated Informatics Services Corporation concerning the regulatory framework, told CoinDesk. He thinks Iran’s cryptocurrency community needs to learn to lobby – “in its positive sense” – since it currently has no effective links to any of the deciding entities. That, he said, could include working toward enacting constructive regulations, alleviating concerns felt by law enforcement and judiciary, and supporting government entities when necessary. “Ultimately, I believe the central bank is Iran’s best bet for regulating cryptocurrencies,” Khoshbakht said. “If making decisions for this area gets out of the central bank’s hands for any reason, including mistakes on the community’s part, I think the situation could become much more difficult.”","https://www.coindesk.com/irans-crypto-regulations-whats-happening-behind-closed-doors"
"Two Nuclear Deals, Two Countries, Three Decades Apart","Does the failed nuclear agreement with North Korea have lessons for the Iran deal? President Trump is expected this week to decline to certify that Iran is in compliance with the nuclear deal formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. The deal’s supporters have warned that such a move could eventually prompt Iran to abandon the multilateral agreement and continue work on its nuclear program, which was frozen under the pact. The U.S. has been in a similar spot before: In 1994, the Clinton administration signed the U.S.-North Korean Agreed Framework, under which Pyongyang agreed to freeze its nuclear program. The Bush administration withdrew from the deal after accusing North Korea of cheating on its obligations. After that, North Korea restarted a nuclear-weapons program that, according to various estimates, has now yielded between 20 and 60 bombs; the country is close to fitting a miniaturized nuclear warhead onto an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the contiguous United States. The ultimate failure of the Agreed Framework is cited by both critics and supporters of the Iran deal to bolster their case for why the U.S. should leave, or remain in, the JCPOA. Critics of the JCPOA say it is as flawed a deal as the Agreed Framework, and that neither Iran nor North Korea can be trusted to keep its word. Supporters of the Iran deal concede it is flawed but argue that in the short term it achieves its objective of freezing Iran’s nuclear program. According to this line of argument, moreover, maintaining the Agreed Framework with North Korea would have left Pyongyang with much less advanced weapons capabilities today—and conversely, the Trump administration’s approach to the JCPOA could persuade Iran to follow the blueprint laid out by North Korea. On the face of it, the two agreements have much in common. Each focused exclusively on the nuclear activities of a country whose other problematic behavior was not part of the deal. They froze the programs in exchange for economic and other incentives. And, says William Perry, the Clinton-era defense secretary who is now an advocate for nuclear disarmament and who helped negotiate the Agreed Framework, both agreements were “designed to head off a future nuclear catastrophe.” “They both were agreements designed to head off [North Korea and Iran] … from building a nuclear weapon, which we believed would cause enormous difficulties for the United States,” Perry told me, adding: “If we keep them from doing that, this is a way of heading off that difficulty.” But there are significant differences as well. For one, the Agreed Framework was a bilateral agreement between the U.S. and North Korea. The JCPOA is a multilateral agreement that also involves China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, Germany, and the European Union. (The other signatories, including Iran, say they will remain in the deal and are urging the U.S. to stay.) Second, as Richard Nephew, a senior research scholar at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University, and Newell Highsmith, a former State Department official, wrote in April for the Brookings Institution, Iran is not North Korea. It doesn’t have nuclear weapons. At the time the Agreed Framework was concluded, North Korea was believed to possess enough plutonium for at least one bomb. Tehran, Nephew and Highsmith argued, has greater incentive to cooperate with the JCPOA because it “is not the isolated ... country that North Korea is. Iran’s economy needs markets for oil exports, and depends on imports of commercial and industrial goods.” The JCPOA is also a much more comprehensive deal than the Agreed Framework, with more intense monitoring mechanisms to ensure compliance, and clear consequences , in the form of renewed sanctions, for cheating. Additionally, under the JCPOA, Iran agreed to indefinite compliance with the additional protocol of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, a move that opens up even its military facilities for international inspection. The Agreed Framework did not have such safeguards in place, which can partly explain why its critics call it a failure (though nonproliferation experts such as Jeffrey Lewis make a strong argument for why that’s not the case). Ultimately, the U.S. withdrew from the Agreed Framework citing instances of North Korean cheating—though the U.S. also failed to fulfill some terms of the deal before withdrawing. U.S. partners in the JCPOA argue that while Iran’s regional activities are a problem, Tehran’s compliance with the agreement has been verified multiple times by rigorous international inspections. As Perry put it, if Trump takes the first step to pull out of the JCPOA, “quite aside from the international diplomatic problem of having the United States make an international agreement in good faith and then, without any apparent reason, back out of it a year or two later … the second problem is [that] … as we pull out of it, it allows … Iran [to] go ahead with a nuclear program.” He added: “Every agreement doesn't cover all problems we have. … Because we cannot solve all problems doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try to solve some problems. Of the problems we have with Iran, in my judgment, the nuclear problem is the most serious.” That’s also true of North Korea today. The Trump administration—if not the president—is hoping to persuade Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear and missile programs through diplomacy. Defenders of the Iran deal point out that taking a step that could ultimately spell the JCPOA’s demise would send a bad signal to North Korea: that the U.S. cannot be trusted to keep its word. But Perry, who negotiated closely with his North Korean counterparts in the 1990s, said he wasn’t persuaded by that argument because “North Korea in many ways is an enigma.” “I think they are careful observers of what's going on in other countries, for sure,” he said. “But I do believe they have a different calculus for how they make their diplomatic decisions, which may or may not involve their reflection on what’s happening with other agreements.” We want to hear what you think about this article.

"Iran lists demands for staying in nuclear deal","Officials say EU must present credible package by end of May to compensate for US sanctions  Patrick Wintour Diplomatic editor  Fri 25 May 2018 11.39 BST   Last modified on Tue 7 Aug 2018 15.33 BST   Iran has said it will decide in the next few weeks whether to pull out of the nuclear deal signed in 2015 and start enriching uranium capable of making a nuclear bomb. The announcement was made by Tehran as its officials met counterparts from France, Britain, Germany Russian and China in Vienna on Friday to assess how the deal can be kept alive in the face of the reimposition by the US of secondary sanctions designed to cripple any European firm continuing to do business with Iran. President Trump withdrew from the deal despite strenuous European objections on 8 May, adding that old sanctions against contact with the Tehran regime would be reimposed. In the run-up to the Vienna meeting, Tehran officials said the EU would need to present a credible compensation package by the end of the month to make up for the loss of income to Iran caused by the US sanctions. Afterwards, Iran’s deputy foreign minister Abbas Araqchi said he was more confident than before that the deal could survive. “For the time being we are negotiating... to see if they can provide us with a package which can actually give Iran the benefits of sanctions-lifting and then the next step is to find guarantees for that package and we need both legal and political commitments by the remaining participants in the JCPOA [deal],” he said. In July 2015, Iran and a six-nation negotiating group reached a landmark agreement known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action that ended a 12-year deadlock over Tehran’s nuclear programme. The deal, struck in Vienna after nearly two years of intensive talks, limited the Iranian programme, to reassure the rest of the world that it cannot develop nuclear weapons, in return for sanctions relief. At its core, the JCPOA is a straightforward bargain: Iran’s acceptance of strict limits on its nuclear programme in return for an escape from the sanctions that grew up around its economy over a decade prior to the accord. Under the deal, Iran unplugged two-thirds of its centrifuges, shipped out 98% of its enriched uranium and filled its plutonium production reactor with concrete. Tehran also accepted extensive monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which has verified 10 times since the agreement, and as recently as February, that Tehran has complied with its terms. In return, all nuclear-related sanctions were lifted in January 2016 , reconnecting Iran to global markets. The six major powers involved in the nuclear talks with Iran were in a group known as the P5+1: the UN security council’s five permanent members – China, France, Russia, the UK and the US – and Germany. The nuclear deal is also enshrined in a UN security council resolution that incorporated it into international law. The 15 members of the council at the time unanimously endorsed the agreement. Iran is increasingly sceptical that Europe has the means or will to set up an economic firewall that can assure European firms that they will be protected from US Treasury fines if they do business in Iran. Many of the firms trading with Iran, such as the French oil company Total, have substantial US interests and do not want to put those assets at risk to continue trading with Iran. The Vienna meeting being held in the joint commission format was the first such conference without the US, and was in some ways a test of Europe’s commercial and diplomatic ability to follow a foreign policy independent of Washington. Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei this week said his country would stay in the deal on three strict conditions. He said the EU had to protect Iranian oil sales from US sanctions and continued to buy Iranian oil. He also demanded European banks safeguard trade with Iran, including by keeping the country inside the Swift international payments system. Finally, he also urged France, Germany and the UK not to seek a new agreement on Iran’s ballistic missile programme, or its regional activities, including its presence in Yemen, Iraq and Syria. Broadly, Russia and China agree with these terms. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, on Monday outlined a counter set of demands before the country would rejoin the deal that the EU rejected as unrealistic and amounting to regime change in Tehran. The EU fears ever heavier economic sanctions will strengthen hardliners in Tehran, while the US believes a country-wide rebellion can be stoked among a population angry at the regime’s costly overseas military adventures. Speaking in St Petersburg, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, said the US approach to the deal was “not serious”, adding he was comforted by a report from the International Atomic Energy Agency confirming Iran was still abiding by the deal’s key restrictions on its nuclear facilities. He also said companies from France and other European countries should be given an opportunity to “keep their economic profit, despite the US sanctions, and maintain their economic presence in Iran”. Macron added: “Europe should have a stronger economic sovereignty. France envisages a compensation for French companies acting within the framework of treaties signed by France.” The EU is studying three plans to protect trade with Iran – a legally untested blocking statute that renders any US sanctions on EU companies null and void, euro-denominated finance for companies from the European Investment Bank, and an EU equivalent to the US Treasury’s secondary sanctions regime. Macron also said he wanted Iran to complete the nuclear deal by signing a new framework agreement to cover ballistic missiles and its regional activities. He revealed he had spoken to Tehran on the need to agree on what follows the end of the agreement in 2025. It is not clear what the EU will do if Iran pushes back on this plan. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, counselled against anything that resembled reopening the deal, and warned of the lamentable consequences if the deal collapsed. There is intense anger in some European capitals, notably Paris, at the unilateral tone of the US approach, especially the reimposition of sanctions. The premise of the nuclear deal – officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action was to let Iran rejoin the global economy in exchange for denuclearisation. The only EU country so far to support the US withdrawal from the deal is Poland. The most effective weapon in the US economic armoury is to slash Iranian oil exports by isolating Iran’s central bank from the global banking system. About 37% of Iran’s oil exports go to European destinations, and overall the EU is Iran’s number one trading partner. The value of trade between the EU and Iran soared from $9.2bn (£6.9bn) in 2015 to $25bn in 2017.","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/25/iran-lists-demands-nuclear-deal-eu-us-sanctions"
"Secrecy News","The US is no longer complying with the Iran nuclear deal and is poised to re-impose some previously lifted sanctions on Iran and its trading partners. But the legal basis for that action is a bit murky and contested. A new analysis from the Congressional Research Service tries to make legal sense of what has happened. “The legal framework for withdrawal from an international pact depends on, among other features, the type of pact at issue and whether withdrawal is analyzed under domestic law or international law,” the report says.

"Follow B&B","asdasdasdasdasdasdasdasdasdasd For decades, Iranians have had to contend with almost complete isolation from international payment systems due to US sanctions. The situation has only worsened following President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal and embark on a “maximum pressure” campaign that targets average Iranians. Given these restrictions on traditional banking, it should come as little surprise that Iran is home to a vibrant and passionate cryptocurrency community. Iranians are increasingly turning to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to transact with the outside world. Soheil Nikzad, a board member of the Iran Blockchain Community, recently estimated that USD 10 million worth of bitcoin transactions are conducted in Iran on a daily basis. The decentralized and anonymous nature of cryptocurrency payments means that the Iranian government has so far proven unable to stop adoption of the new technology. But regulators are trying to exert greater control as made clear when the Central Bank of Iran (CBI) published its draft regulatory framework on cryptocurrencies in late January. The “version 0.0” framework asserts that “using global cryptocurrencies as methods of payment inside the country is forbidden.” Even though the framework recognizes global cryptocurrencies and allows them to be traded in official exchanges in accordance with the country’s foreign currency rules , the proposed ban on their use for payments has disappointed many in the local “crypto” community. “I don’t view CBI’s framework as remotely adequate because they’ve forbidden many things and in doing so, they’ve created barriers for people trying to develop valuable projects,” blockchain researcher Hamid Babalhavaeji told Bourse & Bazaar , referring to CBI’s ban on the issuance of rial-backed tokens as an example. Babalhavaeji’s frustration is shared by many in the community. Twitter feeds and Telegram channels are abuzz with debates and sharp criticism of the CBI framework. But there are nuances at play. “Within the existing legal frameworks, including sensitive rules concerning foreign currencies and money laundering, it was perhaps the best that could be proposed at the moment,” Babalhavaeji acknowledged. In this vein, many in the community believe it would be unproductive to simply dismiss the proposed framework as just another instance of overbearing regulations. The community understands the pressures faced by the government, which is grappling with what senior Iranian officials have referred to as an “economic war” being waged on Iran by the U.S. Reimposed US sanctions have contributed to the rial losing more than 60 percent of its value in 2018. Naturally, at a time when public trust in the national currency is at a low, CBI wishes to keep a tight leash on the currency markets. Authorizing several dozen global cryptocurrencies as methods of payment inside the country, some of which are pegged to global currencies, could further weaken the rial, threatening the livelihoods of millions of Iranians as inflation worsens due to currency volatility. On one hand, businesses would be tempted to establish payment gateways to accept cryptocurrencies pegged to the US dollar or other stable globally currencies. As wealthier Iranians begin to earn and spend cryptocurrencies, those in the working class, still paid in rials, would see their meager wages lose even more purchasing power. On the other hand, fully eliminating the prospect of using global cryptocurrencies as a local method of payment could hurt Iran in other ways. It would create a stigma around a promising new technology, stalling innovation and deterring would-be enthusiasts from employing cryptocurrencies to meet Iran’s need for robust and legitimate payment solutions. The central bank has given the community one month to offer feedback and has vowed to review and reevaluate its framework in six-months. The crypto community is hard at work trying to devise practical solutions. One proposal would see cryptocurrency payments connected to the rial, meaning that certified gateways would accept cryptocurrency payments, but the actual clearance would be made in rials. Another proposal would see the payments cleared using Iran’s forthcoming official rial-backed cryptocurrency . Community members aim to arrive at a consensus soon, which they will present to the central bank. “At the end of the day, it’s about coming up with creative ideas to make the best out of a restrictive framework. We don’t want to create any potential legal challenges for the central bank,” Babalhavaeji said. Despite the payments dilemma, some have welcomed CBI’s draft framework as a step forward. The proposed regulations recognize cryptocurrency mining as a legitimate industry, authorize digital wallets and cryptocurrency exchanges, and allow issuance of tokens that are not backed by rials, foreign currencies, or gold and other precious metals. Furthermore, the new framework is slated to replace the blanket ban on cryptocurrencies that was issued in April 2018 in the early days of the currency crisis. “In 2017 when cryptocurrency prices were soaring and new investors were pouring into markets, strange rumors circulated that purchasing and holding cryptocurrencies is illegal in Iran and at times the central bank would be referenced as the source,” explained Tina Kheiri, a young crypto and blockchain educator with Iran Blockchain Academy. “At least people active in this field now have the reassurance that their activities don’t violate any laws, and this alone should encourage more newcomers to enter the industry,” she added. But Kheiri also believes the proposed framework ought to be more flexible. She would like to see more straightforward initial coin offerings (ICOs) for businesses and greater use of cryptocurrencies for routine transactions—such as when selling tickets for her courses. Kheiri also thinks she might have a solution for the threat posed by cryptocurrencies to Iran’s currency markets. “Boosting the mining industry could encourage major players to invest in Iran due to its cheap electricity, something that could actually attract foreign currencies and increase the value of the rial,” she explained. The community is not short of innovative ideas, but it remains to be seen whether it will achieve a policy breakthrough with the central bank.

"European SPV Offers Lifeline to Iran and the JCPOA","Three European nations scrambling to salvage the Iran nuclear deal (the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action or JCPOA) announced on January 29 the formation of a new “special purpose vehicle” (SPV) to preserve their commercial ties with Iran in spite of U.S. banking sanctions. France, Germany, and the United Kingdom—three of the JCPOA’s original seven signatories, along with China, Iran, Russia, and the United States—unveiled the SPV, or the “Instrument in Support of Trade Exchanges” (INSTEX)—which will allow Iran to barter for European goods in transactions that steer clear of financial networks and do not rely on the U.S. dollar. European leaders trumpeted INSTEX as a sign that they remain invested in the nuclear deal’s survival. UK Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt called it “a clear, practical demonstration that we remain firmly committed” to the JCPOA. European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini issued a statement welcoming the formation of the SPV, arguing that the new instrument “will provide economic operators with the necessary framework to pursue legitimate trade with Iran.” However, what the Europeans announced on Thursday was not what they described when they began talking about forming an SPV last year . At that time, the SPV was envisioned as a much larger financial mechanism that could allow Iran to continue selling oil and gas to Europe with minimal disruption. But major European firms, worried about even the possibility of running afoul of U.S. sanctions, have cut ties with Iran, and it seems unlikely that any degree of assurance from the EU would be enough to get them to risk losing access to U.S. banks and the U.S. market. Consequently, INSTEX is likely to be a much less ambitious device, used primarily by small European firms with little exposure to U.S. sanctions and only—at least initially—to trade in humanitarian goods like medicine and food. U.S. sanctions do not directly block Iran’s import of these items, so by focusing on them INSTEX would avoid a potential confrontation with Washington. But banking sanctions generally prevent Iranian firms from financing their purchase, and so INSTEX could fill an important role in easing the pain those sanctions are causing to the Iranian people. In a press call held by the European Leadership Network (ELN) on January 29, Bourse & Bazaar founder Esfandyar Batmanghelidj explained the benefit the new mechanism could provide to Iranians struggling to obtain basic necessities: And what that means is that even compliance trade, meaning trade that’s exempt from U.S. secondary sanctions, such as trade in food and medicine, has been negatively impacted, and these are two categories that are really important for the Europe-Iran trade relationship.  So, for example, Europe exports around 800 million euros of pharmaceuticals and medical devices to Iran every year, and by comparison, China exports just around 200 million euros worth. So, the relationship with Europe is really key in these categories, and as you can imagine, these are goods that have a really big impact on sort of quality of life and well-being in Iran. These are goods that the households in Iran really depend on, whether it’s consumer goods or medicine or food products. So, the role of the SPV is to try and retain a reasonable volume of trade or basically mitigate the negative impact on this trade from the U.S. secondary sanctions. Also this week, the International Atomic Energy Agency reiterated that Iran is complying with its obligations under the JCPOA. But since the United States violated the agreement last year by re-imposing sanctions, Iranian leaders have insisted that they will not remain party to the agreement unless they receive its promised economic benefits. The re-imposition of U.S. sanctions has probably made that impossible, but the Iranians still may be made to feel that they have more to gain by remaining in the JCPOA than by leaving it and restarting an industrial-scale nuclear program. Will this pared-down SPV be enough to satisfy Iranian leaders? Iran’s deputy foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, welcomed the INSTEX announcement as “the first step within the set of commitments the Europeans have made to Iran,” but pointedly did not go any further than that. On the ELN press call, Tarja Cronberg, the former chair of the European Parliament’s Delegation with Iran, called INSTEX “an effective response” to Iran’s demands that “will take sort of the heat off…at least for the time being” in terms of quieting the demands of Iranian hardliners to quit the JCPOA. U.S. reaction to INSTEX has been relatively muted so far. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo criticized the idea of the SPV when it was initially discussed, but that was before its scope was reduced. About INSTEX, the State Department merely said that it is “closely following reports about the SPV to gain additional details about the mechanism” and that it does “not expect the SPV will in any way impact our maximum economic pressure campaign” against Iran. Indeed, as long as it stays focused on ensuring that Iranians can get access to basic goods like food and medicine, INSTEX could actually bolster the Trump administration’s claims that its sanctions are not meant to punish the Iranian people. INSTEX hasn’t been entirely well-received in DC, especially within the regime-change echo chamber. Mark Dubowitz, CEO of the hawkish Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, tweeted somewhat colorfully that “Trump administration must neutralize this trade channel before it becomes the camel’s nose under the tent. Don’t be misled by need for a humanitarian channel; multiple such channels already exist given escrow funds + Iran banks on Swift.” INSTEX’s farthest-reaching impact may not directly relate to Iran at all. Although its scope is small and explicitly designed to minimize confrontation with the United States, it nevertheless reflects a growing interest in Europe to insulate European interests from broad U.S. sanctions. That could have major ramifications for the efficacy of future U.S. sanctions, as ELN Policy Fellow Axel Hellman explained: The last point I’d like to make on this is just to kind of look at this from an American perspective. What we can say is that what has enabled the United States to use economic and financial sanctions so effectively is the power position that United States has, the centrality of U.S. capital markets in international finance, the importance on the U.S. dollar as a tool for clearing international transactions, and the buy-in from allies to U.S. policy when it has leveraged that strength to impose sanctions. That is, for instance, what we saw on the international sanctions regime on Iran leading up to the nuclear deal.  So, the growing concern now in the United States—among some people, I should mention—is that when you now have a situation where you first don’t have that active buy-in from allies you have the other key players—Russia, China, and, of course, the European Union—disagreeing with U.S. policy over Iran and remaining in the nuclear deal, but also actively trying to set up alternative structures such as the SPV. The risk to the U.S. position is that over time this will lead to a degradation of U.S. ability to use sanctions the way that it has been recently. U.S. foreign policy has become increasingly reliant on sanctions as a tool for throwing Washington’s weight around short of open military conflict. But it’s a tool that will lose its effectiveness the more it is overused, as even U.S. allies are driven to find ways to protect themselves from those penalties. INSTEX does not appear to be comprehensive enough to seriously challenge the potency of U.S. sanctions. But, to borrow Dubowitz’s phrase, it could be the “camel’s nose under the tent” for a much bigger challenge to Washington’s influence. Derek Davison is a Washington-based researcher and writer on international affairs and American politics. He has Master's degrees in Middle East Studies from the University of Chicago, where he specialized in Iranian history and policy, and in Public Policy and Management from Carnegie Mellon University, where he studied American foreign policy and Russian/Cold War history. He previously worked in the Persian Gulf for The RAND Corporation. It is very naive to think that secular Iranians will get any business done with the outside world. Only Ayatollah businesses will benefit from this. They will literally set up hundreds of tiny proxy companies to bypass the sanctions. Europe knows this and is colluding with inhumane Ayatollahs. Question is, whether helping Ayatollahs is the same as helping secular Iranians? If you are outside Iran, like me, you are seen by anti-Shah activists as an enemy. If you are anti-US, you are seen as pro-Ayatollah. These two camps have created an atmosphere that has produced a 40 year political deadlock. Iran’s future is in the hands of its people who are stuck in a never ending political name-calling, obscene and very rude personal attacks, that have plagued the various opposition groups, and have benefited those who hate Iranian culture. If you don’t believe me read the reactions to this post and my previous posts. There is a reason I post here. It is to prove that Iranians cannot discuss controversial political discussions in a civil manner. Ali Mostofi speak for your self! You are a pro-Shah & MEK and against the Ayatollahs and the interests of the people, period. We don’t like Ayatollahs either but we have the interests of the people at heart and will never join the freaking Pahlavi or MEK against the people of Iran. So stop showing off as if you’re anti-Ayatollahs! You do have a hidden agenda and you are like an open book being pro-Pahlavi and MEK. Mostofi, from your very first post on Lobelog that you call love for the Iranians that you haven’t been in touch for 40 years, you have managed to systematically insult every single author of this site with your very limited ayatollah scope and a fifth grader vocabulary. And of course it hasn’t allowed for a single discussion to develop. How’s that possible that you haven’t been able to connect with one person here, author or reader ? maybe it’s time to move on and spare us the so called your reason to be here. I looked up Ali Mostowfi- he is the son of Bagher Mostowfi who ran Iran’s petrochemical industry and was accountable to the king and British Prime Minister Anthony Eden. A true Iranian patriot who worked for the British and helped with the coup d’etat that restored the King and got us into all this mess. So his bitterness is quite understandable as he comments on his face book page that his dad found oil in Iran and never made a dime of it. The king did reward him and his dad quite handsomely off the books. He should be an Iran hater since he is no longer in the privileged class. @JackSpade, What you said is all true and well said.  Unfortunately Ali’s dad was our big boss as the ceo of the Iranian petrochemical co reporting directly to Shah! Fortunately left them in 1971. In addition to your comment Bagher’s family are descendants of Mostofi-aldoleh or they’re ghajaries  and blood related to Shah’s mother whom was a ghajarie as well. As you may know ghajarieh dynasty has been and sill is the darkest chapter in history of Persia and 2nd to the Pahlavi dynasty! They sold all the northern states to Russia for pennies in order to satisfy their addiction to opium! Glad that those corrupt families are decimated or near extinction!

"Trump chastises intel chiefs after they contradict him on Iran and claims of foreign policy success","Updated 1653 GMT (0053 HKT) January 30, 2019 Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump chastised his own intelligence officials Wednesday morning for being soft on Iran a day after they contradicted numerous administration claims of foreign policy success. The Intelligence people seem to be extremely passive and naive when it comes to the dangers of Iran. They are wrong! When I became President Iran was making trouble all over the Middle East, and beyond. Since ending the terrible Iran Nuclear Deal, they are MUCH different, but.... ....a source of potential danger and conflict. They are testing Rockets (last week) and more, and are coming very close to the edge. There economy is now crashing, which is the only thing holding them back. Be careful of Iran. Perhaps Intelligence should go back to school! When I became President, ISIS was out of control in Syria & running rampant. Since then tremendous progress made, especially over last 5 weeks. Caliphate will soon be destroyed, unthinkable two years ago. Negotiating are proceeding well in Afghanistan after 18 years of fighting.. ....Fighting continues but the people of Afghanistan want peace in this never ending war. We will soon see if talks will be successful? North Korea relationship is best it has ever been with U.S. No testing, getting remains, hostages returned. Decent chance of Denuclearization... ...Time will tell what will happen with North Korea, but at the end of the previous administration, relationship was horrendous and very bad things were about to happen. Now a whole different story. I look forward to seeing Kim Jong Un shortly. Progress being made-big difference!

"How Iran Will Determine the Nuclear Deal's Fate","ARIANE M. TABATABAI is Director of Curriculum and a Visiting Assistant Professor at Georgetown University’s Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service in the Security Studies Program and an International Security Program Fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs. When U.S. President Donald Trump announced on May 8 that he was pulling the United States out of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), commonly known as the Iran nuclear deal , many observers promptly turned their attention to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to ascertain the future of the agreement. Since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, conventional wisdom has held that decision-making power ultimately rests with the supreme leader. Hence, with every major event in Iranian public life and foreign affairs, commentators take to the pages of newspapers and magazines to predict Khamenei’s reaction, ponder the significance of his statements, decipher his comments, and determine what it all means for the fate of the country and its place in the world. More often than not, however, the supreme leader’s statements create a framework for the country’s foreign policy rather than the precise road map that it must follow. And in creating this framework, the final arbiter of Iranian affairs is supported by hundreds of staffers and advisers. Because the Islamic Republic is a notoriously opaque system, it makes sense that many Western observers often credit the two most visible power centers of the regime with making national security and foreign policy decisions: the supreme leader and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). In reality, the decision-making process is not a simple top-down exercise but the result of a complex push and pull within a web of organizations, some of which are redundant. This is because as a revolutionary state, the Islamic Republic relies on a number of coup-proofing mechanisms to safeguard the regime. Competition between these institutions and infighting within the different factions that constitute them often dominate the decision-making process. HOW TEHRAN CREATES POLICY The supreme leader’s role lies in creating the framework within which other organizations will operate. Advised by a team of staffers, he determines the redlines and bottom lines of the country’s policies, zones of possible agreement in negotiations, and acceptable and Loading, please wait...

"Trump’s Iran Policy Is ‘Untethered to History’","Interview:  Trump’s Iran Policy Is ‘Untethered to History’  Trump’s Iran Policy Is ‘Untethered to...  Foreign Policy:  Your book argues for the urgent need to “renew diplomacy.” Who is your target audience for this plea? As far out as I can see into the 21st century, I think the utility and the significance of diplomacy is only going to rise. I worry about its drift, which predates the Trump administration. It didn ’ t start at the beginning of 2017, but I do think it has accelerated and gotten infinitely worse over the last couple years. FP:  In your book, you wrote that diplomacy is misunderstood, unheroic, and “less swaggering than unrelenting.” Trump’s Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has famously vowed to restore the department’s “swagger.” Was your word choice purposeful here? Do you think Pompeo is indeed restoring the department’s swagger? FP: Turning to Russia, there seems to be this fixation on Vladimir Putin himself, especially in D.C., especially now. What was it like for you dealing with Putin himself? Do you think the United States and Russia will ever be able to forge a better relationship with Putin in power? FP:  You mentioned in your book there are certain hinge points in history. In hindsight, was there any hinge point in the U.S.-Russia relationship where it all went so wrong ,and could the United States have done anything to avert it? Or do you think this adversarial relationship we see today was inevitable? FP:  This month marks the 16th anniversary of the Iraq War. You described in one chapter in vivid detail how you and other U.S. officials tried and failed to slow walk the U.S. invasion of Iraq. Now, 16 years later, do you feel the U.S. foreign-policy establishment has adequately learned its lessons? FP: One unnamed colleague you quoted on this time period said: “There ’ s honor in continuing to serve so long as you ’ re honest about your dissent. But you never entirely escape the feeling that you ’ re also an enabler.” This quote seems very relevant today, with some civil servants struggling with carrying out some of the administration’s more controversial policies. How do diplomats who might oppose a president ’ s policies on a practical or moral level reconcile this? FP: You do highlight one significant success during that time beyond Iraq: The diplomatic work you and others did to get Libyan leader Muammar al-Qaddafi to give up his weapons of mass destruction program. Do you think there are any lessons from this work you did for the Trump administration today given its negotiations with North Korea? FP: Five Democratic presidential candidates have come out and said that they would re-enter the United States into the Iran nuclear deal if they were elected. Do you think the Iran deal can survive a one-term or two-term Trump presidency? What type would a new administration need to do to bring the U.S. back into the deal? FP:  Turning to Benghazi, you wrote, “Legitimate questions about what more we should have done on security were wrapped up in a set of investigations and hearings that were astonishingly cynical, even by the standards of modern Washington.” The current secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, made his political name first as a junior Kansas congressman through leading the charge on the Benghazi hearings. How do you square that with where he sits in Foggy Bottom today? Can you separate Pompeo the congressman from Pompeo the secretary of state now? FP: A recent U.S. Government Accountability Office report found that chronic staff shortages across the department undermine security for diplomats overseas. Has Washington adequately learned the lessons from Benghazi in terms of ensuring embassies ’ and diplomats ’ safety? FP: You referred to the Trump administration ’ s approach to the State Department as a “profoundly self-destructive shock and awe campaign against professional diplomacy.” Why do you phrase it like that? Do you think this “campaign” is still underway, and what type of impact will it have on U.S. foreign policy? FP: But you and Tillerson both agree that the department is sorely in need of reform. What are some specific and tangible reforms you would undertake at the department to help restore it? WB: As an institution, the State Department is rarely accused of being too agile or too full of initiative.  We’ve tended over recent decades, much like painting and repainting the walls of your house, to add layer after layer of bureaucracy to the department. We’ve become top-heavy. We’ve tended to beat down initiative in the system. So if you’re the desk officer for Jordan and you write a memo and are offering a recommendation, you’re now going have 19 other people that are going to fiddle, not with just your language, but also with the nature of your recommendation. Then you’re going to feel less sense of ownership in either the argument or the prose. FP:  Your book also warns of the “ militarization of diplomacy.” What does that mean, and why is it so dangerous for American foreign policy? Robbie Gramer is a diplomacy and national security reporter at Foreign Policy . Twitter: @RobbieGramer Trending Now Sponsored Links by Taboola More from Foreign Policy Tehran’s military is advancing ever farther into outer space—and the threat is bigger than Washington is letting on. The U.S. president’s 2020 budget request is especially harsh on the U.N. and refugees.

"Donald Trump plans a nuclear arms race in his State of the Union","The important stories of innovation across the continent’s wide-ranging economies In-depth coverage of the world’s largest democracy for India and its far-flung diaspora Lifestyle, culture, and living well in the new global economy Management news, advice, and ideas for business leaders Create, share, and discover charts, using the same tools as the Quartz newsroom Donald Trump’s nuclear diplomacy was on full display in his State of the Union speech on Tuesday, which included the revelation of an upcoming meeting between Trump and North Korean strongman Kim Jong Un in Vietnam on February 27 and 28. Contemplating his recent decision to withdraw the US from the Intermediate Nuclear Forces treaty with Russia, Trump mused that “perhaps we can negotiate a different agreement, adding China and others, or perhaps we can’t—in which case, we will outspend and out-innovate all others by far.” A plan to spend more money on new nuclear weapons than US rivals has another name—a nuclear arms race. Trump’s aides, particularly national security adviser John Bolton, are long-time critics of international negotiations to reduce nuclear stockpiles. Many arms control experts fear that the ultimate target of their efforts is a treaty that limits long-range nuclear missiles, called New START , which remains the last global limit on nuclear arms standing. In contrast, the INF treaty limited land-based medium-range nuclear ballistic missiles during the Cold War. In recent years, Russia has been violating the treaty by developing these weapons, thought the US had also technically done so by moving a sea-launched missile system, Aegis, on-shore. Despite Russian violations, arms control experts argue pulling out of the treaty is strategically unwise. While Russian can use its medium-range land-based missiles to threaten Europe, the US cannot use them to threaten Russia unless it bases them in foreign countries—and few countries are crying out for US nuclear weapons. Thus, in the words of US Naval War College professor Tom Nichols, “we’re letting the Russians bait us into a nuclear standoff that benefits them, because of the home turf advantage.” “I think this is opening the door to an all-out arms race,” an arms control official who worked for president Barack Obama told Foreign Policy . China, which has large missile stockpiles but relatively few nuclear warheads, may see the crumbling of nuclear treaties as a signal to start increasing their stockpiles. In 2018, the US withdrew from a nuclear deal with Iran, which US intelligence agencies believe delayed Iran’s ability to obtain a nuclear weapon. In his speech, Trump argued that the US put in place “the toughest sanctions ever imposed on a country,” which isn’t true—while the US has increased its sanctions on Iran, the rest of the world has not, even setting up an experimental special-purpose vehicle to facilitate trade outside US control. The deal now hangs in the balance, with the rest of the world apparently attempting to wait out the Trump administration in the hopes that the framework can be restored sometime in 2021. When it comes to nuclear diplomacy with North Korea, Trump is right that the country has not launched a missile in 15 months and it has stopped nuclear testing—after a surge in launches at the start of his term brought the US to the negotiating table and led Trump to cancel US military exercises with South Korea. Now, it’s not clear what Trump is prepared to offer Kim in return for North Korean denuclearization, and what Kim would accept, given Trump’s willingness to abandon deals at his convenience. But the summit may be at least an admission of one reality: Trump’s 2018 claim that there “is no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea” was not true.","https://qz.com/1543693/donald-trump-plans-a-nuclear-arms-race-in-his-sotu-speech/"

Donald Trump’s all-caps harangue yesterday addressed at Iranian president Hassan Rouhani was unusually strident, even for him. It appeared at first to be a response to a speech by Rouhani, who warned against a US attack on Iran during remarks of his own in Tehran. But it’s worth remembering how Trump sees Iran: Past statements reveal that the US president considers America’s relationship to the country as a useful tool for political misdirection. In 2012, for instance, Trump appeared convinced that Barack Obama would strike Iran in order to boost his popularity ahead of that year’s presidential election. Despite Trump’s predictions, Obama did not attack Iran. Instead, he led world powers to ink a deal with Iran that restricted its ability to produce weapons of mass destruction while lifting harsh economic sanctions. In May, Trump pulled the US out of that agreement. Iran has since begun laying the groundwork to resume production of the radioactive fuel needed to create nuclear weapons. Though European nations are trying to keep the deal’s framework in place, they face difficulties doing so in because of resumed US sanctions . And with Iran’s economy slumping, Rouhani now has incentives to focus his constituents on an abstract foreign enemy. So does Trump. Days before Trump’s Iran tweet, the Department of Justice released to the public a old redacted request to wiretap one of his presidential campaign advisers. National security law experts say the legal documents show compelling probable cause to suspect his advisor, Carter Page, was working for a foreign country. This undermines Trump’s argument that investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election are frivolous or partisan. The day after Trump’s tweet, even more information become public: Twelve audio recordings made by Trump’s personal attorney, Michael Cohen, became available to prosecutors investigating allegations of financial wrong-doing. And five witnesses were granted immunity to testify against Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, who is facing charges of bank fraud and conspiracy. The same day as Trump’s tweet, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also delivered a harsh public indictment of Iran’s leadership, accusing them of using government power to enrich themselves. “The level of corruption and wealth among Iranian leaders shows that Iran is run by something that resembles the mafia more than a government,” Pompeo said. But it’s hard to see how much credence this message will be given on the international stage. Multiple  members  of  Trump’s  own cabinet face ethics investigations. The special counsel inquiry into Trump’s election has so far has led to eight guilty pleas, two convictions and multiple indictments. And the president himself has not released his tax returns or divested himself from his private company, which continues to profit from government business.","https://qz.com/1334536/donald-trump-already-told-us-why-hes-shouting-at-iran/"
"Follow B&B","asdasdasdasdasdasdasdasdasdasd The European Union and its member states have been scrambling to to preserve the economic benefits of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) for Iran following President Trump’s withdrawal from the agreement on May 8. In the last month, the European Commission has moved to add Iran to the investment mandate of the European Investment Bank (EIB), the EU’s long-term lending institution (even in the face of significant resistance from EIB’s management). Similarly, the European Commission’s Directorate-General for International Cooperation and Development (DEVCO) has set-aside a pool of funding to support projects in Iran. The European External Action Service is also coordinating discussions around central bank payment channels and the European Commission’s revival of the blocking regulation , which prohibits European compliance with extraterritorial sanctions. As a core party to the JCPOA, the UK government has a strong interest in seeing these European efforts succeed. However, in March of 2019, at the end of the Brexit process, the UK will likely leave the EU, meaning that it will end its participation as stakeholder in European institutions, including EIB, as well as European legal frameworks, such as the blocking regulation. While the Bank of England is exploring the creation of payment channels with the Central Bank of Iran, the UK government has shown little real initiative to match European efforts to sustain economic engagement with Iran. In recent weeks, Iranian authorities have indicated that they believe bilateral efforts will prove the most successful in delivering solutions to protect trade and investment in the face of US secondary sanctions. Countries like France, Germany, Austria, Italy and Sweden have been exploring whether it may be possible to use state investment vehicles and financial institutions to facilitate investments to Iran. The UK has not, pointing to the EIB's expanded mandate. But given that EIB is unlikely to finance projects in Iran, and given that the UK is set to exit the EU anyway, the UK government can no longer lean on European efforts in devising an economic package for Iran. To demonstrate its commitment to the JCPOA, the UK should parallelize its Iran policy with that of EU member states and seek its own mechanisms through which to support access to financing in Iran’s economy—both because of the clear national security implications of maintaining the the nuclear deal, but also to take advantage of economic opportunities in a major emerging market, particularly one in which UK companies can continue to make inroads from a low base of activity. The reimposition of US sanctions means that the UK government cannot reasonably rely on British private sector financiers to engage in project finance in Iran. Just as European governments are exploring state-owned entities through which to provide financing, so will the UK financing entity need to be state owned. Helpfully, such an institution exists. CDC Group is the overseas investment arm of the UK government. The group is a state-owned development bank overseen by the Department for International Development. It currently overseas an investment portfolio of around GBP 5 billion and primarily funds projects in Africa and South Asia, with a strong focus in countries where were formerly part of the British Empire and now part of the Commonwealth. CDC has a wide portfolio of investments in infrastructure, health, manufacturing, food and agriculture, and construction. The investment philosophy is focused on “sectors where growth leads to jobs” and the institutions “decision-making process ranks sectors based on their likelihood of creating jobs.” Investments take the form of both equity and debt financing. On the basis of its focus on emerging markets and its investment philosophy focused on job creation, there is justification for the UK government to extend the investment mandate of CDC Group to include projects in Iran. Such a move would parallel the EU’s attempted move in regards to EIB and the still planned funding via DEVCO, as well as the various efforts at the member-state level. If CDC’s investment mandate is extended to Iran, the challenge will be to ensure that the relevant capital can be deployed in Iran. For this purpose, the UK government should seek to use the UK-regulated branches of Iranian financial institutions. These institutions will be able to maintain correspondent banking relationships with their Iranian parent banks in the face of US sanctions. If the UK government can institute additional due diligence protocols around the transfer of funds via this channel, it should be possible to deploy capital in Iran without the need to rely on the UK’s tier one banks. Importantly, in order to encourage the UK to make such a move, the Iranian government must be prepared to offer a privileged pipeline of investment opportunities to CDC Group, particularly with regard to public-private partnership projects in Iran that would include the participation of UK multinationals or SMEs. For example, CDC Group financing could help support the strong inroads made by UK solar energy developers in the Iranian market. Furthermore, the Iranian government should explore export credit or sovereign guarantee arrangements that would project CDC Group’s investments in order to lower the assessed risk behind a given project in Iran. The Iranian government should actively seek a UK commitment to facilitate development financing in Iran. Politically, such a move would be consistent with the ambitions of “Brexit Britain” as the UK will need to replace its reliance on EU institutions in regards to engaging global growth through proactive investments. As with bilateral relations with other European countries, an expansion in economic engagement could reduce pressure on political relations. The UK will no doubt expect to see progress on its consular cases as part of trust-building and the deepening of ties with Iran. Beyond challenges of structuring, the continued political uncertainty in the UK, including the recent change in foreign minister, will make such plans complicated to execute. But Iran can leverage its relationships with key stakeholders within the Foreign and Commonwealth Office as well as in the House of Parliament and House of Lords in order to seek a structured dialogue on this matter. Whether through CDC Group or another special purpose vehicle, Brexit Britain should be pushed to at least match EU proposals to support trade and investment in Iran, and thereby to safeguard the nuclear deal.

"Europe faces a choice over Iran: uphold its values or surrender its credibility | View","Share this article The withdrawal of the United States from the Iran nuclear deal framework – known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) – between Iran and the EU/E3+3, and the myopic support for this action received from some regional actors, has potential far-reaching consequences for international peace and security. Europe cannot allow the genie of reckless unilateralism to be unleashed. Since its withdrawal, the hawkish US administration is unremitting in trying to completely shut down the JCPOA, a goal which lies at the heart of its so-called grand strategy on Iran. The fruition of years of intense multilateral diplomacy is now on critical life support. Without effective and timely intervention, the JCPOA will simply die. Farcically, the agreement may expire, exactly because it has worked so well, mainly due to Iran’s faithful compliance and restraint. In fact, the Trump administration was in violation of the terms of the deal since its first day in office. The Office for Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) of the US Treasury Department did not issue a single license; instead, it advised extra due diligence. The ill-intentioned tenor of recurrent uncertainties hindered major businesses and banks from engaging with Iran. To be clear, the US unilateral withdrawal on its own does not kill the JCPOA. However, what does cause even greater alarm is that the party in defiance seeks to also extend its dominance to the Europe and other participants of the agreement. What steps should be taken, in particular by the Europe, to save the patient? First, the principle of international multilateralism must be emphatically reaffirmed. For many historical, political and economic reasons, multilateralism remains core to Europe’s identity and cohesion. The withdrawal from the JCPOA is at the height of Trump’s vociferous assault on multilateralism. Following scrapping the Paris Agreement and moving the US Embassy to Jerusalem, he is now up to a full-fledged trade war, to name a few. Europe cannot allow the genie of reckless unilateralism to be unleashed. Second, Europe must act according to its core values. Ever since the Marshall Plan, transatlantic ties have been a key force of Europe’s trajectory. The US withdrawal from the JCPOA has massively contributed to an unprecedented rift in transatlantic relations. Europe, however, appeared to try to ‘manage’ or ‘tame’ Trump. This approach proved to be futile, as the US President has seldom changed his stance due to consultation with allies in Europe. Even as Europe continues to think strategically and act according to its core values, the reality and magnitude of the damage President Trump inflicts might well lead to irreversible damage. The increasingly volatile situation in the Middle East is only one such example. Europe is faced with a choice. If Europe chooses, during the Trump Administration, to give priority to the transatlantic ties, it risks running against its very own principles and values, and only undermines its sovereignty and credibility. Third, Europe and the remaining parties to the JCPOA must act to preserve the integrity of international law and of the UN. The deal was sealed and became part of international law by the UN Security Council Resolution 2231. Trump’s zeal to nullify Obama’s legacy comes at the cost of undermining the very principle of state responsibility in public international law. Fourth, Europe must highlight the strategic value of the JCPOA for international and regional peace and security. President Trump does not seem to comprehend that killing JCPOA is to the detriment of security for everyone. Policies of bullying and intimidation only increase the likelihood of dangerous counter measures, with the potential to spiral into uncontrollable conflict. The JCPOA, in particular, continues to generate a momentum for engagement and dialogue towards defusing tensions in the Middle East. Europe and other remaining signatories should not give in to policies that are injurious for regional and international peace and security. Fifth, JCPOA’s non-proliferation clause must be upheld. Practically, through the most stringent verification regime in its history, the IAEA has confirmed Iran’s compliance with the JCPOA on eleven separate occasions. Pushing a successful non-proliferation regime towards economic collapse can only lead to disaster. Such actions simply encourage disengagement and, moreover, undermine the credibility and core competencies of the nuclear watchdog, the IAEA. For strategic reasons, Europe and the remaining signatories need to preserve the non-proliferation prominence of the agreement. Sixth, Europe needs to acknowledge and reward Iran’s compliance with the agreement. Iran has been the complaint, not the violator. JCPOA can survive without the singular party in withdrawal, but it cannot endure without Iran. Rather, it is Iran’s trust which needs to be regained. Expressions of commitment are essential and in place. This needs, however, to be complemented by deliverable guarantees of Iranian economic gain, as warranted under JCPOA, and will now require extra and time-bound efforts by Europe and the remaining agreement parties. Iran’s self-restraint to date should not be misinterpreted. Iran cannot be expected to implement an unbalanced deal. In the absence of concrete guarantees and reassurances from Europe and the remaining participants, upon its ongoing preparations, Iran has no choice but to explore its own options to act in accordance to its national interests. The JCPOA is a strategic stabilizer for regional and international peace. But to rescue and preserve its existence, Europe and the remaining signatories must choose cohesive and timely action.

"On speaking terms: Europe-Iran dialogue on regional flashpoints","Over the past fifteen years, Europeans have been perfecting the art of engaging the Islamic Republic of Iran against the backdrop of adverse conditions. In 2003, France, Germany, and the UK, later joined by the EU High Representative (E3/EU) Javier Solana , intercepted Iran’s willingness to open negotiations over its controversial nuclear programme at a time the Bush Administration was adamantly opposed to talks. Eventually, the E3/EU’s initiative paid off, as it provided the avenue for the Security Council to agree on a combination of dialogue and sanctions to approach the Iranian nuclear issue. It was in an expanded E3/EU+3 framework (with the US, China and Russia joining the E3/EU) that the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the Iran nuclear deal, was eventually concluded in July 2015. The latest iteration of European Iran crisis management formats is a group comprised of the E3, the EU External Action Service (EEAS) and Italy (hence, E4/EU), which for a year has been having talks with Iran over Middle Eastern crises, most notably the war in Yemen. As was the case with the E3/EU in 2003-4, the E4/EU’s action is unfolding in an extremely challenging environment. Iran’s activities in the region – notably its support for Shia groups in Iraq, President Bashar al-Assad in Syria, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and the Huthi rebels in Yemen – have won it a degree of influence that is deeply worrying to its rivals, namely Israel, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Most importantly, the Trump Administration has explicitly mentioned Iran’s “destabilising” role in the region as one of the reasons underlying its decision to renege on its commitments under the JCPOA and re-impose sanctions. Thus, Europeans are once again reaching out to Iranians at a time of mounting tensions between the Islamic Republic and the US. An optimist would look at the E3/EU action on the nuclear issue as an encouraging precedent proving that persevering in engagement can eventually help create the conditions for major diplomatic breakthroughs. A realist would point to background conditions that make it unlikely for the E4/EU to repeat the E3/EU’s achievements. The nuclear issue was nightmarishly complicated in technical terms, but politically it was rather straightforward: the point was to provide for verifiable guarantees of the peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear programme. This was a goal both Iran and the E3/EU+3 could subscribe to, with the bone of contention being what such guarantees would be. The JCPOA ostensibly solved the issue. The equivalent to the nuclear deal on a regional level however – a grand bargain providing for regional security governance – is not in the cards given rising animosity between Iran and its foes. Against this backdrop of increasing conflict, the scope of the exchanges between the E4/EU and Iran is inevitably rather limited. For a start, the exercise is about dialogue, not negotiation. Europe, after all, has little to offer as it only plays a marginal role in the flashpoints in which Iran is a main actor. But the E4/EU and Iran have had their own interest in avoiding framing their exchanges as negotiations. The initiative was conceived in early 2018 after President Trump had made clear he was ready to quit the JCPOA unless the Europeans did more to address his concerns, including more forcefully confronting Iran in the region. The E3 sounded out Iran about its availability to set up a parallel track where they could discuss sensitive matters. The E3 hoped that President Trump would appreciate Europe’s willingness to act upon his concerns and desist from his intention of leaving the nuclear deal. For Iran, it was critical to avoid the perception that they were engaging in negotiations that could lead to concessions to keep the US in an agreement they were abiding by. They agreed to open “political consultations” exclusively on regional issues, but also expressed their preference for an expanded format comprised of the E3 – which the Iranians considered too prone to accommodate US objectives – as well as the EEAS and Italy, perceived as favouring a more balanced approach. This format was also seen as a stronger guarantee that the dialogue would continue even if the US left the JCPOA, as it eventually did. The E4/EU and Iran held their first meeting during the Munich Security Conference in February 2018. They have since met three more times, once in Rome in May and twice in Brussels in September and December 2018. The exchanges, held at the level of political directors (deputy foreign minister for Iran), usually last for no more than half a day and with the EEAS performing chairmanship duties. There is no fixed schedule, with the parties meeting on an ad hoc basis (no date for a fifth meeting has been set). Thus far, Yemen has been the only topic discussed with some depth, although Syria was briefly covered in the last meeting. Given their technical nature and narrow agenda, E4/EU-Iran exchanges have unsurprisingly had a minimal practical impact. However, it would be unwise to dismiss the exercise as futile. The E4/EU-Iran dialogue has provided for the only Yemen-related diplomatic platform involving Iran, despite the fact that Tehran’s support for the Huthis makes it a party in the conflict. E4 officials maintain that engagement has helped to consolidate Iranian support for the UN special envoy for Yemen. Iran’s attitude has played a part in persuading the Huthis to agree to a prisoner swap and further steps that would demilitarise the section of Yemen’s Red Sea coast where the majority of humanitarian assistance lands. While these steps – collectively known as the Stockholm Agreement – have so far largely remained on paper, they remain the only shared terms of reference for both the Huthis and the internationally recognised Yemeni government (and the Saudi-UAE coalition that is waging war on its behalf). The E4/EU-Iran dialogue can help clarify what actions can realistically be taken to bring forward implementation of the agreement, which the Huthis cannot afford to ignore if Iran throws its weight behind it. Ideally, the dialogue could perform a similar function of ‘forging consensus’ on limited matters on other issues, starting with Syria. The E4/EU format has greater potential than meets the eye. One of the main advantages of the E3/EU’s action on the nuclear file was that it worked as a catalyst for EU consensus, which proved critical to undermine divisive tactics by Iran and mitigate US demands for action the Europeans considered excessively tough or at least premature. The E4/EU could generate convergence dynamics within the EU over Iran’s regional role. The E3’s recent tendency to move closer to the US-promoted narrative of Iran as the ultimate source of regional instability – through its support for proxies but also the development of its ballistic missiles – would be offset by the conviction by other European players that recreating a stronger basis of trust in Europe-Iran relations is critical. The EEAS, Italy, but also Austria and Spain have been instrumental in rephrasing a recent statement by the European Council so that it expressed concern over Iran’s activities on the ballistic front, in the region and in Europe (where it stands accused of planning assassination plots against dissidents) while also advocating a “balanced” approach, including dialogue. The E4/EU could provide for a close-knit format where EU differences could be resolved on a regular basis rather than just in occasion of Council meetings. Critically, it would reduce the vulnerability of individual EU countries to pressure from the US. Washington’s request to Poland to co-host a conference on the Middle East where it hoped to get support for its policy of maximum pressure over Iran is a case in point. The fact that EU countries responded coldly to the initiative – even Poland made it clear it continued to support the JCPOA – point to an existing intra-EU consensus over Iran, which the E4/EU could help shape into policy positions. A first step involves establishing follow-up mechanisms that ensure homogeneity in the relaying of messages that the E4/EU hear from the Iranians to other critical players within the EU, across the Atlantic and in the region. The importance of the E4/EU-Iran dialogue lies less in what it produces in terms of concrete actions than in the fact that the process exists. With the JCPOA on life support and the US and its regional allies – Israel, Saudi Arabia and the UAE – bent on exerting maximum pressure, the Europeans have a desperate need for keeping all channels of communication open. As with other initiatives – the E3/EU’s continued engagement in the JCPOA Joint Commission on the nuclear front and the creation of the INSTEX Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) to protect E3-Iran trade from US sanctions – the point of the E4/EU is to persuade the Iranian leadership that diplomacy may be effective in resisting isolation. An E4/EU that gradually morphs into a shaper of EU joint positions could greatly help in this regard, in that it would keep the Europeans focused on their priorities, namely avoiding steps that could undermine their efforts at saving the nuclear deal and bring about a total breakdown in relations.

"Iranian president travels to Austria in effort to salvage Iran deal","Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Wednesday that Iran would remain in a landmark nuclear deal with world powers, despite the withdrawal of the United States — but only if other countries can "guarantee Iran's interests." Rouhani's comments came as he met with top-ranking Austrian officials in Vienna, where the nuclear deal was finalized in 2015, in an effort to preserve the pact after President Trump Donald John Trump The Hill's Morning Report - White House, Congress: Urgency of now around budget  GOP presses Trump to make a deal on spending  Democrats wary of handing Trump a win on infrastructure  MORE announced in May that he would abandon it. "Iran will protect the nuclear deal if it can benefit from it," Rouhani said at a joint news conference with Austrian President Alexander Van der Bellen, according to the Iranian president's office . "But this must be balanced and if signatories other than the U.S. can guarantee Iran's interests, Iran will stay in the deal without the U.S.," he added. Rouhani and other Iranian officials, concerned about the re-implementation of U.S. sanctions, are locked in an intense effort to convince world powers to remain in the 2015 agreement — officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif is set to meet with counterparts from the five other countries in the nuclear deal — the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia and China — on Friday in a bid to save the deal, which sought to curb Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief from the U.S. and others. The pact was seen as one of former President Obama's key foreign policy achievements. But Trump had long railed against the JCPOA as a diplomatic and national security failure, because it focused on Iran's nuclear ambitions without addressing other activities, like Tehran's backing of groups deemed terrorist organizations by the U.S. Since Trump's announcement of the U.S. withdrawal in May, his administration has sought to reimpose sanctions on Iran and has encouraged other countries to do the same. The U.S. is also pressing allies to cut out Iranian oil imports entirely by Nov. 4. Trump's withdrawal from the deal, however, was widely rebuked, even by allies in Europe who see the JCPOA as the framework for curbing Iran's nuclear program. Van der Bellen stood by the deal after his meeting with Rouhani on Wednesday. "Austria and the European Union are ready to maintain and deepen the framework for cooperation with Iran," he said, according to Bloomberg News .

"","January 12, 2019  Topics    ap photo/oded balilty    US National Security Advisor John Bolton, left, speaks to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a joint statement to the media follow their meeting, in Jerusalem, Sunday, Jan. 6, 2019. January 12, 2019    There’s no evidence behind the national security adviser’s dire warnings about Tehran’s nuclear intentions.    Here’s the dire warning National Security Advisor John Bolton brought Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Jan. 6: “We have little doubt that Iran’s leadership is still strategically committed to achieving deliverable nuclear weapons.” I have found zero evidence to support Bolton’s claim. It is unclear who “we” means, but it certainly does not include the American intelligence community. They have found exactly the opposite. While it is currently trendy to fact-check Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, allow me to suggest that it matters more — a lot more —when  statements made by the national security advisor are untrue. This four-Pinocchio claim is a true whopper and has serious national security implications. Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats certainly does not agree with Bolton. He testified to the Senate last year that Iran “wants to preserve the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action” which expressly forbids Iran from ever having nuclear weapons. He said that the accord “has also enhanced the transparency of Iran’s nuclear activities, mainly by fostering improved access to Iranian nuclear facilities.” That is, we have increased our already formidable ability to detect any Iran violations. The International Atomic Energy Agency concludes , and U.S. intelligence agencies agree, that Iran remains in strict compliance with the deal that shrank and then largely froze its nuclear complex.  Subscribe  Subscribe to the Defense One daily. Be the first to receive updates. In his 2017 statement, “ Worldwide Threat Assessment of the US Intelligence Community ,” Coats was crystal clear on the issue of intent: “We do not know whether Iran will eventually decide to build nuclear weapons.” That is, Bolton has no basis for his statement. “We” — the U.S. intelligence agencies—do not believe that Iran is committed to building nuclear weapons. Nor is this a new judgement, one that Bolton might have somehow missed in the press of his duties. Paul Kerr, in his comprehensive 2018 report for the Congressional Research Service, finds: “Since at least 2007, the U.S. intelligence community has issued unclassified assessments that Iran has not decided whether to develop nuclear weapons. According to the 2007 NIE , ‘Iranian military entities were working under government direction to develop nuclear weapons’ until fall 2003, after which Iran halted its nuclear weapons program ‘primarily in response to international pressure.’” These political intentions are important because Iran clearly has the industrial and technological basis to build at least first-generation nuclear weapons. It is not clear whether Iran has mastered all the techniques for an advanced weapon or has the design for such a weapon. But there is little doubt that it eventually could build them, should it embark on a crash effort. It is the political decision not to do so that prevents their production. If Bolton’s claim were true, then Iran might break out of its nuclearagreement at any minute and race to a bomb. We’d be on hair-trigger alert in the region. We might have to take military action to destroy Iran’s remaining nuclear infrastructure before they surprised us with a bomb. Or as Bolton pithily put it in his 2015 oped , “to stop Iran’s bomb, bomb Iran.” I have no idea where Bolton is getting the intelligence to support this claim. Even the much-ballyhooed documents stolen from the so-called Atomic Warehouse by Israeli agents only show that Iran had the framework for a nuclear weapons program in place by 2003, but not that they ever did much beyond vague plans. The intelligence community stands by its assessment that Iran abandoned the program in 2003. “There is literally nothing new here,” said Jeffrey Lewis, a weapons expert who examined the documents. NBC News reported that “Lewis’ view was echoed by American intelligence officials, who told NBC News that while the documents may contain new details, the story they tell — that Iran once had an unauthorized nuclear program — is an old one.” We may be uncertain how much knowledge the Iranians retain about weapon construction 16 years later, but the Iran anti-nuclear deal was constructed on a worst-case assessment, according to Stephen Mull, who led the U.S. effort to implement the agreement. “We built this deal in a way that it rested on what we can measure and verify,” he said in 2016 . “How much fissile material is there? How big is Iran’s enrichment capacity? Does the international community through the IAEA have the capability to investigate any suspicious activity anywhere in the country?” and so forth. So what explains Bolton’s bizarre claim? Is he learning from his boss, copying President Trump’s practice of lying about even the most obvious and provable facts ? Bolton’s deceptions predate Trump. He honed the technique in the run-up to the invasion of Iraq, when he engaged in a systematic effort to subvert the intelligence on Iraqi programs and bury any evidence contrary to his claims, including: “We are confident that Saddam Hussein has hidden WMD and production facilities.” (No, we weren’t and no, he didn’t.) As Peter Beinart notes , to read Bolton’s columns and speeches over the past two decades “is to enter a cocoon. His writing is filled with assertions—about the purity of America’s intentions, the motivations of its adversaries, the uselessness of diplomacy, and the efficacy of war—for which he offers either feeble evidence or no evidence at all.” A survey of Bolton’s former colleagues by ProPublica concluded that he skews intelligence, that he “resists input that doesn’t fit his biases and retaliates against people he disagrees with.” In short, we have a national security advisor whose temperament and tendencies nearly exactly mirror those of the president — an exceptionally dangerous situation. Trump’s mendacity may encourage Bolton’s, but he needs precious little prompting. As the secretary of state continues this week and next on his overlapping anti-Iran tour of the Middle East, we should brace for a stream of false claims every bit as strong as the ones coming from the White House. In particular, we should spend at least as much time fact-checking their claims as we do those of the youngest member of Congress, whose exaggerations may prove embarrassing, but are unlikely to be fatal. Bolton’s and Pompeo’s falsehoods are paving the way for a Middle East war that will make the dispute over the wall with Mexico look like a border dust-up.

"EU determined to preserve Iran nuclear deal after US pulls out","An Iranian woman walks past a mural on the wall of the former US embassy in the Iranian capital Tehran on Tuesday. Photo/ AFP PHOTO / ATTA KENAREATTA KENARE/AFP/Getty Images US president Donald Trump holds up a national security  memorandum on Iran that pulls the US out of the  nuclear deal. Photograph: EPA “The deal with Iran is the culmination of 12 years of diplomacy,” EU high representative for foreign affairs Federica Mogherini said on Tuesday night in response to the US decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal. “ It belongs to the entire international community . . . The EU is determined to preserve it.” Ms Mogherini, who was a facilitator of the Iran agreement and chairs the joint committee that oversees it, echoed sentiments from many of the EU’s capitals in expressing a determination to keep the deal still working, and sent a strong signal that the union would not adhere to sanctions proposed by president Donald Trump. The EU is determined to persuade Iran that the agreement can survive US repudiation. The five powers that brokered the deal – China , France , Germany , Russia and the United Kingdom – along with the EU all said they regretted the decision on Tuesday night, reiterating their commitment to the deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). In a joint statement on Tuesday evening, British prime minister Theresa May, France’s president Emmanuel Macron and German chancellor Angela Merkel emphasised their continuing commitment to deal, saying it remained important for our shared security. “This resolution remains the binding international legal framework for the resolution of the dispute about the Iranian nuclear programme. We urge all sides to remain committed to its full implementation and to act in a spirit of responsibility.” The statement noted that, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Iran continues to abide by the restrictions set out in the deal. Statement on the Iran Nuclear Deal: https://t.co/O3SpryCKkc Mr Macron also tweeted to warn that the US withdrawal was putting the international nuclear non-proliferation regime at stake. EU leaders will have been particularly alarmed by Mr Trump saying “any nation that helps Iran could also face sanctions”, a clear suggestion that EU companies may face difficulties if they continue doing business there. The ultimatum, a demand that allies fall into line, could cause a considerable rift between the US and EU. Earlier, a spokeswoman for the European Commission insisted the EU will continue to implement the agreement. She reiterated that the IAEA had carried out 10 inspections and had found no significant violations by the Iranians. “It’s quite clear that we believe that the agreement is working and our commitment to continue with implementation remains,” the spokeswoman, Maja Kocijancic, said, adding: “We believe that the agreement should be preserved.” The EU, she said, was “working on plans to protect European companies” that might face US sanctions for continuing to trade with Iran. In increasingly desperate attempts to dissuade Mr Trump from abandoning the JCPOA, EU leaders, most recently Mr Macron and Dr Merkel, have flown to Washington to argue with the president that far from going soft on Iran, they are determined to take it to task over its ballistic missile programme and its military activities in Syria and Yemen . That can best be done, they argued, by maintaining the JCPOA. On Tuesday in Brussels , officials from the EU, France, Germany and UK met a delegation of Iranian officials led by the deputy foreign minister for political affairs, Abbas Araghchi . There have been reports that Iran may be willing to maintain the deal as long as the EU, Russia and China are prepared to defy the US by continuing to trade with Tehran. Russia and China issued a joint statement on Friday declaring their “unwavering support for the comprehensive and effective implementation” of the deal and citing “the urgent necessity for all parties to the JCPOA to rigorously adhere to and fully implement their commitments”.

"UN Security Council to meet over Iran ballistic missile test","The UN Security Council will meet behind closed doors on Tuesday at the request of France and Britain after they accused Iran of test-firing a medium-range missile at the weekend, diplomats said. The United States said the missile launch on Saturday was a violation of a UN resolution that endorsed the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, from which Washington has withdrawn. That resolution calls on Iran to refrain from testing missiles capable of carrying a nuclear weapon. France said it was concerned by the test-firing with the foreign ministry describing it as "provocative and destabilising", adding that it "does not conform" with UN resolution 2231 on the Iran deal. British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt called the missile test "provocative, threatening and inconsistent" with the resolution and said Britain was determined "that it should cease". Over the weekend, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo charged that Iran tested a medium-range missile capable of carrying multiple warheads and striking parts of Europe and the entire Middle East, a claim that was denied by Iranian officials. Pompeo said the test violated UN Security Council Resolution 2231, which endorsed the 2015 nuclear deal signed by several world powers and Iran. The US pulled out of that deal in May, pitting Washington against several of its key European allies, who have sought to maintain the agreement in the face of heated rhetoric between the Donald Trump administration and Tehran, and the reinstatement of US sanctions on Tehran last month. Washington's Iran special envoy Brian Hook insisted on Monday that despite Iran's assertions to the contrary, Iranian missile tests were not defensive in nature. "We would like to see the European Union move sanctions that target Iran's missile programme," Hook told reporters aboard Pompeo's plane as he travelled to Brussels for a NATO meeting. In Paris, the French foreign ministry also said the missile test was not in compliance with the UN resolution. France "calls on Iran to immediately cease all activity linked to ballistic missiles conceived to carry nuclear weapons, including all launches using ballistic missile technology," it said. For its part, Iran said Sunday it would continue missile tests to build up its defences and denied it was in breach of UN resolutions. "Missile tests ... are carried out for defence and the country's deterrence, and we will continue this," Brigadier-General Abolfazl Shekarchi, spokesman for Iran's armed forces, was quoted as saying by the semi-official Tasnim news agency. "We will continue to both develop and test missiles. This is outside the framework of [nuclear] negotiations and part of our national security, for which we will not ask any country's permission," Shekarchi said. He did not confirm or deny Iran had tested a new missile, Reuters news agency reported. The alleged test comes amid heightened US pressure on Iran, as well as repeated attempts by US officials to persuade its European allies to stop doing business with Tehran in line with renewed US sanctions on the country, which came into force on 4 November. Those US sanctions have targeted Iran's critical oil sector, as well as several major Iranian banks and other industries. On Monday, Hook said Trump's campaign of "maximum pressure" on Tehran since withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal "can be effective if more nations can join us in those [sanctions]". "It is a grave and escalating threat, and nations around the world, not just Europe, need to do everything they can to be targeting Iran's missile program," he said. Hook said "progress" was being made on getting NATO allies to consider a proposal to target individuals and entities that play key roles in Iran's missile programme. Several EU countries have denounced the recent US sanctions, however, and continue to work to preserve the 2015 nuclear deal, even though they have also criticised Iranian positions on other matters. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a staunch opponent of Iran, welcomed Pompeo's request to sanction Iran's missile programme on Monday. "I want to thank you for everything that you're doing, for your strong statements on the latest violation by Iran on the ballistic missiles," said Netanyahu, ahead of a planned meeting with Pompeo in Brussels. On Monday, Iran's oil minister, Bijan Zanganeh, said Tehran aims to help regular Iranians cope with the economic problems created by US pressure. “The goal of America and its regional allies is, through exerting pressure and economic shortages, to say we have hit a dead end on the threshold of the 40th anniversary of the Islamic revolution,” said Zanganeh, as reported by Reuters, citing the oil ministry news agency SHANA. “We have a legal and religious duty to reduce the income pressure on the people. This is the most important thing that we must do and the government is putting forth all its efforts on this issue."  View the discussion thread.  © Middle East Eye 2019 - all rights reserved.

"Trump Hates International Treaties. His Latest Target: A Nuclear-Weapons Deal With Russia.","The next casualty of President Trump’s suspicion of multilateral deals could be a 30-year-old arms accord with Russia. When Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev solemnly signed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty at the White House, the leaders of the world’s superpowers hailed the transition from an era of “mounting risk of nuclear war” to one marked by the “demilitarization of human life.” But when Donald Trump unceremoniously declared the treaty dead over the weekend, the mood was different. After taking a shot at Barack Obama for not pulling out of the agreement in response to Russian violations, the president complained about how unfair it is that Russia and China get to “do weapons” that “we’re not allowed to,” and boasted of the hundreds of billions of dollars the U.S. military could “play with” were it to build new nuclear weapons of its own. The demilitarization of human life this was not. The Trump administration has yet to formally withdraw from the INF Treaty, but if the president makes good on his pledge, the move would be massively significant. Here’s why. For decades during the Cold War, the United States was obsessed with defending the homeland against the Soviet Union’s nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles. But by the late 1970s, it confronted a new threat from the Soviet nuclear arsenal: the deployment of shorter-range ballistic missiles capable of targeting America’s NATO allies with little advance notice. The United States responded with what the inexorable logic of the Cold War demanded: stationing similar missiles, capable of striking the Soviet Union, in Western Europe. But it simultaneously pursued negotiations that culminated in a 1987 agreement between Reagan and Gorbachev. The INF Treaty required the United States and the Soviet Union to permanently eliminate all ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with a range of 500 to 5,500 kilometers—the types of weapons systems, numbering in the thousands, that precipitated the showdown in Europe. In effect, it eliminated an entire class of nuclear weapons. Along with the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, which drastically reduced the number of long-range Soviet and American nuclear weapons, it was critical in ending the nuclear-arms race. The United States and Russia have for years been trading accusations that the other party is violating the INF Treaty (Russia purportedly with a banned cruise missile; the U.S. allegedly with its missile-defense systems in eastern Europe). But they have persisted with the agreement. Less than a year ago, the Trump administration unveiled a strategy of sticking with the INF while pressuring Russia into compliance through a mix of diplomacy, sanctions, and talk of researching and developing prohibited weapons systems of its own if necessary. As recently as this summer, Jon Huntsman, the U.S. ambassador to Russia, was still describing the INF to reporters as “probably the most successful treaty in [the] history of arms control.” What’s changed is that National-Security Adviser John Bolton now appears to have “the president’s ear on this issue,” Kingston Reif, the director of disarmament and threat-reduction policy at the Arms Control Association, a nonpartisan organization that seeks to raise awareness about arms-control efforts, told me. Bolton, a proto–America Firster who joined the Trump administration in the spring, has long opposed international arms-control and nuclear-nonproliferation agreements that he claims are utterly ineffectual or intolerable infringements on the United States’ freedom of action. During the George W. Bush administration, he helped engineer the U.S. withdrawal from a treaty with Russia limiting antiballistic-missile systems and an agreement with North Korea rolling back its nuclear program, and he championed Washington’s exit from the Iran nuclear deal under Trump. In 2011, well before the United States was calling out Russia for violating the INF, Bolton argued for either bringing new countries into the treaty or scrapping the accord entirely, since it constrained America’s ability to counter rival nuclear powers like China and nuclear aspirants like Iran and North Korea. (Even without its own intermediate-range missiles near China, Iran, and North Korea, the United States can still deter these countries with other elements of its nuclear-weapons arsenal, such as nuclear-capable aircraft and submarines.) Trump has made a strikingly similar case—condemning the treaty for rendering the United States shackled and outgunned by a resurgent Russia and rising China, even as he floats the idea of one day reviving and expanding the agreement to include other nuclear-armed states. Richard Burt, who helped negotiate the INF Treaty during the Reagan administration, said that while he’d “love to believe that this is a very clever strategy to get leverage over the Russians” and compel them to adhere to the terms of the treaty, he seriously doubts it. Instead, he thinks Trump’s decision is an effort to shake off restraints and assert unfettered American sovereignty—just as the administration has done by withdrawing from the Paris climate pact and trade agreements. History teaches that leaders only agree to reduce their stockpiles of nuclear weapons when they improve relations with adversaries and no longer fear the types of war they once did, the nuclear-weapons expert George Perkovich once told me. If that’s the case, however, the inverse is also true: When the ranks of adversaries swell and the specter of war looms large, nuclear buildups are a natural temptation. Trump’s intention to quit the INF and his hesitancy to renew another Obama-era nuclear-arms-control accord with Russia are in one sense symptoms of just how fierce competition between the world’s great powers has become. In walking away from the treaty, the president is recognizing a “changed reality” in both technological and strategic terms, Bolton declared on Tuesday during a visit to Russia. Burt, who is now a managing partner at the firm McLarty Associates, predicted that a U.S. withdrawal from the INF Treaty would prompt Russia to again deploy intermediate-range missiles and the United States to react by rolling out new sea- and air-based weapons systems even if it doesn’t redeploy ground-based missiles to Europe. (America’s NATO allies, which might not agree to host these missiles, have so far reacted to Trump’s announcement with a mix of praise and criticism .) Burt added that the United States and Russia are now both pouring vast sums of money into upgrading strategic bombers, land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and shiny new objects like hypersonic glide vehicles and anti-satellite systems . “We’re in a process of sleepwalking into a new nuclear-arms race” with no restraints, Burt told me. When he served in government, in the 1980s, there was “a hypersensitivity [to] and awareness of the dangers of a nuclear conflict.” No longer. When it comes to arms-control and nuclear-nonproliferation agreements, Trump has shown himself to be a consummate deal breaker. At the same time, in his pursuit of a nuclear deal with North Korea, a better nuclear deal with Iran, and now an expanded INF Treaty with Russia and China, he has yet to prove himself a deal maker. Taken together, the moves could not just encourage an arms race among nuclear-armed states, but push other countries to consider whether they, too, want to add such weapons. “The existing framework for nuclear control and constraints is unraveling,” Burt noted. “If the two largest nuclear powers are walking away from arms-control agreements, it provides an excuse for other countries to acquire nuclear weapons.” “It’s easy to look back [at the Cold War] and say, ‘Gee, we avoided a nuclear conflict because we were so smart.’ I happen to think it was ‘We were very lucky,’” he continued. “And if we’re going to go through another nuclear-arms race, this time we might not be that lucky.” We want to hear what you think about this article.

"The Impact of the Iran Nuclear Agreement","President Trump’s decision to withdraw from the landmark agreement jeopardizes the unprecedented visibility international inspectors now have into Iran’s nuclear program.  Backgrounder by Zachary Laub  Last updated May 8, 2018 U.S. President Donald J. Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement and reimpose sanctions jeopardizes the landmark arms control agreement, under which Iran dismantled much of its nuclear program and international inspectors gained extensive access to monitor its compliance. The agreement, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), has been on the rocks since Trump’s election, and the resulting climate of uncertainty spooked many large firms from doing business in Iran, thus diminishing the economic incentives that drew Iran to the agreement in the first place. While Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and the agreement’s European signatories will now look to salvage it, it is uncertain whether they can overcome sanctions pressure from the United States. The JCPOA, which was signed in July 2015 and went into effect the following January, imposes restrictions on Iran’s civilian nuclear enrichment program. The so-called P5+1—that is, the five permanent members of the UN Security Council (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and United States) and Germany—negotiated the agreement with Iran over nearly two years. During this period, the Obama administration said its intent was to set back Iran’s nuclear program so that if Iran were to sprint toward producing enough fissile material for a weapon—an indicator known as “breakout time”—it would take at least a year , up from just a few weeks. More on:  Iran Nuclear Agreement   Iran   Nonproliferation, Arms Control, and Disarmament   Sanctions   Nuclear Weapons  Nuclear restrictions on Iran. To extend that breakout time, the agreement requires that uranium enrichment at Fordow and Natanz be restricted and a heavy-water reactor, at Arak, have its core rendered inoperable; its plutonium byproduct, the P5+1 countries feared, could have been reprocessed into weapons-grade material. These facilities are now being repurposed for research, industrial, or medical purposes, and they are subjected to inspections by monitors from the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The accord imposes limits on the numbers and types of centrifuges Iran can operate, as well as the size of its caches of enriched uranium. (Mined uranium has less than 1 percent of the uranium-235 isotope , and centrifuges increase that isotope’s concentration. Uranium enriched to 5 percent is used in nuclear power plants, and at 20 percent it can be used in research reactors or for medical purposes. High-enriched uranium, at some 90 percent, is used in nuclear weapons.) The JCPOA also aims to guard against the possibility that Iran could develop nuclear arms in secret at undeclared sites. Many of the JCPOA’s nuclear provisions have expiration dates. After ten years, for example, centrifuge restrictions will be lifted, and after fifteen years, so too will limits on the low-enriched uranium it can possess, as well as the IAEA’s access to undeclared sites. Monitoring and verification. Among the open-ended provisions, Iran is bound to implement and later ratify an “ additional protocol ” to its safeguards agreement with the IAEA, which gives IAEA inspectors unprecedented access to Iran’s nuclear facilities. (As a signatory to the Nonproliferation Treaty, or NPT, Iran has committed to never pursue nuclear weapons, but it is entitled to pursue nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.) The agency’s director-general, Yukiya Amano, issues quarterly reports to the IAEA Board of Governors and UN Security Council on Iran’s implementation of its nuclear commitments. He has described the arrangement as “the world’s most robust nuclear verification regime.” The JCPOA established the Joint Commission, with the negotiating parties all represented, to monitor implementation of the agreement. That body, chaired by Federica Mogherini, the EU foreign policy chief, is charged with dispute resolution, and a majority vote of its members can gain IAEA inspectors access to undeclared sites they consider suspect. It also oversees the transfer of nuclear-related or dual-use materials. Sanctions relief. In exchange for these limitations on Iran’s nuclear program and opening up access to international inspectors, the European Union, United Nations, and United States all committed to lifting sanctions. While the United States has only suspended extant nuclear sanctions, it pledged in the JCPOA to remove specified entities from sanctions lists and seek legislation to repeal the suspended sanctions within eight years, as long as the IAEA concludes that Iran’s nuclear activities remain peaceful in nature. More on:  Iran Nuclear Agreement   Iran   Nonproliferation, Arms Control, and Disarmament   Sanctions   Nuclear Weapons  Other U.S. sanctions [PDF], some dating back to the hostage crisis in 1979, remained even after the JCPOA took effect. They cover matters such as ballistic missile production, support for U.S.-designated terrorist groups, and domestic human rights abuses. The United States has stopped enforcing its sanctions on oil exports, freeing Iran to trade on international markets again, but restrictions on financial transactions remain in place. Many banks and other companies, including foreign subsidiaries of U.S. businesses, are wary of doing business in Iran for fear of incurring fines or being barred from dealing on Wall Street, and the United States retained the right to impose new sanctions for nonnuclear matters. A major exception to the U.S. embargo allows Boeing to sell aircraft to Iranian airlines. New Security Council resolutions are periodically needed to keep UN sanctions suspended, so, by alleging a major violation, any one of the P5 members can veto a new resolution. This “snapback” mechanism is set to remain in effect for ten years, after which point the UN sanctions are set to be repealed. Implementation Day, on which sanctions were lifted , came once the IAEA certified that Iran had met preliminary requirements, including taking thousands of centrifuges offline, rendering the core of the Arak heavy-water reactor inoperable, and selling excess low-enriched uranium to Russia. Since then, the IAEA’s quarterly reports have found Iran in compliance with the JCPOA’s requirements. Early on, Iran twice exceeded the amount of heavy water that it is allowed under the agreement, the IAEA reported, but these were quickly resolved . “The nuclear-related commitments undertaken by Iran under the JCPOA are being implemented ,” Amano said in October 2017. The challenge inspectors face is that they are “looking to prove the negative,” says Christopher Bidwell , a senior fellow at the Federation of American Scientists. “IAEA reports talk about where Iran is compliant, but then are silent on known rough issues,” he says, highlighting military sites, for which inspectors must seek access from Iranian authorities or adjudication by the Joint Commission. Also omitted from the public record , the International Crisis Group notes, are reports on Iran’s caches of low-enriched uranium and research on centrifuges. “Monitoring is a physical act, but verification is a political act,” Bidwell says. “How sure are you that what you’ve monitored has told you what you want to know?” The United Nations, European Union, and United States all repealed or suspended the sanctions that the JCPOA specified be lifted on Implementation Day, and since then the United States has also unfrozen or delivered to Iran certain seized funds. Most significantly, the United States stopped enforcing secondary sanctions that targeted the oil sector, which has allowed Iran to ramp up its oil exports to nearly the level it had been prior to sanctions. Those sanctions, however, appear likely to come back into force with Trump’s May 8 announcement of the United States’ withdrawal. The announcement capped the year and a half of uncertainty that had enveloped the agreement since Trump’s election. Trump regularly denounced the JCPOA during his campaign, and with each periodic waiver of sanctions he issued as president, he indicated his distaste for it. In October 2017, he took the symbolic step of “decertifying” the JCPOA, saying he judged it not in the national interest. (Periodic certification, like the sanctions waivers, is not a requirement of the JCPOA itself, but rather, one Congress imposed on the president as negotiations were in their final phase.) In January 2018 he issued an ultimatum, saying that if Congress and the United States’ European allies failed to “fix the deal’s disastrous flaws” prior to the next deadline, May 12, he would withdraw the United States from it. Trump objected that the agreement put no restrictions on Iran’s ballistic missiles program or its regional policies, as well as to aspects of the inspections regime and sunset clauses included in it. Even before the U.S. decertification, Iranian officials accused the administration of acting in bad faith, claiming that by sowing doubt over its commitment to the agreement and obstructing economic benefits to Iran, the United States was in violation of the agreement . U.S. officials have discouraged foreign governments and companies from trade with and investment in Iran, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif charged, and the U.S. Treasury under Trump has not licensed the sale of any aircraft or spare parts to Iran. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimated the country’s non-oil growth in 2017 reached 4 percent. Still, Iranians have not seen as robust an economic recovery as many had expected to follow the JCPOA’s implementation. The expectation that the United States would restore nuclear sanctions discouraged trade and investment . So too did a wide range of U.S. sanctions unrelated to the nuclear program. Multinational firms fear being held liable for transacting with the numerous sanctioned entities associated with, for example, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), which is ubiquitous in some industries. But factors unrelated to sanctions are also hampering the recovery. Corruption, mismanagement, and aging infrastructure are widely acknowledged barriers to industry , and relatively low oil prices have dampened the revenues to be made from export; oil was trading for much of 2016–2017 at around half the price it had been five years earlier. (The recent surge of oil prices has in part been attributed to the expectation of renewed sanctions.) Economic stagnation and rising inequality drove a week of widespread protests that began at the end of 2017. The JCPOA was contentious in Iran even before Trump’s election. “The Rouhani government oversold its ability to generate economic recovery following the sanctions relief,” Georgetown University’s Ariane Tabatabai said in an interview before Rouhani was reelected in May 2017, “and so now it is dialing back expectations of what is realistic.” The government has since argued that the recovery will take more time, and that its lag cannot be attributed to sanctions alone. Hard-liners in Iran argued that the United States was angling all along to keep the Iranian economy depressed and that Rouhani was hoodwinked into unfavorable terms, a view they said was bolstered by extreme rhetoric from some members of the Trump administration and Congress. They argued that Iran had “redesigned its nuclear facilities while the sanctions have only been suspended,” and so the United States could reinstate sanctions with relative ease even as the Iranian nuclear program had been permanently set back, said Mohammad Ayatollahi Tabaar , an assistant professor at Texas A&M University’s Bush School of Government and Public Service. Iran could continue to implement its JCPOA obligations as long as the agreement’s European signatories remain committed to carrying out the agreement. But with the United States’ withdrawal, there will be greater pressure in Iran for retaliatory steps, such as incrementally ramping up its nuclear program, or, in an extreme case, withdrawing from the JCPOA, or even the Nonproliferation Treaty. The other parties to the JCPOA are firmly behind it. French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel vigorously lobbied President Trump to remain in the agreement during recent visits to the White House, and British Foreign Minister Boris Johnson made a similar appeal as the May deadline approached. France, Germany, and the United Kingdom were all open to addressing the Trump administration’s concerns in a side agreement, but talks broke down over reinstating sanctions once certain restrictions expire; the European parties argued such a move would violate the agreement. To preserve the JCPOA, the EU could seek to insulate European firms from U.S. secondary sanctions and facilitate oil trade with Iran. Yet the JCPOA could still erode if European measures to preserve it are not sufficient for trade and investment to continue, much less increase, or it could collapse much sooner. As long as the United States is viewed as unilaterally abrogating the JCPOA while Iran remains compliant, experts do not expect the United States’ negotiating partners to follow suit and resurrect the global sanctions regime that drove Iran to the negotiating table in the first place.","https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/impact-iran-nuclear-agreement"

Speaking in the Diplomatic Room of the White House, Mr. Trump delivered harsh words about the 2015 deal to curb and monitor Iran’s nuclear activity, calling it “horrible,” “one-sided” and “disastrous.” The president said he planned to institute sanctions against Iran, and said the U.S. would sanction...

"Israel opposed the U.S.-Iran nuclear deal. But how happy will Israel be if Trump really scraps it?","Israel had opposed the nuclear deal brokered between the United States and Iran, but if President Trump follows through on threats to scrap the pact, the move will present Israel with a volatile predicament. Though Israel long called the terms of the deal flawed, some Israelis fear its demise would spur Iran to further its nuclear ambitions. Under the deal, Iran agreed to destroy or disable most of its nuclear infrastructure in return for the lifting of economic sanctions. In the words of Yoaz Hendel, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's former director of communications, "we're in the same dilemma … the U.S. administration is in." "On the one hand," he said, "it's a bad deal. Israel and the United States must say that all the time. It's a bad deal." On the other hand, "canceling the deal will mean that Iran will harden its position. It wants to be the regional hegemon, and it will want to prove itself. And I mean that in the Middle Eastern sense — militarily — not using the graces of European diplomacy." The Israeli government declined to comment on Trump's possible actions. The president must notify Congress by Sunday whether Iran is complying with the pact. Over the objections of several of his top national security advisors, Trump is leaning toward announcing that Iran is not in compliance. Netanyahu fought hard against the deal, and the disagreement with the Obama administration shook Israel's historic ties to the United States. "This deal caused us very significant damage," Hendel said in an interview, "but it's spilled milk. If Trump certifies the deal, we have a borderline nuclear nation at our border and major consequences in terms of Iran's subsidy of terror organizations, especially Hezbollah. But if he decertifies, we're back where we were in the old days, where the only way to change the regional situation is a military strike." Candidate Trump made canceling the Iran deal, the Obama administration's signature foreign policy achievement, a central campaign promise. In talking of withdrawing from a deal ratified by Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China, Trump appears to be trying to change the pact's framework. Until now, the agreement focused on Iran's nuclear development. In a recent speech to the American Enterprise Institute , U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley said the United States could change what constitutes "compliance" with the agreement, as Netanyahu has been pushing it to do. Perhaps, for example, a revised pact would address Iran's development of missiles. The International Atomic Energy Agency says Iran has been complying with the deal, but critics say the U.N. agency has been too lenient in its reviews of Iran's actions. If Trump declares Iran out of compliance with the 2015 deal, it would fall to Congress to decide whether U.S. sanctions related to the Islamic Republic's nuclear program should be put back in place. Under law, Congress would have 60 days in which to act. "[Trump] wants the headlines of deconstructing various aspects of Obama's legacy — Cuba, Obamacare, the Iran deal — without the actual real-world impact of those decisions or coming up with alternatives," said Dan Shapiro, who served as U.S. ambassador to Israel from 2011 to 2017. "Even some prominent opponents of the deal are trying to spin the fact that Trump will decertify but Congress will decide not to renew the sanctions that were suspended. They seem to want their cake and to eat it too," Shapiro said. For Israel, said Eldad Pardo, an expert on Iran who teaches at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, "the best case would be to leave the deal and then improve it to include missile development." "Trump's advantage is that Iran perceives him as unpredictable," he said. "They are not irrational actors. They will have to submit to him out of fear that the regime could collapse if Trump prepares for war. Iran is in a position of great weakness in relation to the United States, and rattling the deal will remind them of this." Pardo's prediction may have been borne out late Friday when an Iranian source confirmed to Reuters that, hoping to reduce tensions, Tehran had indicated to the six Western signatories of the Obama-era deal that it is open to talks about its ballistic missile arsenal. The assessment of Israel's military intelligence  professionals has consistently been that the deal has offered Israel tangible benefits — that even though inspections in Iran by monitors are not as rigorous as some would like, they are better than no inspections. "The prevailing view of current and retired Israeli military officers is that while it is flawed, the deal is serving Israel's interests," Shapiro said.

The US Treasury has promised “wind-down” periods of 90 to 180 days to let firms extricate themselves from agreements with Iran and avoid US sanctions. That will do little to assuage the European companies that have billions on the line in recently cut contracts with the country of 80 million people. Energy giants like Total (paywall) and Royal Dutch Shell have lucrative agreements to work with Iran, while Renault has a joint venture to make 150,000 cars a year, and Franco-German plane maker Airbus has reportedly delivered just three out of 100 jets promised to Iran, in a deal worth billions. Trump’s decision comes after an intense, failed lobbying effort by French president Emmanuel Macron, German chancellor Angela Merkel, and British foreign secretary Boris Johnson to keep the US in the international deal. In a joint statement , the three countries’ leaders expressed “regret and concern” and insisted they will stay in. The statement, which didn’t address how sanctions might hit European firms, highlighted that they consider the Iran deal the “binding international legal framework” for resolving the country’s nuclear program. Any European companies with a US arm that agreed a deal with Iran would now be violating US law, says Adam Smith, a lawyer at Gibson Dunn who is a former Treasury sanctions official. Those not active in the US could be hit with a “with-us or-against-us sanction,” in which Washington would tell the company that if it wants to keep trading with Iran they can’t trade with America, Smith said. The only way around the sanctions would be for the Trump administration to grant European companies waivers. Executives at Total already have reportedly met (paywall) with French officials to push them to lobby the US. America’s Boeing was originally granted a waiver for a deal to sell 110 planes to Iran, worth around $20 billion. It’s unclear whether that is now under threat. In a press call today (May 8), US national security advisor John Bolton declined to comment on whether any companies would get a waiver. After Nov. 4, “all the U.S. nuclear-related sanctions that had been lifted under the JCPOA will be re-imposed and in full effect,” the US Treasury said. That means banks will be prohibited from doing any business in Iranian rials or purchasing and selling Iranian sovereign debt. Manufacturers will be prohibited from selling Iran aluminum, steel, coal, and software. The entire Iranian auto industry is sanctioned, as is its petrochemical industry, and investments in ports. Even importing Iranian carpets into the US will be prohibited. In response, European countries could adopt a “blocking regulation,” the EU ambassador to the US explained earlier , which has been used in the past to allow EU entities to ignore US sanctions on Cuba. It could also push for non-US courts to decide any legal conflicts.","https://qz.com/1272832/trump-quits-iran-deal-us-sanctions-are-a-heavy-blow-for-europe/"
"Europe Tests the Boundaries on Iran","NAYSAN RAFATI is the Iran analyst at the International Crisis Group. ALI VAEZ directs the Iran project at the International Crisis Group. On January 31, 2019, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom announced their most substantive move yet to save the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, to which they are signatories, from collapse. With the European Union’s blessing, the three states established a special channel that shields trade with Iran from U.S. sanctions. The Instrument in Support of Trade Exchanges, or INSTEX, as the channel is called, holds out the possibility that Europe can yet salvage the nuclear agreement’s core bargain: that Iran was to limit its nuclear activities in return for the normalization of economic relations. The preservation of this arrangement will depend not only on the modicum of European-Iranian trade that INSTEX might help preserve but on whether Europe can navigate a narrow path between what Iran expects and what the United States can tolerate. President Donald Trump’s decision in May 2018 to withdraw from the nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), brought with it the return of powerful U.S. sanctions that had been frozen as part of the agreement. The new sanctions, unlike those that had preceded the JCPOA, have neither UN nor EU support. Washington put them in place unilaterally—but still to devastating effect. In recent months, dozens of international companies have left Iran, the country’s oil exports have halved, its national currency has tumbled in value, and inflation has soared. Iran’s parliamentary think tank has issued a bleak forecast, suggesting that, in the more optimistic of two scenarios, the country could expect -2.6 percent growth this year and -4.5 percent next year. The country’s president has assessed the economic situation as the direst in the four decades since the 1979 revolution. As the White House tries to rally broader international support for its “maximum pressure” campaign, one stubborn fact bedevils its efforts: over the past two years, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the UN secretary-general, and, last week, the U.S. Director of National Intelligence, have consistently Loading, please wait...

"Where do countries stand on the Iran nuclear deal?","Share this article While the Donald Trump administration has been threatening to pull the US out of the Iran nuclear deal, other countries involved in drawing up the 2015 accord have been pulling out all the diplomatic stops to keep Washington on board. Under the deal, Iran agreed to curb its nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief. Officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), it was agreed with the US, the UK, France, China and Russia (the five permanent members of the UN Security Council), as well as Germany. Britain, France and Germany have indicated they will seek to stay in the deal even if the United States withdraws. Here is where the various interested countries stand now. Prime Minister Theresa May spoke with Trump by phone at the weekend. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has gone to Washington on a diplomatic drive to keep the US on side. In an opinion article for the New York Times, Johnson says the UK shares Trump’s concerns over Iran’s “dangerous” actions in the Middle East, its support for terrorist groups, cyberspace behaviour and long-range missile programme. But, he argues, the agreement is the least bad option available — and imposes “handcuffs” on Tehran that have been effective. No deal would “add the possibility of a regional nuclear arms race triggered by Iran dashing for a bomb. That is the scenario which the agreement has helped to prevent,” he writes. The UK’s ambassador to the US has confirmed that London is considering ways of keeping the accord alive, if the US does pull out. “Of course we are looking at all eventualities. My government has said that as long as Iran is in compliance with the deal and wants to stick with it that will be our position as well. So we’re looking at options for maintaining the deal should — which we hope they won’t — should the US administration choose to withdraw,” Sir Kim Darroch told CBS News on Sunday. President Emmanuel Macron has warned that war could ensue if Trump withdraws the US from the deal. “We would open the Pandora’s Box. There could be war,” the French president told the German weekly Der Spiegel. “I don’t think that Donald Trump wants war.” Faced with Trump’s hostility to the current deal, Macron suggested a compromise during his visit to Washington last month. He floated the idea of working towards a new accord — but one which builds upon, rather than ditches, the 2015 measures. He said he agreed with the US president that the current pact was “not sufficient”, adding that a “new deal” should address Iran’s long-term nuclear activity, ballistic missiles and regional influence. More recently, in Australia, the French president repeated that the 2015 accord was a “pillar” for a wider, more global solution. “If we destabilise the whole region because of Iran, we will nourish the next terrorist movements which will be born in the region,” he told Le Journal du Dimanche newspaper. Germany has joined Britain and France in aiming for a separate political agreement — not including Iran, Russia or China — that commits to taking a tougher stance on Iran if this can be agreed with the US State Department. Last week Chancellor Angela Merkel echoed Macron in arguing for the negotiating framework to be broadened. It followed her recent visit to Washington in which she also lobbied Trump directly. Germany's president has joined the chorus calling on the US to stick with the 2015 deal. “It mustn’t be forgotten what could happen if this accord collapsed and if the Middle East began to re-arm,” German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier told ARD television this weekend. As in Berlin, officials in Brussels have been looking at ways of keeping economic ties with Iran intact, to discourage Tehran from taking rash decisions such as leaving the deal in the event of a US withdrawal. Trade has soared since the European Union lifted most of its sanctions on Iran. Mechanisms are being considered to protect European firms doing business with Iran, should they face US legal action if Washington reimposes its own sanctions. This could include reviving a special EU blocking statute developed in the 1990s to shield European companies, but it’s thought such a move might be largely a symbolic step to show Iran that Europe was committed to the deal. The EU, which helped broker the 2015 accord, has promoted the role of international institutions and dialogue in a bid to head off hasty decisions. Foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini has reminded the US and Israel that according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), “Iran has fully complied with its commitments”. The nuclear watchdog has, however, recorded several technical violations by Iran since it began verifications in 2016. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has echoed Trump in describing the 2015 pact as “horrible”, citing Israeli intelligence pointing to the existence of a secret Iranian nuclear weapons programme before 2003. Failure to disclose it, he said, meant that Iran had violated the accord. “Iran lied, big time,” Netanyahu said. He is vehemently opposed to the deal, which he says only halts Iran’s nuclear capability temporarily. Israel is also believed to have nuclear weapons, although it has not confirmed or denied it. Russia has repeatedly said it wants the Iran nuclear deal left intact. On Friday Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Moscow would deem any changes to the deal to be unacceptable. This weekend Russia and China issued a joint statement, reaffirming their “unwavering support for the comprehensive and effective implementation” of the 2015 accord, backing the IAEA’s “essential and independent role” and its findings. Moscow, which has said it believes “no alternative exists” to the nuclear deal, is to host Netanyahu this week. The Israeli prime minister is due to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin. President Hassan Rouhani said on Sunday that Iran would respond to any move by Trump to renege on the 2015 agreement. “We have plans to resist any decision by Trump on the nuclear accord,” he said in a speech broadcast live on state television. The Iranian leader warned that Tehran would revive its nuclear energy programme, and would not be intimidated into limiting its missile power, should the US withdraw. “We will not negotiate with anyone about our weapons and defences, and we will make and store as many weapons, facilities and missiles as we need,” Rouhani said. Iranian leaders have rejected talks on the country’s missile programme, insisting it is defensive. However, some observers believe the Iranian president would be weakened by a US withdrawal. Beset by domestic problems including a poorly-performing economy, Rouhani is also thought to be threatened by hardliners looking to constrain his attempts to open up to the West.

"Europe’s balancing act on the nuclear deal: wooing Trump without losing Iran","Ellie Geranmayeh  @EllieGeranmayeh  02nd May, 2018  European leaders have been assiduous in lobbying Washington on the nuclear deal. But Europe must step up its diplomacy to ensure it does not lose Tehran in the process For much of Iran’s political elite, and its overwhelmingly young population, the nuclear deal is becoming a story of failure. This situation risks impacting on Tehran’s willingness to engage politically and to reach diplomatic compromises with Western powers. Last week European leaders were in Washington for a last push to keep the United States on board ahead of the 12 May deadline for Donald Trump to issue waivers required under the nuclear deal. During his visit, Emmanuel Macron suggested that the US and Europe could work on a “new deal” with Iran – one which preserves but expands on the 2015 accord. But with Iran kept out of the European-US talks, Hassan Rouhani has questioned the legitimacy of proposals now put forward by Macron and Angela Merkel for Iran to negotiate further deals on its nuclear programme and regional issues. In the process of wooing Washington on this bigger and better deal, Europe must ensure it does not end up losing Tehran, whose buy-in will be essential to succeeding in this effort. Despite increasing pressures coming from Trump, Iran has continued to fulfil its part of the deal, as verified by the International Atomic Energy Agency 11 times since the deal was implemented in January 2016. Iran has waited to see what actions Trump would take and carefully assessed the ability and willingness of Europe to safeguard the nuclear deal. In October, Tehran sent out clear signals that it would consider sticking to the deal so long as Europe, China, and Russia could deliver a package that served Iran’s national security interests. But as talks between the US and the EU3 (Germany, France, and the United Kingdom) have stepped up over the last few months, Iranian thinking on European positioning has begun to sour. Officials and experts from Iran, interviewed on condition of anonymity over the past month, outlined a growing perception inside Tehran that Europe is unable and/or unwilling to deliver on the nuclear agreement without the US. Even those who defend the nuclear deal inside the country are finding it difficult to continue to do so, not just because of Trump but also because of European tactics, which one Iranian official described as “appeasement by Europe to reward the violator of the deal and Iran’s expense”. This perception has contributed to considerably hardened Iranian rhetoric in recent weeks around a possible US withdrawal. The secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council (SNSC), which includes the most important decision-makers inside the country, warned that Iran may not only walk away from the nuclear deal, but also withdraw from the Non-Proliferation Treaty . Such public statements from senior figures signal that a rethink may be taking place over Iran’s foreign policy orientation and openness to engaging with the West. Decision-makers in Europe should be alert to the gravity of such political shifts. Iranian officials have repeatedly outlined that Iran will abide by the nuclear deal so long as the US does not violate the agreement. If Europe wants to keep Iran on board with the agreement in the scenario where Trump does not issue the sanctions waivers required, or to even sell a new European-US framework to Iran, it will need to shore up its fast-diminishing political capital with Tehran. While Macron’s hour-long call with Rouhani on Sunday was a good start, greater activity is urgently needed. First, Europeans should seek to alleviate growing Iranian fears that the price of saving the deal will be a wider “pressure package”, one which returns their relations to the pre-2013 policy of isolation and sanctions. While the focus is understandably now on securing ongoing US support for the deal, the EU3 should not neglect the fact that any new framework agreed will require at least some Iranian buy-in to make it workable. In the current political climate in Iran, this is not a given.  As such, the EU3 should, as a unified coalition, work at the highest level with Iran’s foreign ministry to shore up confidence regarding the nuclear deal. In advance of the 12 May deadline, if it looks increasingly likely that Trump will not waive sanctions, the newly appointed German foreign minister should follow up on Macron’s call to Rouhani with a visit to Tehran to meet with their Iranian counterpart and consider contingencies (some measures for which are outlined below). Second, EU member states should delay the prospect of new sanctions targeting Iranian regional behaviour, at least until firmer guarantees are in place regarding Trump’s decision on the nuclear deal. The timing of such sanctions has reportedly been the topic of heated debate among the 28 member states. At a minimum, the countries supporting such measures should step up their public messaging to communicate the reasons and the targeted nature of new sanctions, including a commitment that these are not the start of more far-reaching sanctions that will hurt the wider Iranian economy. This is particularly the case with Iran’s private sector, which constantly meets new hurdles placed in its way when seeking to do business with Europe. Third, European governments should double down on efforts to maintain Iranian compliance to the nuclear deal if Trump fails to renew waivers due on 12 May. Such action by the White House would result in the snap-back of US secondary sanctions and are likely to be viewed in Tehran as significant non-performance of the nuclear deal. Europe will need to coordinate with Russia and China to persuade Iran to continue adhering to its nuclear obligations, at least for a period of time. The exhaustion of the dispute resolution mechanism under the nuclear deal can buy time (estimated to be between 2-3 months) for contingency planning while allowing Iran to save face. In this scenario, European governments will need to convince the US that it will be in their mutual interest to agree on an amicable separation on the nuclear deal. Europeans will need to argue that such a settlement would allow Trump to claim victory with his base for withdrawing US participation in the JCPOA, while avoiding deeper damage to transatlantic relations and possibly maintaining Europe’s quiet compliance on regional issues. This path should also allow the US to reverse its course (Europeans should continue to encourage such a reversal, whatever the 12 May decision). As part of this contingency plan, to keep Iran on board Europeans will need to offer some degree of economic relief. It will be critical to reach a pan-European deal with the Trump administration to limit the extent to which the US secondary sanctions that may snap back are actually enforced by US regulators. This should include a series of exemptions and carve-outs for European companies already involved in strategic areas of trade and investment with Iran, with the priority being to limit the immediate shock to Iranian oil exports. European governments should further make a strong case to the Iranian government and public as to why the nuclear deal can continue to serve Iran’s security and economic interest even without the US. They should emphasise the immediate economic benefits of continued oil exports to Europe and possible longer-term commitments for investments in the country. Sustained political rapprochement between Europe and Iran could also influence Asian countries that closely watch European actions (such as Japan, South Korea, and India) to retain economic ties with Iran. Finally, regardless of the fate of the nuclear deal, Europe should keep the pathway open for regional talks with Iran. Germany, France, the UK, and Italy should establish and formalise a regular high-level regional dialogue with Iran that builds on those held in February in Munich. It is a positive sign that a second round of such talks is reportedly due to be held this month in Rome. Such engagement will become even more important if the US withdraws from the nuclear deal, increasing the risk of regional military escalation that is already surfacing between Israel and Iran in Syria. Europeans should focus these talks on damage limitation and de-escalation in both Yemen and Syria, to help create an Israeli-Iranian and Saudi-Iranian modus vivendi in both conflict theatres (something which the US seems uninterested in). Ultimately, Iran’s willingness to implement any follow-up measures on regional issues will be heavily influenced by the fate of the nuclear deal and how the fallout over Trump’s actions is managed. Europe may well not be capable of salvaging the deal if the US withdraws from or violates it. But Europe must at least attempt to do so and demonstrate its political willingness through actions that serve as a precedent for the international community. To do otherwise is likely to have an immediate and consequential impact on Iranian foreign policy and significantly reduce Europe’s relevance for the Iranian political establishment. For Iran’s youth, as the largest population bloc in the country, this will be an important experience in how far Europe is willing to go in delivering on its promises to defend the nuclear deal, whose collapse would affect the Iranian psyche and domestic political discourse for years to come.

"Haley wrongly says Congress had no input on Iran nuclear deal","Your privacy is important to us. We have updated our privacy policy to better explain how we use data on this site. Read it here — Nikki Haley on Sunday, October 15th, 2017 in comments on ABC By Allison Colburn  on Thursday, October 19th, 2017 at 12:13 p.m.  Defending President Donald Trump’s decision to decertify the Iran nuclear deal, United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley said Congress now has a voice on the issue that it didn’t have in the past. Trump’s decision allows Congress to potentially kill the agreement or tack on new conditions. "He's saying to Congress, can we make it better?" Haley told ABC’s George Stephanopoulos on an Oct. 15 broadcast of This Week . "And I think that his engagement with Congress is something that never happened under President Obama. They were never allowed to debate it. They were never allowed to discuss it. So, now Congress is going to be fully engaged on the threats of Iran." This was an early criticism of the agreement. After the United States, Iran and other foreign governments came to an agreement on the framework for the Iran deal, both Republicans and Democrats in Congress appealed to Obama to let them have a say in it before the final deal was reached. Here, we are fact-checking Haley’s claim that Congress was "never allowed" to debate or discuss the agreement. Much of the responsibility for U.S. foreign policy falls under the authority of the executive branch . Congress does play a significant role, however, in foreign trade and commerce, immigration, foreign aid, the defense budget and any declarations of war. The Senate authorizes treaties and confirms the president’s cabinet nominees. To avoid needing Senate approval for an agreement with a foreign power, the president can simply avoid calling the agreement a treaty . The Obama administration said the Iran deal was neither a treaty nor an executive agreement. Instead, the State Department said in a letter that the deal "reflects political commitments" between the seven nations involved. When the president negotiates a deal that is not deemed a treaty, Congress -- if it wants a say on the deal -- must convince the president to give the legislative branch the power to approve or block the final deal. That’s exactly what Congress did when it passed the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015 , a bill that had bipartisan support and allowed Congress the right to review any agreement reached in the negotiations. Obama initially threatened to veto the bill but did not. Senators considered a separate, and ultimately unsuccessful, measure that would have given them the the power to block the agreement through a resolution of disapproval. A procedural vote on the resolution fell short of the 60 votes needed to override a Democratic filibuster. Despite the resolution’s failure, by passing the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, Congress was able to have some authority and say in the final agreement. Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., who spearheaded the bill, has touted the legislation for taking "power back from the president" and forcing the executive office to be transparent. "There’s no question the prior administration made every effort to bypass Congress and implement the agreement without congressional review or approval," Corker said in an emailed statement. "That is why we overwhelmingly passed INARA, which required the administration to submit the full details of the agreement to Congress and established a process for a debate and vote on the deal." It should also be noted that Obama administration officials went on the record about the Iran deal during congressional hearings and briefings, allowing members of Congress to bring up questions and concerns with the White House in a public debate setting. Further, the review act imposed a requirement that the president recertify the deal every 90 days. In other words, every three months the president must ensure the following: Iran is abiding by the rules of the agreement, Iran hasn’t taken action to advance its nuclear weapons program, the waiver of sanctions on Iran are still appropriate. "This kind of ongoing management I think is unusual and represented quite a compromise by President Obama," said John Glaser, the director of foreign studies at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute. Glaser pointed out that the Obama administration would not have been able to handle "all of the subtlety, secrecy, and nuance that was required" to negotiate the Iran deal if it had involved Congress from the beginning. Haley, we should note, backtracked a bit in an interview on Meet The Press , when moderator Chuck Todd pointed out that the reason the Iran deal has a certification process is because Congress added constraints. Haley responded: "And Congress did that because President Obama didn't give them the authority to be a part of that decision. So they did it to try and control the situation and not let it get to a bad problem." She didn't add similar caveats during the ABC interview. Haley said Congress was never allowed to debate or discuss the Iran nuclear agreement while Obama was in office. Though Congress had to fight for the right to disapprove of the deal, the passage of the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015 allowed Congress to not only vote on the deal but to also hold public hearings and debate. The Senate ultimately did not have the votes to block the deal, but the act included a requirement for the president to frequently monitor Iran’s progress in meeting the agreement’s conditions. So Congress did have input, even if Obama initially tried to avoid it. We rate this claim Mostly False.

"The Iran Nuclear Deal – A Simple Guide","Advertisement  By WILLIAM J. BROAD and  SERGIO PEÇANHA   UPDATED Jan. 15, 2015   Negotiators reached a historic accord last summer to limit Tehran’s nuclear ability in return for lifting international oil and financial sanctions. Here is a guide to the Iran nuclear deal .   An atomic bomb can be made from two types of radioactive materials: uranium or plutonium. The talks were aimed at curbing Iran’s ability to put  these two elements to use in weapons. In each case, the manufacturing starts with uranium ore. Uranium mined from the earth is less than 1 percent  U-235, the isotope that can be used to fuel reactors and make bombs. Centrifuges are needed to separate the U-235 from the rest of the uranium, in a process called enrichment. The other fuel that can be used to make a bomb, plutonium, is made by irradiating uranium in a nuclear reactor. The process transforms some of the uranium into plutonium.  Path 1 Uranium Centrifuges Uranium ore Path 2 Reactor Plutonium Path 1 Uranium Centrifuges Uranium ore Path 2 Reactor Plutonium Uranium ore Centrifuges Reactor Uranium Plutonium  During the enrichment process, centrifuges are used to raise concentrations of U-235. For most power reactors in the West, uranium is enriched up to 5 percent. Bomb grade is above 90 percent and Iran had been processing ore to 20 percent enrichment.  The agreement Iran has agreed to transform its deeply buried plant at Fordo into a center for science research. Another uranium plant, Natanz, is to be cut back rather than shut down. Some 5,000 centrifuges for enriching uranium will remain spinning there, about half the current number.

Iran has also agreed to limit enrichment to 3.7 percent and to cap its stockpile of low-enriched uranium at 300 kilograms, or 660 pounds, for 15 years. That is considered insufficient for a bomb rush.  Uranium ore Centrifuges 90% 20% 3.7% Uranium ore Centrifuges 90% 20% 3.7% Uranium enrichment 90% Uranium ore Centrifuges 20% 3.7%  Iran was constructing a nuclear reactor at Arak that would have used natural uranium to produce Pu-239, which can fuel bombs.  The agreement Iran has agreed to redesign and rebuild the Arak reactor so it will not produce weapons-grade plutonium. The original core of the reactor, which would enable the production of weapons-grade plutonium, will be made inoperable, but will stay in the country. Under the terms of  the deal, the reactor’s spent fuel, which could also be used to produce a bomb, will be shipped out of the country. Iran will not build any additional heavy water reactors for 15 years.  Radiation Arak 238 239 Radiation Arak 238 239 Arak Radiation 238 239  More than twice the size of Texas in area, Iran poses many challenges for atomic inspectors who have to police the agreement and gain access not only to scientists, labs and factories, but also to many underground sites and military bases. Western allies say the new inspections must be far more intrusive than those in the past, given the deal’s sweeping terms as well as Iran’s history of evasions, stonewalling and illicit procurements. The principal concerns are how to detect cheating and covert sites.  The agreement Iran has agreed to provide the International Atomic Energy Agency greater access and information regarding its nuclear program, and to allow the agency to investigate suspicious sites or allegations of covert facilities related to uranium enrichment anywhere in the country. Inspectors will also have access to the supply chain that supports Iran’s nuclear program, including uranium mines and mills, and to continuous surveillance of centrifuge manufacturing and storage facilities.   The deal requires Iran to reduce its current stockpile of low-enriched uranium by 98 percent, and limits Iran’s enrichment capacity and research and development for 15 years. Some inspections and transparency measures will remain in place for as long as 25 years. According to President Obama: “This relief will be phased in. Iran must complete key nuclear steps before it begins to receive sanctions relief.” Sanctions for arms could be lifted in five years, ballistic missiles in eight.   The agreement increases the “breakout” time — the amount of time it would take Iran to produce enough bomb-grade material for a singular nuclear weapon — to at least one year.

"Trump’s Only Iran Strategy Is to Punish Iran","The administration doesn’t want a grand bargain with the Islamic Republic. They want a different government. After Donald Trump’s announcement last week that the United States was walking away from the Iran nuclear deal, two State Department officials held a background briefing to explain the strategy. The transcript is a painful read . From start to finish, the unnamed officials struggled to answer the most basic questions about the purpose of reimposing sanctions on Iran, what they expected to achieve, which allies they had consulted, and so on. Every time a reporter tried to pin them down on the core question—now that you’ve junked the deal, what comes next?— they mumbled and evaded. This past Friday, reporters tried again, on another conference call with a senior State Department official. They pressed him for specifics on what exactly the plan will be going forward. The most he would offer was that the United States would bring “all necessary pressure to bear on Iran to change its behavior and to pursue a new framework that can resolve our concerns.” It is hard to get less specific than that. This is not because these officials are uninformed or unintelligent. And it is not because key figures in the administration, like National-Security Adviser John Bolton, haven’t given it some thought. My guess is it is because, for some reason, they did not feel comfortable sharing the real answer,  which is this: The punishment is the strategy. The United States will now apply the means of more economic pressure to achieve the end of Iran feeling more economic pressure. In theory, sanctions should have a specific purpose. We impose them in response to certain behavior by another country, and offer to lift them in exchange for specified changes in that behavior. In other words, sanctions create leverage, which is then converted into concessions at the negotiating table. That was the story of the Iran nuclear deal, which I helped negotiate, including by opening the secret back channel with Iran that jump-started the diplomacy. Advocates of a more aggressive Iran policy, both inside and outside the administration, view sanctions differently. They seem to feel they don’t need to give more-specific answers as to what exactly sanctions are intended to achieve, because from their perspective, whatever is achieved is better than the status quo. Maybe with sufficient pressure, the regime will collapse. That would be their ideal outcome, and it’s what John Bolton was referring to recently when he said, “Iran’s economic condition is really quite shaky, so that the effect [of reimposing sanctions] could be dramatic.” But maybe not—maybe sanctions will just leave the regime weakened and demoralized and inwardly focused.  That would be good, too. But maybe not—maybe the regime will just have less disposable income to spend on regional adventurism and therefore reduce its activities in places like Syria and Yemen. That’s not bad. But maybe not—maybe sanctions will simply make it harder for Iran to become stronger, an economic version of containment. Even that will do. Or maybe, alternatively, sanctions will lead Iran to come back to the table, to accept the administration’s maximalist demands regarding their nuclear program, their missile program, and their regional activities. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is giving a speech next week where he will ostensibly argue that this is the plan. But if you try to pin down Trump’s defenders on what the “better deal” would actually look like—what specific terms it would have to include—you quickly discover that this is not a particularly serious proposition. For example, in one breath, they say that an agreement on nuclear issues isn’t enough; a broader regional settlement is required. In the next breath, they say that the current regime is by definition incapable of becoming a more benign regional actor.  Iran hawks like John Bolton don’t want a grand bargain with Iran. They want a different government in Iran. What about Donald Trump? Where is he in all of this? Well, nowhere, really. He cared a lot about tearing down the agreement, and sticking it to Barack Obama in the process. He cares little to not at all about what comes next. Indeed, he would probably take a very similar deal to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), as the Iran deal is formally known, if it had his name on it. But his team takes over from here, and whatever their rhetoric about diplomacy, they see a new nuclear agreement as a constraint, not an objective. The most illuminating moment of last week’s background briefing was when one of the officials said that “the problem with the deal was that it reduced our ability to pressure Iran,” repeating twice that the deal cordoned off sectors of the Iranian economy from sanctions. So abandoning the deal, they said, has given them wide-open running room on economic pressure. Now, it’s fair to ask—what’s wrong with all of this? After all, the current Iranian regime is a repressive and abusive actor at home and a malign actor in the region, responsible for a great deal of chaos and death. Why not pressure them relentlessly, to impose costs at a minimum and spark change inside Iran at a maximum? I agree that curbing and countering Iran’s regional behavior is a crucial priority for American policy. The Iran debate is not a quarrel over whether to challenge Islamic Republic’s negative influence in the region, but how. And I see a number of basic problems with the approach the administration is taking. Above all, there is the abject folly of breaking the Iran deal when it was working as intended to achieve its objective: blocking Iran from getting a nuclear bomb. The end of the Iran deal means the end of our ability to enforce constraints on Iran’s nuclear program through means other than military coercion. We can’t expect that they will indefinitely uphold their side of the bargain when we’ve stopped upholding ours. They are likely to eventually move their program forward in order to gain leverage against us. So this strategy could easily generate a nuclear crisis over time, and a self-inflicted one at that. This was especially unnecessary given that the deal did not preclude the U.S. and its allies from pursuing a more aggressive strategy to check Iran’s regional behavior—indeed, the Europeans had signaled their willingness to do just that. If you care about Iran’s behavior in the Middle East, killing the deal is a distraction at best. Now the world will have to return to worrying about a nuclear program that was previously under lock and key. The talk in Europe today is about Washington’s approach toward the nuclear deal, not Tehran’s approach toward the region. But even setting aside the deal, the administration’s approach to Iran is not sound. First, any policy that lacks a defined objective or clear endgame—that basically says, let’s keep raising the pressure and see what happens—runs the risk of leading to mistakes, bad choices, and escalation at times and places we can’t control. This is especially true where regime change is part of the equation. The notion that you can simply switch out an unsavory government in another country introduces a magical quality to strategic decision-making, leaving it less rigorous and reality-based and more prone to error. Proponents of regime change are constantly tempted to assess that the regime in question is “on the brink of collapse, if only we push just a little harder and do a little more.” This tendency can drive policy choices in dangerous and misguided directions, and already has in the case of Iran; along with removing Iran’s nuclear handcuffs, it makes military confrontation between the United States and Iran more likely. Indeed, some (though certainly not all) proponents of this approach are spoiling for just that. Second, despite lots of rhetoric to the contrary, the increased economic pressure Trump ordered has not been, and probably will not be, accompanied by any coherent approach in the key Middle Eastern theaters. Is there a plan for dealing with Iran’s growing influence in Syria, which is ground zero for its regional adventurism? When this question was posed to the State Department officials, one said simply, “the president’s focus in Syria is on ISIS.” What about new ideas to address Iranian influence in Iraq, Yemen, or Lebanon? No answers were forthcoming. This is not surprising, given that for the past 16 months, Trump has placed little priority on challenging Iran in the region; to the contrary, he has consistently indicated he wants to get out and leave the raging conflicts to others. The administration’s defenders will argue that it was the nuclear deal itself that led Iran to engage in more-aggressive regional behavior, because it gave them access to funds they would not otherwise have had. But the main driver of Iran’s activity in the region has not been the availability of cash—it’s been the availability of opportunities. As new opportunities arose, the Iranians took advantage of them, sanctions or no sanctions. That was true before the nuclear deal, when they were deeply engaged in malign activity across the Middle East (including material support to Assad in Syria, Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in Gaza, and the militant opposition in Bahrain, as well as killing American troops in Iraq). It was true while the nuclear deal was being negotiated (when the Houthis, an Iran-linked militia, launched their assault on Yemen’s capital). It was true while the U.S. was in the nuclear deal. And it will be true going forward. Indeed, many of the commentators who now say Iran was unleashed on the region because of the nuclear agreement are the same individuals who used to raise the alarm about Iran’s regional behavior years before the agreement went into place. The lesson of all this is that sanctions are not a magic bullet, and the incoherence of the administration's approach will likely lead to more, not less, instability. Third, even to the extent sanctions can help shape Iran’s decisions, they will only be truly effective if they are more or less global in scope—if all of Iran’s major trading partners get on board. For many years, the sanctions imposed by the United States had little impact on Iran, and even isolated America, because the rest of the world saw them as punitive, not purposeful. From 2010 to 2015, we were able to rally the international community to join us in far stronger sanctions because we made it clear they were designed for a specific objective, curbing Iran’s nuclear program. Now we are asking key countries to join us again in a serious economic pressure campaign when (a) we’ve abandoned the deal we negotiated with those very countries, (b) they view Iran with more sympathy now than they did in 2010, and us with less, and (c) we’re asking them to enforce sanctions pretty much for sanctions sake, pretty much indefinitely. This is not a recipe for success. Trump’s team responds to this concern by saying, essentially, “Just make other countries choose between trading with the United States and trading with Iran, and they’ll have to do what we say.” It’s true that threats and bullying will deter a number of European banks and businesses from doing business with Iran. But sanctions are a lot more effective when the world is actively cooperating with the United States to pressure Iran, and a lot less effective when the world is actively cooperating with Iran to frustrate the United States by looking for workarounds and dragging their feet. And in the long run, this “our way or the highway” approach will make sanctions themselves a wasting asset—not just with Iran but across the board—as other countries, including our friends, develop techniques to keep their economies from being held hostage. None of these arguments is going to move the administration. In the end, they don’t really have a policy toward Iran so much as they have an attitude toward Iran. As Trump has repeatedly said, including with respect to Iran, “we’ll see what happens.” When a president does something as risky as pull out of a duly negotiated international agreement, he and his team should have more of a plan than that.

"U.S. trying to move forward after quitting Iran nuclear deal as Europe looks to thwart effort","17 M/CLOUDY    AFP-JIJI, Reuters WASHINGTON/TEHRAN - After leaving the Iran nuclear deal, Washington wants to move forward by offering to build a “coalition” to counter the multiple “threats” posed by the Tehran regime — but Europeans intent on saving the accord may thwart that effort. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday will unveil a new “diplomatic road map” for Iran — how America plans to “address the totality of Iran’s threats,” according to the State Department’s director of policy planning, Brian Hook.  Washington is looking to draft a “new security architecture and a better security framework, a better deal,” Hook told reporters ahead of the speech, the first major policy address by Pompeo since he became America’s top diplomat. “The U.S. will be working hard to put together a coalition,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said, flagging Washington’s bid for a multilateral approach after its unilateral withdrawal from the 2015 accord, in which Tehran agreed to curb its nuclear work in return for the lifting of most Western sanctions. U.S. President Donald Trump has long trashed the deal with Iran — concluded under his predecessor, Barack Obama, together with Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia — saying it did not do enough to curtail Tehran’s nuclear ambitions. The Republican leader also said it did not go far enough in restricting Iran’s ballistic missile program or its intervention in regional conflicts from Yemen to Iraq and Syria. “We need … a framework that’s going to address the totality of Iran’s threats,” Hook said. So far, the guidelines of this new strategy are unclear. The big unknown is whether European leaders, who were bitterly disappointed by Trump’s decision to ditch the deal, would be willing to return to talks with his administration any time soon. For now, the European Union is trying to persuade Iran to stay in the agreement, even without Washington’s participation. Visiting Tehran, the EU’s energy chief sought to reassure Iran on Saturday that the bloc remains committed to salvaging the deal. Miguel Arias Canete also said the 28-nation EU, once the biggest importer of Iranian oil, hopes to strengthen trade with Iran. “We have sent a message to our Iranian friends that as long as they are sticking to the (nuclear) agreement, the Europeans will … fulfill their commitment. And they said the same thing on the other side,” Arias Canete told reporters after talks with Iran’s nuclear chief, Ali Akbar Salehi. Salehi said it would be disastrous if EU efforts fail to preserve the deal: “The ball is in their court. We hope their efforts materialize.” Since Trump’s announcement of the U.S. exit on May 8, EU leaders have pledged to try to keep Iran’s oil trade and investment flowing but have admitted that will not be easy to do so. Britain, France and Germany back the deal as the best way of stopping Tehran from getting nuclear weapons but have called on Iran to limit its regional influence and curb the missile program. “The EU’s adopted mechanisms … should be enforced by Aug. 8, when U.S. sanctions begin to take effect,” Iranian TV quoted Behrouz Kamalvandi, spokesman for Iran’s Atomic Energy Organization, as saying. A collapse of the accord could tip the balance of power in Iran’s faction-ridden political establishment in favor of President Hassan Rouhani’s hard-line rivals, who have fiercely criticized the president’s failure to deliver greater economic prosperity. Rouhani has tried to assure ordinary Iranians, frustrated by high unemployment and stagnant living standards, that Trump’s decision would have no impact on Iran’s oil-reliant economy. Salehi said Iran had several options, including resuming its 20 percent uranium enrichment, if the European countries failed to keep the pact alive. He said the EU has only a few weeks to deliver on their promises. “If the other side keeps itself committed to its promises, we also will. … We hope the situation will not arise to the point that we will have to go back to the worst option,” Salehi told reporters in English. “There are all kind of possibilities — we can … start the 20 percent enrichment.” Under the deal, Iran’s level of enrichment must remain at around 3.6 percent. Iran stopped producing 20 percent enriched uranium and gave up the majority of its stockpile as part of the agreement. Uranium refined to 20 percent fissile purity is well beyond the 5 percent normally required to fuel civilian nuclear power plants, although still well short of the highly enriched purity of 80 to 90 percent that is needed for a nuclear bomb. In their diplomacy with Tehran, EU sources say Iranian government officials have warned that they are under pressure from those who say Iran has traded away its nuclear sovereignty without reaping any economic benefits. The re-establishment of the U.S. sanctions that were lifted after the Iran nuclear deal was signed will force European companies to choose between investing in Iran or trading with the United States. In reality, there is no choice — European companies cannot afford to forsake the U.S. market. And with investment from Europe — which had been the main carrot dangled before the Iranians to right their struggling economy — now stymied, Tehran may have little incentive to hold up its end of the bargain. The Europeans have tried to squeeze a little flexibility out of Washington to help out their firms, but to no avail. “They tell us, ‘We want the sanctions to hurt; there won’t be any exemptions,’ ” said one European official. Some in the U.S. administration are calling for a “North Korea scenario,” meaning the imposition of sanctions so severe that they force Iran back to the negotiating table. By reimposing the sanctions, Washington aims to “bring economic pressure to bear on Iran,” Hook said. “It was economic pressure that brought the Iranians to the table a few years ago.” But Jake Sullivan, a former Obama administration official who is now a researcher at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said: “The idea that we are going to be able to reconstruct sanctions at the same level (as 2015) is a flawed concept.” “The more aggressive the U.S. is in telling the Europeans, basically, ‘We have you under our thumbs,’ the more the Europeans are going to say, ‘We will find any means we possibly can to not let you do that to us,’ ” he said Friday. Washington has sought to downplay the differences with its allies. “We agree with the Europeans on much, much more than we disagree on,” said Hook, citing “a lot of progress” during talks with Paris, London and Berlin that aimed to find solutions to Trump’s concerns. The U.S. official also mentioned French President Emmanuel Macron’s proposal of a “new deal” based on the accord but offering a broader strategy on Iran. But those negotiations, and Macron’s proposal, pre-dated the abrupt U.S. withdrawal from the accord. Are they still on the table? And how could an accord be reached now if it was impossible less than two weeks ago? “We are waiting to see more details,” said a European official. Another European official warned, “If it is a question of building a coalition to push for regime change in Iran, the Europeans won’t be on board.” For Sullivan, the next phase is one in which “the punishment is the strategy — squeezing Iran and keeping them in the penalty box for as long as possible, and as much as possible, with the hope of regime change, but if it’s not regime change, (then) a weaker regime.”  Click to enlarge  U.S. , U.N. , EU , nuclear weapons , Iran , Nuclear energy , Iran nuclear deal , Donald Trump  Chinese tourists to Japan switch from shopping sprees to medical services A tale of two ads (and two different sets of eyes) 'Terrace House' returns to Tokyo Understanding the peaks and valleys of Japan-South Korea ties Scotland's Stuart Hogg looks ahead to rematch with Brave Blossoms DEEP DIVE Episode 14: What’s the deal with Terrace House?

"In exiting the Iran deal, Trump left U.N. sanctions relief intact—why that could pose problems down the road","The president’s decision to violate the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) with Iran by indicating U.S. intent to reimpose sanctions and withdraw from the agreement has been rightly condemned as a mistake. Some supporters of the Iran nuclear deal have taken comfort from the fact that, in taking the United States out of the JCPOA, Donald Trump did not simultaneously launch the snap-back of U.N. Security Council (UNSC) sanctions against Iran. They have suggested that this will protect the JCPOA for a bit longer and, simultaneously, avoid demonstrating how isolated the United States is at the U.N. Security Council. All of this may be true and, for the time being, keeping Security Council involvement at bay may be in the best interests of both the agreement and the United States. Yet, the failure to pursue snap-back at the UNSC ceded significant leverage that the United States could have used now and that the international community may wish to have in the future, compounding the damage of this hasty decision. Since July 2006 , the UNSC has adopted four resolutions imposing sanctions on Iran in response to concerns about its nuclear and missile programs. Five are particularly salient: When the Iran nuclear deal negotiations concluded, the UNSC decided to adopt a new resolution ( UNSCR 2231 ) that would replace the previous ones. It phased out the conventional arms- and missile-related prohibitions in five and eight years, respectively, and changed the nuclear prohibitions from a blanket set of denials to a somewhat more permissive regime. This would require Iran and those exporting nuclear goods to Iran to submit export applications to a procurement channel that would guard against illicit Iranian nuclear traffic and ensure that JCPOA members could scrutinize any of Iran’s nuclear-related procurement. This requirement would phase out in 10 years, when the UNSC’s mandate over Iran was scheduled to expire. The adoption of UNSCR 2231 and its contents were highly controversial, and critics charged that it badly compromised the international framework for confronting Iran. In particular, they expressed concern that the JCPOA and UNSCR 2231 would enable Iran to acquire conventional arms and missiles without restrictions after the expiration dates. They also took issue with the procurement channel, arguing that it had structural deficiencies and pointing out that the requirement to use it would one day lapse. Many of these critics championed the “fix or nix” approach (that the president ultimately resolved on May 8 in favor of “nix”), in part on the basis of these critiques. Perhaps more fundamentally, JCPOA critics said that the core error of the nuclear deal was that it eliminated a legal prohibition on Iran’s ability to enrich uranium and process plutonium—established in UNSCR 1737 in December 2006—in favor of the more permissive approach in the JCPOA. Taking aside whether these criticisms are accurate, fair, or valid, they were a major part of the argument against the JCPOA in 2015.

Ambassador Nikki Haley’s efforts to draw attention to Iran’s activities in Yemen, though thus far unpersuasive according to other U.N. missions with whom I have spoken, also demonstrate that some in the U.S. government still see the value of multilateral cooperation. Without question, snap-back was within Washington’s reach, since the JCPOA and UNSCR 2231 allowed any permanent UNSC member to reimpose UNSC sanctions on its own (as paragraphs 36 and 37 of the JCPOA make clear), after a process lasting 60 to 80 days. The United States insisted on these provisions in 2015 to address the complaint of JCPOA critics that, without such a snap-back, the United States would be at the mercy of Russia, China, and perhaps European partners too invested in commerce with Iran to hold Iran accountable for JCPOA violations. These were arguably the most deferential powers the UNSC could put in the hands of the United States—something an “America First”-obsessed president should like. That the United States would not use these powers, even at the expense of another 60 to 80 days in the JCPOA, is surprising. It suggests the president (and perhaps the national security advisor) were so desperate to withdraw the United States from the agreement as fast as possible—and before U.S. and European negotiators found solutions to the diplomatic impasse—that they would be prepared to compromise sanctions re-imposition goals to do so. For the time being, there is little difference between Iran’s compliance (or lack thereof) under UNSCR 2231 as compared to the previous resolutions. In fact, Iran’s nuclear procurement behavior is arguably much better under UNSCR 2231: There have been no confirmed reports of illicit Iranian nuclear procurement since the JCPOA entered into force. And, though it is not particularly comforting to say so, Iran’s noncompliance with its missile and conventional arms prohibitions under UNSCR 2231 is not manifestly different than how it ignored its corresponding obligations under the previous resolutions. For those who believed the UNSC endorsed Iran’s nuclear and missile programs by adopting UNSCR 2231, this decision not to snap back the previous resolutions also ought to be a major blow.  After all, the president had the chance to reestablish the legal prohibition on Iran’s possession of an enrichment program, among other things, to which they credit significant value. These critics’ relative silence on this point suggests that their objections to the UNSC’s dropping of Iran’s requirement to suspend its enrichment and heavy-water related activities from resolution 1737 were more theological than practical. But, in the medium to long term, the decision to forgo UNSC snap-back will be problematic. First of all, a careful read of UNSCR 2231 indicates that the United States can’t invoke the UNSC snap-back procedure now that it is no longer a JCPOA participant. If that is correct, it means that, even in the event of major Iranian nuclear noncompliance, the United States will either have to secure the required votes for reimposing UNSC sanctions under the normal Security Council process—gaining the support of the four other veto-holders—or rely on France or the United Kingdom to trigger snap-back on our behalf. This will constrain future U.S. options. Second, this means that unless other members of the JCPOA trigger snap-back on their own, the prohibitions on transfers of conventional arms- and missile-missiles in UNSCR 2231 will still expire in 2020 and 2023. The United States will retain its ability to go after these transfers unilaterally through its own national authorities (which was the original Obama administration plan), but will have to do so in the potentially compromised sanctions environment that the rash decision to end U.S. participation in the JCPOA may engender. Third, the same will apply to the expiration of the nuclear procurement-related provisions in 2025. But the United States will find it very difficult to intervene to prevent problematic procurements in the meantime: It’s no longer a member of the Joint Commission of the JCPOA, which reviews procurement activities. It will have to rely on the United Kingdom, France, and Germany—which is not necessarily a problem, since they retain a strong interest in denying Iran the ability to obtain items that could help Iran develop a nuclear weapons option or shorten breakout times. But it is hard to believe such a situation would have been considered a reasonable outcome in 2015 when the JCPOA was under such scrutiny. The United States will have the technical ability to block such transfers when reported to the UNSC (as required in Op 16 of UNSCR 2231) but its ability to act will be constrained. The terms of the resolution state that the Joint Commission’s recommendations in this regard will be “deemed to be approved unless the Security Council adopts a resolution to reject a Joint Commission recommendation within five working days of receiving it.” This means that the United States will have to convince at least seven other UNSC members, including the four other veto-holding members, to block such transfers. This seems unlikely in the event of a Joint Commission recommendation to proceed. Fourth, in the absence of snap-back, the United States will lose the authority of the UNSC to induce cooperation with the broader U.S. sanctions agenda and to reestablish the UNSC’s imprimatur over U.S. and partner sanctions in the event of a future contingency. Though the Trump administration may generally hold multilateral institutions in low regard, they played a valuable role in encouraging U.S. partners to follow its lead in imposing their own autonomous sanctions against Iran. UNSCR 1929’s language on oil and gas equipment supporting Iran’s nuclear program, for example, helped the EU, Japan, and South Korea adopt unilateral sanctions against Iran’s energy sector in 2010. Without the ability to invoke UNSC sanctions now, the United States can only push on other countries using its own national tools and threats. This will damage the legitimacy of any resulting sanctions in the eyes of many international actors. It will also remove the veneer of compliance with the U.N. Charter that many countries used to explain at home why they decided to work with the United States on sanctions in the first place. The decision to not snap back UNSC sanctions immediately will allow EU and other states to navigate their own courses with Iran, free of the UNSC obligations that would have been re-imposed under a snap-back scenario. Though this paper has highlighted UNSC sanctions pertaining to the nuclear and missile programs, as well as conventional arms, other UNSC sanctions required increased financial vigilance and denial of services for business with Iran that—in previous EU legislative opinions—required fairly aggressive sanctions steps in the EU. For example, in 2010, the EU adopted a system for reviewing transactions with Iran over various different financial thresholds that were intended to stymie even normal business with Iran, but which was based on language in UNSCR 1929 that required enhanced scrutiny. Under a UNSC snap-back scenario, it is conceivable EU lawyers would have argued that such measures would again be compulsory. For the moment, as a JCPOA advocate, this costs me little sleep, since it increases the chances that Iran is willing to remain in the JCPOA for the time being and, more importantly, the chances that Iran’s nuclear program will remain constrained and intrusively monitored. But, it will harm our efforts to pressure Iran if it decides to break out of the JCPOA in the future, and it does nothing to improve upon the alleged deficiencies in the JCPOA that led to calls for its termination since 2015.

"The Iran Nuclear Deal's Unraveling Raises Fears of Cyberattacks","When the US last tightened its sanctions against Iran in 2012, then-president Barack Obama boasted that they were "virtually grinding the Iranian economy to a halt." Iran fired back with one of the broadest series of cyberattacks ever to target the US, bombarding practically every major American bank with months of intermittent distributed denial of service attacks that pummeled their websites with junk traffic, knocking them offline. Three years later, the Obama administration lifted many of those sanctions in exchange for Iran's promise to halt its nuclear development; Tehran has since mostly restrained its state-sponsored online attacks against Western targets. Now, with little more than a word from President Trump, that détente appears to have ended. And with it, the lull in Iranian cyberattacks on the West may be coming to an end, too. President Trump announced Tuesday that he would unilaterally withdraw the US from the Iran nuclear deal negotiated by the Obama administration in 2015, and impose new sanctions against the country within 90 days. Since then, foreign policy watchers have warned that the move would isolate the US, risk further destabilizing the Middle East, and invite another nuclear rogue nation into the world. But for those who have followed the last decade of digital conflicts around the globe, the unraveling of the Iran deal reignites not only the country's nuclear threat, but also the threat of its highly aggressive hackers—now with years more development and training that have only honed their offensive tactics. "They’ve developed this ability over the last years and there’s no reason for them not to use it now," says Levi Gundert, an Iran-focused analyst at private intelligence firm Recorded Future. "They want to try to induce other countries to think about repercussions before levying sanctions, and they have a real capability in the cyber domain." 'Now all bets are off.' Levi Gundert, Recorded Future For the last decade, the cybersecurity community has watched with growing dismay as Iranian state-sponsored hackers have slowly built up their capabilities and occasionally used them in brazen, chaotic offensive operations that have destroyed data on tens of thousands of computers, and threatened more serious critical infrastructure attacks. The NSA has even warned internally that Iran appears to be learning from the US hacking operations that have at some points targeted the country. But since the 2015 nuclear deal, Iran has largely restricted its hacking to its own neighborhood , repeatedly hitting its longtime rival Saudi Arabia and other Gulf nations with cyberattacks but limiting its attacks on Western targets to mere cyberespionage, not actual disruptive operations. (One exception was the Iranian extortion attack against HBO last summer , whose perpetrator had ties to the Iranian government but seems to have hacked the television network independently.) With the Iran pact crumbling, expect that restraint to evaporate too, warns Gundert. "Most of the destructive attacks were pre-2015. Then we had the Iran deal," he says. "Now all bets are off." Iran's abrupt entrance into the digital arms race came in 2012, when state-sponsored Iranian hackers calling themselves the Cutting Sword of Justice used a piece of malware called Shamoon to overwrite the files of 30,000 machines on the network of energy company Saudi Aramco with a file that displayed the image of a burning American flag. A similar malware infection struck Qatari gas firm RasGas soon after. The attacks, which temporarily paralyzed the IT operations of one of the world's largest oil companies, is widely seen as retaliation for Stuxnet , the NSA- and Israeli-created malware that was unleashed against the Natanz Iranian nuclear facility in 2010 to destroy its enrichment centrifuges. The blitz against American banking websites came the following month. Known as Operation Ababil, the campaign claimed to come in response to an anti-Muslim YouTube video called "the Innocence of Muslims." But the US government interpreted the attacks instead as a retaliatory measure against Stuxnet and escalating sanctions. "It's important to remember that they’ve flexed this muscle before," says John Hultquist, director of research at private intelligence firm FireEye, which has closely tracked Iranian state-sponsored hacking. It's not certain if new sanctions will produce the same response from Iran now, says Rob Knake, a former White House cybersecurity official in the Obama administration who was closely involved in the response to those attacks. He points out that the Obama White House largely brushed off the bank attacks in an effort to get the Iranians to the negotiating table. Iran may fear that the Trump administration and its hawkish national security adviser John Bolton would instead respond in kind. "They might now have a different view of our response if they escalate in cyberspace," Knake says. 'Iranian actors will at least start probing critical infrastructure again, and start on the path toward attack capabilities in the West.' John Hultquist, FireEye But Iran has retaliated for less. In 2014, Iranian hackers used a malware infection to inflict $40 million in data destruction at the Sands Casino in Las Vegas. The casino's owner, vocal pro-Israel billionaire Sheldon Adelson, had made public comments suggesting the US detonate a nuclear bomb in Nevada as a demonstration to Iran of what would happen to the country if it continued pursuit of its nuclear weapons program. After the devastating attack on the Sands, attackers calling themselves "the Anti-WMD Team" left behind a message on the casino's computers reading "Encouraging the use of Weapons of Mass Destruction, UNDER ANY CONDITION, is a Crime." Beyond mere data destruction, Iran has developed more sophisticated infrastructure hacking abilities, too. In 2014, the security firm Cylance revealed that an Iranian state-sponsored hacking group known as Cleaver had broadly penetrated critical infrastructure targets from Pakistani airports to Turkish oil and gas companies to US chemical industry targets and energy firms. "We believe that if the operation is left to continue unabated, it is only a matter of time before the world’s physical safety is impacted by it," the Cylance report read . Now, FireEye's Hultquist warns the end of the nuclear deal will likely trigger a restart of those intrusions. "We anticipate with the agreement going away that the Iranian actors will at least start probing critical infrastructure again, and start on the path toward attack capabilities in the West," he says. Some still-unconfirmed signs suggest that Iran may be developing the ability to not only disrupt critical infrastructure with cyberattacks, but to destroy it. A highly sophisticated malware known as Trisis or Triton hit Saudi Aramco last year, and is designed to manipulate the company's physical safety equipment, with potentially lethal results. (Instead it merely caused a plant to shut down.) That attack hasn't been tied to Iran, though its Saudi targeting has made the country the first suspect—and would hint that Iran's technical hacking abilities are further along than anyone had otherwise seen. All of that suggests that Iran may have quietly grown into a serious threat to any enemy nation that it can reach via the internet. And now that the last three years of tense peace appears to be ending, its list of fair-game targets may once again include the United States, too. Today’s bombs are smaller in size but more powerful. They are also more likely to be delivered via intercontinental ballistic missiles, rather than dropped from aircraft. Here's how they've evolved into weapons that could wipe out entire cities. CNMN Collection © 2018 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

"Confronting Iran","MICHAEL R. POMPEO is U.S. Secretary of State. The end of the Cold War forced new thinking among policymakers and analysts about the greatest challenges to U.S. national security. The emergence of al Qaeda, cybercriminals , and other dangerous entities affirmed the threat of nonstate actors. But equally daunting has been the resurgence of outlaw regimes—rogue states that defy international norms, fail to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms, and act against the security of the American people, U.S. allies and partners, and the rest of the world. Chief among these outlaw regimes are North Korea and Iran. Their transgressions against international peace are many, but both nations are most notorious for having spent decades pursuing nuclear weapons programs in violation of international prohibitions. Despite Washington’s best efforts at diplomacy, Pyongyang hoodwinked U.S. policymakers with a string of broken arms control agreements going back to the George H. W. Bush administration. North Korea’s nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs continued apace, to the point where after Donald Trump was elected, President Barack Obama told him that this would be his greatest national security challenge. With Iran, likewise, the deal that the Obama administration struck in 2015—the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA—failed to end the country’s nuclear ambitions. In fact, because Iran knew that the Obama administration would prioritize preserving the deal over everything else, the JCPOA created a sense of impunity on the part of the regime, allowing it to increase its support for malign activity. The deal has also given Tehran piles of money, which the supreme leader has used to sponsor all types of terrorism throughout the Middle East (with few consequences in response) and which have boosted the economic fortunes of a regime that remains bent on exporting its revolution abroad and imposing it at home. That the threats from North Korea and Iran grew in the post–Iraq war era has further complicated the question of how best to counteract them; Americans are rightly skeptical of Loading, please wait...

"As Trump mulls the Iran deal’s fate, a three-ring circus ensues","With fewer than two weeks to go before the deadline for an American decision on continuing the Iran nuclear agreement, the debate over the fate the deal has become a three-ring circus, with Israelis, Europeans, and the Iranians themselves all jockeying to shape the outcome in their own favor. At this point, only two things are clear: President Donald Trump is reveling in his role of ringmaster, entertaining appeals from U.S. allies and holding the world in suspense while he ostensibly deliberates over a choice with massive national security and economic implications. As he has routinely reminded visiting dignitaries and the listening press corps, this momentous decision will be his and his alone. And the chaotic state of play suggests that the upcoming deadline for sustaining U.S. compliance with the agreement may serve as a beginning, rather than an end—the opening of a new phase of uncertainty and possibly even diplomacy. Trump will issue his verdict on the Iran deal next week, but the decision will likely usher in an even more intense ambiguity surrounding the status of the nuclear agreement, the state of the trans-Atlantic relationship, the legality of doing business with Iran, and the prospects for military conflict involving Tehran and its proxies across the Middle East. The latest act under the big top played out in Tel Aviv, where Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu shared what was hyped as “dramatic news” about Iran’s nuclear program. In a memorable live televised address from Israeli military headquarters, Netanyahu unveiled a treasure trove of apparently original documentation of Iran’s nuclear program and proclaimed that Tehran had lied “big time” about its nuclear activities. Netanyahu gave a characteristically theatrical performance, pulling back curtains to reveal stacks of files from what he described as half a ton of archival material on Iran’s nuclear program that Israeli operatives extracted from a Tehran warehouse in what appears to have been a fascinating intelligence coup. The archives’ actual revelations…were less dazzling. The archives’ actual revelations, however, were less dazzling. Despite the prime minister’s breathless pronouncement, the cache of Iranian documents has thus far divulged little more than what we already widely knew—that Iran’s nuclear program was never intended for the generation of civilian energy for peaceful purposes, as Tehran claimed, but rather for the pursuit of a nuclear weapons capability. That should come as no surprise to all but the most naïve consumers of Iran’s persistent denials. In fact, the wide recognition of the threat posed by Iran’s nuclear program precipitated unprecedented international sanctions and ultimately the nuclear accord. However, Netanyahu was not aiming to shape the views of those already acquainted with the long history of the Iran nuclear crisis or its seeming resolution with the 2015 nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Rather, his statement was orchestrated to reinforce Trump’s frequently expressed misgivings about the agreement and about Iran. Standing before a screen emblazoned with the phrase “Iran lied” in three-foot-tall type, the Israeli prime minister deftly juxtaposed public statements by Iranian officials insisting on the nuclear program’s peaceful intent with the official acknowledgements throughout the Iranian archives that this was always a ruse. For Trump, this presentation served as confirmation of his deeply held conviction that Iran cannot be trusted and that Tehran diabolically hoodwinked the Obama administration and its diplomatic partners into a fundamentally unfair deal. Echoing the president’s description last week of the JCPOA as “a terrible deal,” Netanyahu transparently egged on Trump’s opposition to it, adding that “I’m sure he’ll do the right thing” in his decision next week about the future of the agreement. Netanyahu’s message clearly resonated with Trump, and it may well have tipped the scales for a president already inclined to walk away from the agreement at the upcoming deadline. But it did little to actually undermine the case for the deal itself; in fact, his detailed description of Iran’s past record of hiding its nuclear activities only underscores the value of the robust monitoring and verification regime that the JCPOA erected and that will be put in jeopardy if the United States takes steps to unravel the agreement. The deal was never predicated on trust in Iran—just the opposite: American negotiators, with their European, Russian, and Chinese partners devised an unprecedented array of oversight mechanisms within the framework of the JCPOA to serve as an ironclad defense against a renewed Iranian nuclear weapons program. Should Trump repudiate the nuclear deal, there is no reason to believe that Tehran will continue to submit to international monitoring or to sustain the constraints on its nuclear program as required under the accord. The deal was never predicated on trust in Iran—just the opposite. Netanyahu’s gambit followed on the heels of a pair of high-level European visits to Washington that aimed at persuading Trump to stop short of unraveling the nuclear deal. French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel sought to build on months of working-level negotiations on measures to strengthen the provisions of the nuclear deal, as Trump had demanded in January. The talks had made some headway at defining ways to address Iran’s missile capabilities, strengthen the deal’s inspections regime, and extend the lifespan of its restrictions on Iran’s nuclear activities. Still, the months of diplomatic legwork had only exposed the seemingly insurmountable divergence between Trump’s determination to revise the nuclear deal’s central premise—Iran’s acceptance of temporary constraints on its activities in exchange for economic benefits—and the Europeans’ equal resolve to preserve and uphold the existing arrangement. Neither Macron nor Merkel succeeded in making a breakthrough in the stalemate over the terms of a supplemental agreement. Still, the French president sought to salvage some opening for multilateral diplomacy on Iran. In doing so, like Netanyahu, Macron openly played to Trump’s ego in importuning the president during a joint press conference at the White House, saying: “We should not tear apart JCPOA and have nothing else—that would not be a good solution.” Instead, Macron proposed a “new deal” in language that evoked Trump’s long experience in real estate—“building something new that will cover all concerns.” That possibility also seemed to strike a chord with the president, who mused : “I think we will have a shot to be a much bigger deal. … We’ll know fairly soon.”   Related Content             Order from Chaos  Trump, promising hellfire in Syria, blinked. Why that could bode well for the Iran deal   Suzanne Maloney  Wednesday, April 18, 2018              Order from Chaos  Trump’s new national security team likely spells disaster for the Iran nuclear deal   Suzanne Maloney  Monday, April 2, 2018       Trump’s cryptic public statements and the dueling supplication of Israeli and European leaders (as well as a spate of public comments by his own advisers ) underscore that the outcome of the upcoming decision on the deal remains fluid. Trump must balance his loathing of the nuclear agreement with his instinctive aversion to military entanglements in the Middle East and the tantalizing prospect that he might steer some more ambitious course for “a much bigger deal” on Iran. This would be the longest of long shots. Any pivot from an American abrogation of an existing accord to a much more elaborate diplomatic scheme for addressing the broad scope of international concerns about Iran’s foreign and domestic policies would require Olympian ingenuity—a quality that is in particularly short supply for the current administration. And crafting an expanded platform for negotiations would necessitate Iranian restraint in the face of pressure and perhaps even renewed engagement with Washington—in other words, an almost inconceivable embrace of practicality over ideology by the Iranian leadership, whose engrained paranoia has only been confirmed and intensified by the American about-face on the nuclear deal. Still, under almost any circumstances, Trump’s decision on the deal will lead the world into uncharted waters, with few alternatives that are more attractive than Hail Mary diplomacy and with a brief interlude that will be ripe for diplomatic damage control. With little evidence that the Trump administration has prepared for a smooth re-imposition of sanctions, even an unqualified repudiation of the deal on May 12 would entail some pause for necessary diplomatic and bureaucratic groundwork. The framework for dispute resolution within the JCPOA would also offer an opportunity of as much as 30 days for adjudicating any complaint about U.S. adherence to the agreement. However Trump plays the upcoming deadline, the due date for another set of sanctions waivers looms in mid-July, which would add urgency to any effort to avert escalation. In the abstract, trying to fix the weaknesses in the existing nuclear agreement by devising a new diplomatic framework that would seek to overcome decades of mutual grievances and Tehran’s deep investment in ideological and operational antagonism to U.S. interests and allies seems like a preposterous approach. But in the words of another Donald (Rumsfeld), you go to war with the army you have, not the one you wish to have. Instead of writing eulogies for the deal that was, defenders of the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement must begin strategizing around the diplomacy that could be. There are few other viable options that offer at least a chance of averting an unchecked Iranian nuclear program in the hands of a leadership determined to escalate its conflict with Washington.

"The Economist explains","by M.S. When and how did these talks begin? Talks that led to a breakthrough interim agreement agreed in November of 2013, known both as the Geneva Accord and the Joint Plan of Action, began in February of that year . Prior to that there had been numerous (unsuccessful) attempts to negotiate a deal with Iran since 2002 when Iranian dissident groups raised the alarm over the country’s nuclear programme by revealing the existence of two facilities that had not been declared to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN’s nuclear watchdog. Two things have given the current talks real momentum, however. The first was a back channel to Iran opened up by the Obama administration in March 2013 that led to several secret bilateral meetings in Oman. The second was the election in June of 2013 of Hassan Rohani, who 10 years before had served as Iran’s nuclear negotiator, on a platform promising constructive engagement with the international community aimed at lifting harsh economic sanctions and ending Iran's international isolation. The negotiations leading to Thursday’s pact kicked off in March 2014. Several deadlines for a comprehensive agreement were extended. The final deadline has now been set for July 1st of this year, but the White House needed a detailed framework agreement to be in place well before the return of Congress from its Easter break, in order to head off an attempt by Republican critics of any deal with Iran to legislate for new sanctions and thus kill off the talks. Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks. Who are the P5+1? Why not call it the P6? The P5+1 are America, France, Britain, China, Russia and Germany. The first five are all permanent members of the UN Security Council. Germany is there because it was part of an EU3 including France and Britain, that held an earlier series of negotiations with Iran. The European Union is also represented at the talks by its foreign affairs supremo. The UN Security Council has passed a series of resolutions imposing sanctions on Iran since 2006 following reports by the IAEA regarding Iran's non-compliance with its safeguards agreement under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Sanctions were first imposed when Iran rejected the Security Council’s demand that Iran suspend all uranium enrichment-related and reprocessing activities. What did they hope to get out of a deal? In short, the P5+1 wants to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, or at least to stop it from being able to get one either very quickly or clandestinely. To that end the negotiators have compromised over allowing Iran to continue to enrich uranium, concluding that complete dismantling of a huge infrastructure was unrealistic. However, they have sought strict limits on Iran’s enrichment programme, the redesign of a plutonium-producing heavy water reactor under construction and a highly-intrusive inspection regime to prevent cheating. Their aim has been to extend Iran’s “breakout capability”—the key yardstick of the time needed to produce enough fissile material for one nuclear weapon — from the current estimate of a couple of months to at least a year, and to maintain it there for a decade or more. What did Iran hope to receive? For Iran, the pressing need is to gain relief from sanctions that have ratcheted up in severity and are having a crippling effect on its resource-dependent economy. In particular, restrictions on its oil and gas exports, its ability to import technology to exploit its energy resources, and being cut off from SWIFT, the financial-messaging system used to transfer money between the world’s banks, have taken an increasing toll. Iran would have liked all sanctions to end from the moment of a deal being signed, but relief will be staged on the basis of good faith implementation of whatever limits on the nuclear programme are finally agreed. Sanctions related to other aspects of Iran’s behaviour, such as human-rights issues, support of terrorism and its ballistic-missile programme will not be affected. Furthermore, Mr Obama can only suspend sanctions that Congress has legislated. What does the deal actually include? The agreement announced on Thursday night was more detailed than most expected , but nothing is in place until a formal deal is signed before the July 1st deadline. However, under this statement of intent Iran will reduce its installed enrichment centrifuges from 19,000 to 6,000, only 5,000 of which will be spinning. All of them will be first-generation centrifuges: none of its more advanced models can be used for at least 10 years, and R&D into more efficient designs will have to be based on a plan submitted to the IAEA. Fordow, Iran’s second enrichment facility (its main one is at Natanz) which is buried deep within a mountain and thought to be impregnable to conventional air strikes, will cease all enrichment and be turned into a physics research centre. It will not produce or house any fissile material for at least 15 years. Iran has said it will reduce its stockpile of low-enriched uranium (which can be spun further into weapons-grade material) from 10,000kg to 300kg for the next 15 years. Iran’s alternative plutonium path to a bomb also appears to have been satisfactorily dealt with. The heavy-water reactor at Arak will be redesigned and its original core, which would have produced significant quantities of weapons-grade plutonium, will be removed and destroyed. No other heavy-water reactor will be built for 15 years. All these undertakings hinge on the assurance that Iran will abide by them. Without a uniquely intrusive inspection and verification regime, sceptics would still be right to question their worth given Iran’s past history of lying and cheating over its nuclear programme. Under the terms of the framework agreement, inspectors from the IAEA will be able to inspect any facility, declared or otherwise, as long as it is deemed to be “suspicious”. The agreement also states that Iran will address the IAEA’s concerns about what it calls the Possible Military Dimensions (PMDs) of its nuclear programme. Such powers for the IAEA, which will remain in place indefinitely, are a lot more sweeping than those it has under the normal safeguard agreements that are part of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. What needs to happen by July 1st? Basically, a lot more of the technical detail needs to be filled in. The exact nature of the inspection and verification regime is especially important as are the penalties for non-compliance (such as automatic snapback of US and EU sanctions and new UN resolutions). Because the framework agreement was so specific, some of the heavy lifting has been done. But the negotiator’s watchword is that until everything is agreed, nothing is agreed. Who is hoping the deal falls apart? What are the odds they get their wish? The deal has many strenuous critics. The Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, has described it in almost apocalyptic terms (although much of Israel’s security establishment is more sanguine about it); Republican hawks in Congress (and even some Democrats) hate the idea of any deal with Iran that does nothing to address its behaviour as a troublemaker in the Middle East and as a sponsor of designated terrorist outfits, such as Hizbullah in Lebanon. The deal is also opposed by hardliners in Tehran who may still be hoping to win over the enigmatic but ailing supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, to their point of view. Elements of the powerful Iranian Revolutionary Guard (IRG), who control military sites which the IAEA will have to gain access to if it is to address the vital PMD issues, may be quite happy to find a way of sabotaging the deal. The IRG may even wish to see sanctions remain in place, as they have provided money-making opportunities for many of its leaders. However, the problem faced by those who would like to see the deal collapse is that they have yet to offer any attractive alternatives. Ordinary Iranians are desperate to get back to having a normal economy, while American voters have little appetite for going to war with Iran to prevent it getting a nuclear weapon. According to a Washington Post- ABC News poll conducted just before the agreement on April 2nd was announced, Americans support the notion of striking a deal with Iran that restricts the nation’s nuclear program in exchange for loosening sanctions, by a nearly two to one margin . If the deal holds together, what does that mean for the Middle East? That is hard to say. Overall, if the deal does what it is meant to, it should make the region a bit safer, heading off, at least for now, the prospect of a dangerous nuclear arms race involving Saudi Arabia and perhaps Egypt and Turkey as well. Israel will surely be more secure if Iran’s breakout capability is extended to over a year from just a month or so and its whole nuclear programme becomes vastly more transparent. What a deal is most unlikely to do, at least in the short-term, is to make Iran a more cooperative, less aggrandising player in the region’s geopolitics . If Iran feels richer, there is a risk it may actually interfere more. This is an arms-control deal between adversaries, not a friendship hug. Interests will continue to diverge between Iran and the West. Just possibly, however, if Iran’s economy becomes re-integrated with the world, and a degree of trust is established on all sides by Iran's meeting the obligations they have signed up to, something more fruitful could eventually emerge.

"Trump Takes Aim at Kerry — Again — Ahead of Announcement on Iran Deal","Advertisement Supported by Fact Check By  Linda Qiu WASHINGTON — President Trump is again warning John Kerry, the former secretary of state, to keep out of discussions over whether to remain in the Iran nuclear deal — a decision the White House is expected to announce on Tuesday . John Kerry can’t get over the fact that he had his chance and blew it! Stay away from negotiations John, you are hurting your country! A day earlier, the president accused Mr. Kerry, who helped broker the 2015 nuclear deal, of engaging in “possibly illegal Shadow Diplomacy” — a charge disputed by some legal scholars who say the same characterization could have applied to Mr. Trump when he was a candidate. The United States does not need John Kerry’s possibly illegal Shadow Diplomacy on the very badly negotiated Iran Deal.  He was the one that created this MESS in the first place! The 2015 accord among world powers limited Tehran’s nuclear program in exchange for lifting international sanctions against Iran. A parade of European diplomats have in recent weeks urged the Trump administration not to abandon the agreement. Mr. Kerry has also been trying to save it . He has strategized with Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif of Iran, met with European officials and lobbied members of Congress. Mr. Trump did not specify what was illegal about Mr. Kerry’s actions, and the White House would not comment. But Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer, accused Mr. Kerry of “violating the Logan Act,” adding, “And nobody seems to care.” As The New York Times’s Charlie Savage has previously explained : The Logan Act is a 1799 statute that bars private citizens from interfering with diplomatic relations between the United States and foreign governments. It makes it a felony, punishable by a fine or imprisonment of up to three years, if an American citizen, without government authorization, interacts “with any foreign government or any officer or agent thereof, with intent to influence the measures or conduct of any foreign government or of any officer or agent thereof, in relation to any disputes or controversies with the United States, or to defeat the measures of the United States.” A spokesman for Mr. Kerry declined to comment on Monday on Mr. Trump’s charges of illegality. A statement released by Mr. Kerry’s office said he “stays in touch with his former counterparts around the world just like every previous secretary of state.” “Like America’s closest allies,” the statement said, “he believes it is important that the nuclear agreement, which took the world years to negotiate, remain effective as countries focus on stability in the region.” It appears that whether Mr. Kerry violated the law is a matter of legal interpretation. Since the Iran deal is still in place — as of Monday — Mr. Kerry has not undermined or opposed American foreign policy, said Daniel Rice, a fellow at the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection at Georgetown University. “Because the Trump administration has not yet decided to reimpose sanctions on Iran, the existing nuclear deal framework — and not its repudiation — is currently a ‘measure of the United States,’” Mr. Rice said. “By attempting to salvage the deal, Kerry plainly did not intend to ‘defeat’ a measure of the United States.” But it also depends on exactly what Mr. Kerry said to the foreign officials, said Eric Posner, a law professor at the University of Chicago. “If he has gone further than merely expressing his opinion, and tried to influence the actions of foreign governments by, for example, making promises on behalf of a future Democratic president or Congress, and these promises are credible, there is an arguable Logan Act violation,” Mr. Posner said. The legal scholars interviewed by The Times all stressed that the law is a paper tiger that has never been seriously enforced. (Two said it may be unconstitutional.) Still, the Logan Act has occasionally resurfaced as a political cudgel. While it’s “perfectly plausible” to argue that Mr. Kerry violated the Logan Act, “it’s been violated hundreds of times” with no repercussions, said Michael McConnell, a law professor at Stanford University. Accused violators include Henry A. Wallace , the former vice president who lobbied against the Truman Doctrine; Jane Fonda , the actress who traveled to Hanoi during the Vietnam War; the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson , the civil rights activist who visited Cuba during a presidential campaign against Ronald Reagan; and 47 Republican senators who wrote to the government of Iran in 2015 to oppose the nuclear deal before it was struck. The law resurfaced again last year, when it was revealed that Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump’s first national security adviser, had discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador in late 2016 — before the president’s inauguration. And Mr. Trump himself may have committed the same offense as Mr. Kerry when, during the 2016 campaign, he invited Russia to hack Hillary Clinton’s emails , said Timothy Zick, a law professor at the College of William and Mary. (The suggestion of a Logan Act violation did emerge at the time .) But given that there have been no prosecutions under the Logan Act in its history, scholars said it’s hard to predict whether Mr. Kerry would be convicted — even if a case was brought against him. The Logan Act has “been a dead letter for hundreds of years,” Mr. McConnell said. “Its only function is mischief.” Advertisement","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/07/us/politics/trump-kerry-iran-nuclear-deal-illegal.html"
"India-Iran Rice-For-Oil Deal Not Modi Magic, It’s a UPA-Era Scheme","“ Starting 4 November 2018, India will send rice to Iran in the exchange of crude oil. With this modern form of the old fashioned barter system, our dependence on the American dollar will be less and our Indian rupee will get a new life. Modi magic transforming India! ” This message has been posted by Priti Gandhi, who describes herself on Twitter as ‘National In-charge of Social Media- BJP Mahila Morcha’. Gandhi has a significant following of over 3,21,000 and is followed on the platform by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The fake news website Postcard  News published an article extolling this ‘masterstroke’ by PM Modi. It was also tweeted by Mahesh Vikram Hegde, founder of the website. The claim that this is a unique initiative by the Modi government to circumvent currency-related restrictions on trade has also been shared by several individual users on Facebook. From 4 November, US sanctions on the Iranian oil sector will come into effect, obstructing payment avenues to the oil-rich nation. Relations between the US and Iran have been on a downward spiral ever since US President Donald Trump reimposed economic sanctions on Iran after his country withdrew from the nuclear deal framework agreement reached in 2015. With the Indian government reportedly mulling rupee-based trade with Iran, sympathisers of the ruling party are on an overdrive to project this move as ‘Modi magic’. An alternate payment system was devised by Iran and India in the wake of previous sanctions on the West Asian nation. In an ingenious workaround, Iran had agreed to accept payment for oil exports in rupees. The Indian currency earned by Iran could be redeemed to import goods and commodities from India including rice, textiles, tea, coffee and pharmaceutical products. It is worthwhile to note here that the rice-for-oil trade between the two countries is not barter in the literal sense. The rupee-based trading system devised for commercial exchange with Iran is not an initiative of the Modi government. In fact, it was first introduced in 2012 when Iran had borne the brunt of economic sanctions imposed by the Western nations over its nuclear programme. News reports by Times of India , The Hindu and  Live Mint had referred to the payment mechanism that had been threshed out by the two countries. In a report of February 2012, Live Mint had quoted the then Iranian ambassador to India who had stated that 45 percent of the payment will be in Indian currency, which would be utilised by Iran to pay for imports from India. In March 2013, a report by Reuters had highlighted how Iran’s oil revenue was helping Indian rice exporters regain their business which had suffered due to imposition of sanctions. The mechanism was in place till 2015, when payment for Iranian oil was guaranteed in rupees. With the lifting of sanctions in 2015, the two nations had reverted to the traditional mode of exchange. The Islamic Republic of Iran’s nuclear enrichment programme pursued vigorously in the first decade of the new millenium had culminated in a concerted effort led by the US and EU, seeking to cripple Iran with economic sanctions in view of the deadlock that had emerged in negotiations. Iran was accused of clandestinely enriching uranium for military use, a charge Iran vehemently denies, stating that its programme is purely for civilian purposes. The nation’s banking sector was targeted in 2012 – Iran had been locked out of SWIFT – the global transaction network which allowed cross-border transactions with foreign banks. The impasse was broken with the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action , a framework nuclear agreement between Iran, the five permanent members of the UNSC, Germany and the European Union (EU) which lifted restrictions on export of Iranian oil and Iranian funds frozen abroad. This year, the US reneged on the the framework nuclear agreement and reimposed sanctions. This has once again resulted in an arrangement between India and Iran that will guarantee Iranian oil for Indian currency. According to reports, the Indian government is considering a similar arrangement with Russia and Venezuela.

"Trump will pull out of Iran nuclear deal, leading senator predicts","Sun 18 Mar 2018 16.01 GMT   Last modified on Thu 5 Jul 2018 21.46 BST   The chair of the Senate foreign relations committee has predicted Donald Trump will pull the US out of the nuclear deal with Iran . “The Iran deal will be another issue that’s coming up in May, and right now it doesn’t feel like it’s going to be extended,” Bob Corker told CBS’s Face the Nation in an interview broadcast on Sunday. “I think the president likely will move away from it, unless our European counterparts really come together on a framework. And it doesn’t feel to me that they are. Now, as we get within two weeks of the 12 May date, that could change.” Corker also said he did not think such a move would damage attempts to set up a meeting the same month between Trump and Kim Jong-un, the dictator of nuclear-armed North Korea. The Tennessee senator has clashed repeatedly with Trump and will retire in November. He has been touted in some quarters as a presidential rival in 2020 . In his CBS interview, he said: “This whole situation with North Korea … is somewhat unorthodox, and I think you’re dealing with a leader there that probably doesn’t think the same way that other countries and their leadership might. So I’m not sure that [ending the Iran deal] is gonna end up having a detrimental effect.” Trump has long opposed the 2015 deal, which curtails Tehran’s development of nuclear weapons in return for sanctions relief, partly because his predecessor in the White House, Barack Obama, regarded it as a signature achievement. This week Trump fired the secretary of state, Rex Tillerson , a defender of the deal, and nominated the CIA director, Mike Pompeo, to replace him. “I wanted to either break it or do something and he felt a little bit differently,” Trump told reporters. “So we were not really thinking the same. With Mike, Mike Pompeo, we have a very similar thought process.” Trump is also reported to be close to replacing the national security adviser, HR McMaster, another defender of the deal, with the former Bush UN ambassador John Bolton, a hawk who favours pre-emptive military action. Corker said he thought Pompeo had a good chance of being confirmed by his committee, even though Rand Paul of Kentucky has said he will vote no . Paul spoke to CNN’s State of the Union. “I don’t think you really want people who are eager for war to be running the state department,” he said. “You want a diplomat.” Pompeo, he said, was “too much of an advocate for regime change, really everywhere” and was not a “good fit to be a diplomat”. Paul is also opposed to the appointment of Gina Haspel as Pompeo’s successor at the CIA. He told CBS there was “no evidence [Haspel] was protesting against torture” when she oversaw “enhanced interrogation” under the Bush administration. “There’s every evidence she was covering it up ,” he said. Tillerson, Corker said, was “doing fine” despite reportedly having been fired in an undignified manner: the White House chief of staff, John Kelly, claimed Tillerson took a warning call from him while on the toilet, and Tillerson then learned of the final decision by tweet. Corker added that he thought Trump “likes to hear diverse opinions”. “But once a decision is made,” he said, “I think [Trump] likes to see it move along quickly. And I think that was one of the frustrations he may have had with Secretary Tillerson.”","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/18/trump-iran-nuclear-deal-bob-corker"
"","Michael Flynn, who is awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty to unrelated charges of lying to the FBI, has acknowledged he advised a subsidiary of IP3 about its nuclear plan. | Saul Loebb/AFP/Getty Images  Congress By ZACK COLMAN A  consulting firm once linked to former national security adviser Michael Flynn is continuing to push President Donald Trump to endorse a plan to build nuclear reactors in Saudi Arabia, despite warnings from whistleblowers that their earlier efforts appeared to violate U.S. law,  House Democrats said in a report Tuesday. The consultants from the firm  IP3 International, which organized a White House meeting between  the president and nuclear industry executives last week, were involved in pushing a "Middle East Marshall Plan" in the early days of the Trump administration that sparked concerns about Flynn's conflicts of interest. That plan would have involved building dozens of nuclear reactors across the region, in a way that would have circumvented U.S. laws designed to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. Story Continued Below Flynn, who is awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty to unrelated charges of lying to the FBI, has acknowledged he advised a subsidiary of IP3 about its nuclear plan. "The whistleblowers who came forward have expressed significant concerns about the potential procedural and legal violations connected with rushing through a plan to transfer nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia," the report prepared for Democrats on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee  said. In addition, the panel said, "They have warned of conflicts of interest among top White House advisers that could implicate federal criminal statutes." The report does not indicate IP3 did anything illegal, but it is the most thorough accounting to date of how the firm used its connections to advance its concept through potentially conflicted Trump administration officials. Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time. The report's release comes amid the Trump administration's efforts to beat out competitors from Russia and China to develop multibillion-dollar nuclear power plants in Saudi Arabia — and after Trump drew sharp criticism for downplaying Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's role in the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul last year. And it comes ahead of a trip by Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and adviser, to the Middle East later this month to discuss economic development. IP3 organized a meeting with Trump last week where executives from companies such as Westinghouse, General Electric, Exelon, Centrus Energy, NuScale, TerraPower and LightBridge pitched the president to help them win contracts in the Middle East and elsewhere. The Trump administration is already on board with that effort, and Energy Secretary Rick Perry traveled to Saudi Arabia as recently as December to discuss a nuclear power deal, including developing a so-called 123 agreement that would limit the Saudi nuclear program to civilian uses. That 123 agreement, named for a section of the U.S. Atomic Energy Act, is designed to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, an increasing source of tensions in the Middle East following Trump's decision to pull out of the Iranian nuclear pact. Salman has said the kingdom would quickly move to develop nuclear weaponsif Tehran succeeded in obtaining them. But IP3 executives were preparing to move ahead with a deal to build nuclear plants in Saudi Arabia without  an agreement to limit the country's program to a civilian energy production, according to the House report. Based on accounts  and documents provided by whistleblowers, the report said one of IP3’s top officials delivered the firm's nuclear plan to Flynn on Jan. 28, 2017  to pass along to Trump, and another document at the same time for Trump to recommend to the National Security Council. The firm kept pushing its idea through various channels even though political and career officials warned it circumvented national security protocol. In another letter to Salman, IP3's co-founders boasted of the inroads the firm had made with the Trump administration, even after the president forced Flynn out in February 2017 for lying to Vice President Mike Pence about his contacts with Russia. Three of the officials who signed the letter — retired Gen. Jack Keane, retired Rear Adm. Michael Hewitt and former Reagan administration national security adviser Robert “Bud” McFarlane — attended last week’s meeting with Trump. “The agreements by President Trump and Mohammed bin Salman have established the framework for our unique opportunity to take the next steps with IP3 and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,” Keane, Hewitt, McFarlane and retired Gen. Keith Alexander wrote in a March 17, 2017, letter to the crown prince.  Legal By JOSH GERSTEIN Also pressing the case for the Saudi plan at the White House were former NSC official Derek Harvey, as well as Trump confidant Tom Barrack — who has major business ties in the Middle East — and ex-Trump deputy campaign manager Rick Gates, a former Paul Manafort associate who has since pleaded guilty to conspiring against the United States and making false statements. But whistleblowers warned the White House against the nuclear plan. One unidentified official in the Democrats' report  told NSC staff they “absolutely should not include the issue” in Trump’s briefing materials and called IP3’s plan “a scheme for these generals to make some money.” Now, with a civilian nuclear program push gaining steam at the White House, security experts have raised concerns about the process, and the re-emergence of IP3 similarly troubled them. “I see a problem that the Trump administration is giving time to IP3 and their ideas,” said Chen Kane, director of the Middle East nonproliferation program at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, in an interview with POLITICO. “The fact that the people previously pushing this scheme got the meeting with the president after all their attempts to get meetings elsewhere throughout the administration is suspicious,” said a former senior congressional staffer who worked on nuclear matters. The White House and IP3 did not immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday. IP3 has repeatedly denied that it ever employed or paid Flynn in any capacity despite the fact Flynn listed that he served as an adviser to its subsidiary, IronBridge Group Inc., on his financial disclosure. “Mike Flynn was never in IP3, he was never paid by IP3, he never advised IP3, he never had a stake in IP3,” Hewitt told POLITICO after last week’s meeting with Trump. IP3 officials, however, acknowledge they have a relationship with Flynn and that they continue to support efforts to build reactors in the Middle East. McFarlane said they were all connected through ACU Strategic Partners, a company that for years  had pushed a similar idea of building nuclear reactors in the Middle East through a consortium of companies. McFarlane said he, Hewitt and others left ACU when its managing partner, Andrew Copson, suggested they partner with Russia for the project. “Mike [Flynn] then was chosen, appointed to the job in the Trump administration and it’s fair to say we had — IP3 as individuals —  had said, 'Mike, we’re not up for working with Russia,'” McFarlane, who described his role at ACU as “participating in meetings,” told POLITICO last week. The report released Tuesday covers a period through March 2017, which the committee acknowledged was a narrow time frame. But its contents underscore experts’ worries that Flynn and his administration allies are continuing to push for a rushed and politically compromised  nuclear cooperation deal with Saudi Arabia.  white house By DARREN SAMUELSOHN Those security and ethical quandaries compelled NSC legal adviser John Eisenberg to issue a directive stopping all work on the IP3 nuclear plant proposal and the Middle East Marshall Plan concept, the report said. Another source familiar with IP3’s activities during  this period separately told POLITICO that NSC staff were forbidden from meeting with IP3 officials. “According to the whistleblowers, on March 24, 2017, multiple employees raised to the NSC Legal Advisor their concerns, including a detailed description of reported unethical and potentially illegal actions by General Flynn and Mr. Harvey,” the report said. “In response to these concerns, National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster reportedly informed NSC staff that they should cease working on the IP3 proposal. However, NSC staff remained concerned because the same individuals continued their work on IP3’s proposal.” McFarlane told POLITICO that around that time, it became "impossible" to get meetings with NSC officials. McFarlane sent the firm's nuclear expansion plan to Flynn and deputy national security adviser K.T. McFarland on Jan. 28, 2017, eight days after Trump's inauguration. It was a ghost-written memo from Flynn to Trump and another draft memo “for the president to sign” directing other agencies to give Barrack the lead on implementing IP3’s plan. “Tom Barrack has been thoroughly briefed on this strategy and wants to run it for you. He’s perfect for the job. Rex and Jim are supportive of Tom’s focus on this also,” the draft memorandum with Flynn’s name on it said. “Rex” and “Jim” apparently referred to then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. “In the enclosed memo you would call upon the relevant cabinet officers to lend their support to this historic program. I recommend that you sign it,” the memo continued. IP3 has its eyes on Saudi Arabia’s plans to build two nuclear reactors, as it hopes the companies it collaborates with could provide security training, workforce development and other services should a U.S. firm land the contract, McFarlane said. He said IP3 has “no formal relationships” with companies. Westinghouse Electric Co., considered the only U.S. firm that could readily build reactors, is in the running for a Saudi contract. But Saudi Arabia has stymied the efforts by refusing  to sign an International Atomic Energy Agency protocol to permit expanded inspections beyond verifying the location of nuclear material. The U.S. has never signed a 123 agreement  with a nation that hasn’t committed to that step. Saudi Arabia also has said it won’t forswear uranium enrichment and reprocessing, the steps necessary to make nuclear weapons. The United Arab Emirates inked a 123 agreement with such a provision. But Saudi Arabia noted that  the Iran nuclear deal that Trump walked away from did not forever ban that country from those steps, as the terms were due to sunset after 2031. That’s put U.S. negotiators in a tight spot. “The U.S. has an interest in not seeing the expansion of enrichment and reprocessing technology in the region. It would be a mistake to compromise these principles too far,” said Thomas Countryman, who was President Barack Obama’s top arms control and nuclear proliferation official at the State Department. He nonetheless called the interest from U.S. nuclear companies in building Saudi reactors “a natural partnership” given the nations’ long-standing economic relationship.

"The Path of Broke Nuclear Agreements","Unlike North Korea today, Iran does not possess a single nuclear weapon. By trashing the Iran deal, President Trump risks turning Iran into North Korea. President Donald Trump, at the urging of National Security Advisor John Bolton, has withdrawn from the Iran nuclear agreement, putting the future of the deal in jeopardy. Trump did this despite the fact that Iran is in compliance with the deal, that the deal has served to shrink Iran’s nuclear program and keep it away from a bomb, and that it has prevented another costly war in the Middle East. Just how bad will things get with Iran now that Trump has acted? Hard to say, but we can see the writing on the wall: Tehran could restart its nuclear program and edge closer to building a bomb. This would lead to increased calls from the right to—once again—stop Iran from acquiring nuclear capability, by military force if necessary. Trump is already indicating that things are heading in that direction. Just one day after breaking out of the Iran deal, Trump warned of “very severe consequences” if Iran resumes its nuclear program. To fully understand the risks of the Trump administration abandoning the Iran deal, one need only recall what happened in North Korea after Bolton, then in the Bush administration as an under secretary of state, did his part to kill another landmark nuclear deal—the Agreed Framework. In 1994, the North Korean regime threatened to go nuclear for the first time. To prove the point, Pyongyang expelled all international inspectors and made preparations to extract weapons-grade plutonium from its Yongbyon research reactor. The risks of a conventional conflict—even then— were high because the Clinton Administration was seriously considering military intervention in case diplomacy failed. An unprecedented meeting between former president Jimmy Carter and North Korean leader Kim Il-sung eventually led to the first U.S.-North Korea nuclear deal, the Agreed Framework. Though only four pages long, the Agreed Framework served a similar purpose to the 159-page Iran agreement: to prevent a state from developing nuclear weapons. And, though neither agreement was perfect, the Agreed Framework—like the Iran deal thus far—proved successful, preventing the North from producing dozens more nuclear weapons worth of fissile material. For nearly a decade, the North readmitted international inspectors, stopped producing plutonium and shelved plans to build two large reactors. Despite these significant benefits, there were those who vehemently opposed the Agreed Framework and were bent on killing it. Sound familiar? Bolton, following reports that the North was secretly pursuing a uranium enrichment program, wrote later, “This was the hammer I had been looking for to shatter the Agreed Framework.” Opposition to the Agreed Framework was indeed substantive (North Korea began a uranium path; the United States did not fulfill key obligations), but much had to do with matters unrelated to North Korea. The George W. Bush administration came into power resistant to engaging with adversaries and determined to exercise status as the world’s sole superpower, which led to the war with Iraq. Then-Vice President Dick Cheney said it all when he declared, “We don’t negotiate with evil. We defeat it.” Instead of working to improve the Agreed Framework by adding additional, stronger measures to what already existed, the Bush administration chose to back out of the agreement in 2002. Since that time, North Korea has consistently shocked the world with the speed, sophistication, and fulfillment of its nuclear ambitions. In the last year alone, Kim Jong-un demonstrated the country’s most powerful nuclear and missile tests yet—a hydrogen bomb and an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of hitting the United States. In spite of famine, international isolation, and mounting sanctions, North Korea has become one of the most challenging U.S. foreign policy issues. Now, it is difficult to conceive of North Korea relinquishing a nuclear arsenal it has worked for two decades to achieve. But in 1994, long before North Korea tested its first bomb, the North did not have nuclear weapons to give up. Since then, the chance of convincing North Korea to give up its nuclear program has become less likely and more costly. That history begs the question: What would North Korea look like today had we kept the Agreed Framework and built on it, rather than throwing it away? Unlike North Korea today, Iran does not possess a single nuclear weapon, only the theoretical capability to one day produce them. By trashing the Iran deal, President Trump risks turning Iran into North Korea. John Bolton was a central player in withdrawing U.S. support from the North Korea deal in 2002 and from the Iran deal now. History has shown that abandoning the North Korea deal made the problem worse, not better. Similarly, we can expect that the Iran crisis will now get worse, not better, as Tehran resumes its nuclear program and Trump responds with military threats.

"Behind Trump’s Termination of Iran Deal Is a Risky Bet","Advertisement Supported by News Analysis By  David E. Sanger and David D. Kirkpatrick WASHINGTON — For President Trump and two of the allies he values most — Israel and Saudi Arabia — the problem of the Iranian nuclear accord was not, primarily, about nuclear weapons. It was that the deal legitimized and normalized Iran’s clerical government, reopening it to the world economy with oil revenue that financed its adventures in Syria and Iraq, its missile program and its support of terrorist groups. Now, by announcing on Tuesday that he is exiting the nuclear deal and will reimpose economic sanctions on Iran and companies around the world that do business with the country, Mr. Trump is engaged in a grand, highly risky experiment. Mr. Trump and his Middle East allies are betting they can cut Iran’s economic lifeline and thus “break the regime,” as one senior European official described the effort. In theory, America’s withdrawal could free Iran to produce as much nuclear material as it wants — as it was doing five years ago, when the world feared that it was headed toward a bomb. But Mr. Trump’s team dismisses that risk: Iran does not have the economic strength to confront the United States, Israel and Saudi Arabia. And Iran knows that any move to produce a weapon would only provide Israel and the United States with a rationale for taking military action. It is a brutally realpolitik approach that America’s allies in Europe have warned is a historic mistake, one that could lead to confrontation, and perhaps to war. And it is a clear example of Middle East brinkmanship that runs counter to what President Barack Obama intended when the nuclear deal was struck in July 2015. Mr. Obama’s gamble in that deal — the signature foreign policy accord of his eight years in office — was straightforward. He regarded Iran as potentially a more natural ally of the United States than many of its Sunni-dominant neighbors, with a young, educated Western-oriented population that is tired of being ruled by an aging theocracy. By taking the prospect of nuclear weapons off the table, the Obama administration had argued, the United States and Iran could chip away at three decades of hostility and work on common projects, starting with the defeat of the Islamic State. It did not turn out that way. While the deal succeeded in getting 97 percent of Iran’s nuclear material out of the country, Iran’s conservatives and its military recoiled at the idea of cooperating on any projects with the West. Months before it became clear that Mr. Trump had a decent shot at being elected, the Iranian military increased support for President Bashar al-Assad in Syria; it expanded its influence in Iraq and accelerated its support for terrorist groups. And it doubled down on deploying cyberattacks against targets in the West and in Saudi Arabia, embracing a weapon that was not covered by the nuclear accord. Then came Mr. Trump, with his declaration that the deal was a “disaster” and his vow to dismantle it. That is exactly what he has now done, but at a huge cost. Moments after he delivered his statement — in which he made it sound as if Iran was cheating on the accord, even though his intelligence chiefs have testified otherwise — Mr. Trump received a stinging rebuke from Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain, President Emmanuel Macron of France and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany. The three leaders, America’s closest European allies, essentially rejected his logic. They noted that the United Nations Security Council resolution that embraced the Iran deal in 2016 “remains the binding international legal framework for the resolution of the dispute about the Iranian nuclear program.” That was polite diplomatic language for the stark conclusion that it is the United States — not Iran — that first violated the accord. And now, suddenly, the world may well be headed back to where it was in 2012: on a road to uncertain confrontation, with “very little evidence of a Plan B,” as Boris Johnson, the British foreign minister, said on a visit to Washington. Exiting the deal, with or without a plan, is fine with the Saudis. They see the accord as a dangerous distraction from the real problem of confronting Iran around the region — a problem that Saudi Arabia believes will be solved only by leadership change in Iran. The Saudis have an ally in John R. Bolton, the president’s new national security adviser, who had made clear before taking office that he shared their view. Mr. Obama’s deal, Mr. Bolton said on Tuesday afternoon, featured “an utterly inadequate treatment of the military dimension of Iran’s aspirations.” The Saudi case against Iran has been bolstered in recent months by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has repeatedly referred to Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, as “the new Hitler.” “Many countries around the world and in Europe did not realize how dangerous Hitler was until what happened, happened,” Prince Mohammed said in a recent interview with the CBS News program “60 Minutes.” “I don’t want to see the same events happening in the Middle East.” In a speech in March at the Brookings Institution, Adel al-Jubeir, the Saudi foreign minister, asserted that Iran was “the biggest problem we face in our region.” He blamed Iran for interfering in neighboring countries, backing allied armed groups in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, Yemen and elsewhere, and supplying Yemeni rebels with ballistic missiles they fired at his country. Even if its restrictions on nuclear weapons were tightened and extended, “the agreement by itself does not solve the problem of Iran,” Mr. Jubeir said. “Iran must be held accountable.” Jeremy Shapiro, research director at the European Council on Foreign Relations and a State Department official during the Obama administration, argued that the nuclear deal’s opposition from Saudi Arabia, Israel and other regional players was primarily about its effects on American politics and policy. “They believe they are in this existential conflict with the Iranian regime, and nuclear weapons are a small part of that conflict” — but the one that most influences public opinion in the United States, Mr. Shapiro said. “If the deal opened an avenue for better relations between the United States and Iran, that would be a disaster for the Saudis,” he said. “They need to ensure a motivation for American pressure against Iran that will last even after this administration.” Israel is a more complicated case. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has pressed Mr. Trump to abandon an arrangement that the Israeli leader has always detested. But Mr. Netanyahu’s own military and intelligence advisers say Israel is far safer with an Iran whose pathway to a bomb is blocked, rather than one that is once again pursuing the ultimate weapon. “The individuals who shoulder responsibility for Israel’s survival and security have been crystal clear,” Graham Allison, a Harvard professor who has spent his career examining cases of nuclear proliferation. “This will most likely lead to an outcome that is much worse not only for the U.S., but for Israel,’’ Mr. Allison said, because the current agreement rolled Iran’s nuclear program back a decade “and imposed on Iran the most intrusive inspection regime ever negotiated.” But Mr. Netanyahu holds Israel’s bullhorn, and he used it last week to persuade Mr. Trump to pull the plug on the Iran deal. By releasing Iranian documents, stolen from Tehran in January, Mr. Netanyahu proved what Western intelligence agencies long knew: A decade ago or even longer, the Iranians were working hard to design a nuclear warhead. To Mr. Netanyahu, this was proof that Iran could never be trusted and that it had reached the nuclear deal under false pretenses by pretending it never had a weapons program. To Mr. Trump and his allies, the Israeli discovery said less about Iranian nuclear capability than it did about Iranian perfidy. Given evidence that Iran was preserving its bomb designs as a hedge for the future, the discovery suggested it has not given up its ambitions. As Dennis Ross, a former Middle East negotiator, put it, someone needed to address the Israeli discovery “lest they give the Iranians the ability to pick up quickly where they left off on weaponizing.” Still, at the core of Mr. Trump’s announcement on Tuesday is a conviction that Mr. Obama made a critical mistake in agreeing to a deal that contains an expiration date. Mr. Trump’s argument is that Iran can never be allowed to accumulate enough material to assemble a bomb. So when the Europeans said that would require reopening the negotiations, Mr. Trump balked, and decided instead to scrap the entire deal. It was a classic Trumpian move, akin to the days when he would knock down New York buildings to make way for visions of grander, more glorious edifices. But in this case, it is about upsetting a global power balance and weakening a government that Mr. Trump has argued, since he began campaigning, must go.

"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Releases Green New Deal Outline","Danielle Kurtzleben  The Green New Deal legislation laid out by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey sets goals for some drastic measures to cut carbon emissions across the economy. In the process, it aims to create jobs and boost the economy. Amr Alfiky/NPR  hide caption  The Green New Deal legislation laid out by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey sets goals for some drastic measures to cut carbon emissions across the economy. In the process, it aims to create jobs and boost the economy. Whether it's a deadly cold snap or a hole under an Antarctic glacier or a terrifying new report , there seem to be constant reminders now of the dangers that climate change poses to humanity. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., think they have a start to a solution. Thursday they are introducing a framework defining what they call a "Green New Deal" — what they foresee as a massive policy package that would remake the U.S. economy and, they hope, eliminate all U.S. carbon emissions. That's a really big — potentially impossibly big — undertaking. "Even the solutions that we have considered big and bold are nowhere near the scale of the actual problem that climate change presents to us," Ocasio-Cortez told NPR's Steve Inskeep in an interview that aired Thursday on Morning Edition . She added: "It could be part of a larger solution, but no one has actually scoped out what that larger solution would entail. And so that's really what we're trying to accomplish with the Green New Deal." In very broad strokes, the Green New Deal legislation laid out by Ocasio-Cortez and Markey sets goals for some drastic measures to cut carbon emissions across the economy, from electricity generation to transportation to agriculture. In the process, it aims to create jobs and boost the economy. In that vein, the proposal stresses that it aims to meet its ambitious goals while paying special attention to groups like the poor, disabled and minority communities that might be disproportionately affected by massive economic transitions like those the Green New Deal calls for. Importantly, it's a nonbinding resolution, meaning that even if it were to pass (more on the challenges to that below), it wouldn't itself create any new programs. Instead, it would potentially affirm the sense of the House that these things should be done in the coming years. Lawmakers pass nonbinding resolutions for things as simple as congratulating Super Bowl winners , as well as to send political messages — for example, telling the president they disapprove of his trade policies , as the Senate did in summer 2018. The bill calls for a "10-year national mobilizations" toward accomplishing a series of goals that the resolution lays out. (Note: Ocasio-Cortez's office released an updated version of the bill on Thursday. The earlier version, which we had included in a prior version of this story, is still available here .) Among the most prominent, the deal calls for "meeting 100 percent of the power demand in the United States through clean, renewable, and zero-emission energy sources." The ultimate goal is to stop using fossil fuels entirely, Ocasio-Cortez's office told NPR, as well as to transition away from nuclear energy. In addition, the framework, as described in the legislation as well as a blog post — containing an updated version of "FAQs" provided to NPR by Ocasio-Cortez's office — calls for a variety of other lofty goals: Which is to say: the Green New Deal framework combines big climate-change-related ideas with a wish list of progressive economic proposals that, taken together, would touch nearly every American and overhaul the economy. Many in the climate science community, as well as Green New Deal proponents, agree that saving the world from disastrous effects of climate change requires aggressive action. And some of the Green New Deal's goals are indeed aggressive. For example, Ocasio-Cortez told NPR that "in 10 years, we're trying to go carbon-neutral." According to Jesse Jenkins, a postdoctoral environmental fellow at Harvard's Kennedy School, that may be an unreachable goal. "Where we need to be targeting really is a net-zero carbon economy by about 2050, which itself is an enormous challenge and will require reductions in carbon emissions much faster than have been achieved historically," he said. "2030 might be a little bit early to be targeting." Similarly, removing combustible engines from the roads or expanding high-speed rail to largely eliminate air travel would require nothing short of revolutionizing transportation. Likewise, some of the more progressive economic policies — universal health care and a job guarantee , for example — while popular among some Democrats, would also be very difficult to implement and transition into. On top of all that, implementing all of these policies could cost trillions upon trillions of dollars. Altogether, the Green New Deal is a loose framework. It does not lay out guidance on how to implement these policies. Rather, the idea is that Ocasio-Cortez and Markey will "begin work immediately on Green New Deal bills to put the nuts and bolts on the plan described in this resolution." And again, all of this is hypothetical — it would be tough to implement and potentially extremely expensive ... if it passed. Not at all. While the Green New Deal has in the last year or so grown central to progressive Democrats' policy conversations, the idea of a Green New Deal itself is well over a decade old. Environmentalists were talking about it as far back as 2003, when the term popped up in a  San Francisco Chronicle article about an environmentalist conference. It gained traction with a 2007 New York Times column from Thomas Friedman, where he used the phrase to describe the scope of energy investments he thought would be necessary to slow climate change on a large scale. The phrase was also used around President Barack Obama's 2009 stimulus, which had around $90 billion worth of environmental initiatives. While the idea gained some currency in Europe and also in the Green Party, it wasn't until after the 2016 election that it really gained broad popularity on the left in the U.S.  (Vox's Dave Roberts has a more thorough history here ). This latest iteration is different both in the political energy that it has amassed and the grand scope it is taking. While it was a product of the progressive activist community, Ocasio-Cortez has been perhaps the most visible proponent of the plan and has helped it gain nationwide attention. That looks unlikely. Yes, there's some energy for it on the left — some House Democrats have already said they will support the bill . However, there are indications House leadership isn't prioritizing the idea as much as those more liberal Democrats would like — Speaker Nancy Pelosi frustrated Green New Deal proponents by not giving them the kind of committee they wanted to put the policies together. After the deal's Thursday release, she also cast the plan as simply one of any number of environmental proposals the House might consider. "It will be one of several or maybe many suggestions that we receive," Pelosi told Politico . "The green dream or whatever they call it, nobody knows what it is, but they're for it right?" In addition, it's easy to see how the bill could be dangerous for moderate House Democrats, many of whom come from swing districts and may be loath to touch such a progressive proposal. Among Republicans — even those worried about climate change — the package, with its liberal economic ideas, will also likely be a nonstarter. "Someone's going to have to prove to me how that can be accomplished because it looks to me like for the foreseeable future we're gonna be using a substantial amount of fossil fuels," said Rep. Francis Rooney, R-Fla., co-chair of the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus, speaking to NPR before the Green New Deal's text was released. For his part, Rooney is in favor of a carbon tax, a policy he helped propose with a bipartisan group of lawmakers in November. Information from Ocasio-Cortez's office says that the Green New Deal could include a carbon tax, but that it would be "a tiny part" of the total package of policies. Meanwhile, there's little chance of a Green New Deal getting a vote in the Republican-controlled Senate. It's worth talking about because it already is a politically powerful idea among Democrats. Already, presidential candidates are being asked whether they support the idea of a Green New Deal, meaning it's easy to see the issue becoming a litmus test for some voters in both the 2020 congressional elections and the presidential election. To more liberal Democrats, the prospect of such an ambitious economic and environmental package at the center of the 2020 campaign may be particularly energizing. "I think it's like a really weird instinct that the Democratic Party develops to not be exciting intentionally," said Sean McElwee, co-founder of the progressive think tank Data for Progress. "Most of politics is getting people excited enough to show up and vote for you. And I think that a Green New Deal and Medicare-for-all — these are ideas that are big enough to get people excited and show up to vote for you." For her part, Ocasio-Cortez says that a policy like the Green New Deal could get voters excited enough to pressure their Congress members to support it. "I do think that when there's a wide spectrum of debate on an issue, that is where the public plays a role. That is where the public needs to call their member of Congress and say, 'This is something that I care about,' " she told NPR, adding, "Where I do have trust is in my colleagues' capacity to change and evolve and be adaptable and listen to their constituents." That said, it's easy to see how a Green New Deal litmus test could backfire on that front, endangering some Democrats — particularly in swing districts. But it's not just about national politics. The national-level energy for a Green New Deal could boost efforts in cities and states. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo , for example, has been pushing a Green New Deal in his state. Aside from the politics, there's the fact that climate change remains an impending threat — one for which the world has yet to come up with a fix. "It's a big legislation because it's a huge [expletive] problem! We're all going to die," said McElwee. "Every week it seems like the risks of climate change become more real, and the amount of devastation it is going to wreak upon humanity becomes larger, and that means we have to do bigger things."

"","During the 2016 campaign, President Donald Trump repeatedly claimed to have seen video of the U.S. handing over $400 million in cash to the Iranian government, though his campaign conceded that footage does not exist. | Evan Vucci/AP Photo By LOUIS NELSON President Donald Trump on Thursday slammed the Obama administration over a waiver it issued that would have allowed the Iranian government to briefly route money through a U.S. bank, suggesting that special counsel Robert Mueller include the revelation in his current investigation. “The Obama Administration is now accused of trying to give Iran secret access to the financial system of the United States. This is totally illegal,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “Perhaps we could get the 13 Angry Democrats to divert some of their energy to this ‘matter’ (as Comey would call it). Investigate!” Story Continued Below The waiver, discovered by congressional Republicans investigating the Iran nuclear deal, was issued in early 2016 as a means of allowing the Iranian government to access newly unfrozen funds from an Omani bank by converting them first to U.S. dollars and then to Euros. The waiver’s existence was first reported by The Associated Press. Republicans have argued that the waiver violated an Obama administration promise that Iran would not have access to U.S. financial markets, while former officials from the Obama administration have countered that the one-time waiver was within the spirit of the Iran deal and did not rise to the level of allowing the Iranians access to American financial systems.

Trump railed for months against the Iran deal and officially pulled out of the deal earlier this year over concerns about the deal’s framework and its failure to address Iran’s non-nuclear behavior, including its funding of groups that the U.S. has identified as terrorist organizations. During the 2016 campaign, the president repeatedly claimed to have seen video of $400 million in cash being handed over from the U.S. to the Iranian government, even though his campaign conceded that no such footage exists. Trump has also long complained about Mueller’s probe, referring to the investigators as a group of “13 angry Democrats” even though Mueller is a registered Republican. The Iran deal would fall well outside the purview of Mueller’s investigation, which is tasked with examining Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 election as well as allegations that the Trump campaign colluded in those efforts. The president’s dig at former FBI Director James Comey is a reference to the bureau’s 2016 investigation of Democrat Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server when she was secretary of state. Comey took the unusual step of holding a news conference to announce he would recommend that Clinton, then a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, not face charges. Comey later said that then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch instructed him to refer to the Clinton investigation as a “matter,” a directive that he later said “gave me a queasy feeling.” Missing out on the latest scoops?

"Bill Clinton Once Struck a Nuclear Deal With North Korea","President Bill Clinton took the podium on October 18, 1994, with a speech that reads like a sigh of relief—the announcement of a landmark nuclear agreement between the United States and North Korea . “This agreement is good for the United States, good for our allies, and good for the safety of the entire world,” he assured the nation. Called the Agreed Framework, it was designed to put the brakes on North Korea’s nuclear program , and it promised to put an end to years of increasing nuclear tension, including a near war, to a halt. “This agreement represents the first step on the road to a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula,” Clinton said. “It does not rely on trust.” In exchange for North Korea ending its nuclear weapons program, the United States agreed to normalize relations with the nation—and both agreed to pursue “formal assurances” not to use nukes against one another. The agreement—forged against all odds in an environment of fear and worry—seemed bulletproof. So why did it fail just a few years later? The reasons why are rooted in behind-the-scenes negotiations and international mistrust. North Korea had been preparing for nuclear war since the Cold War , when the USSR began to train North Korean scientists to build nuclear weapons. As part of the Communist bloc, North Korea was closely aligned with the USSR, and Moscow provided the technology, training and even geological surveys that helped North Korea locate local deposits of graphite and uranium ore that could be used to create nuclear weapons. According to Derek Bolton, who works with the national security think tank American Security Project, North Korea was well on its way to a nuclear weapons program by the 1960s, and had conducted successful experiments with fission, the underlying chemical phenomenon that can cause a nuclear reaction, under the supervision of the USSR as early as 1963. Over the years, North Korea tried to find more support for its nuclear program, includingengaging South Korea in talks about whether the two countries should develop a joint nuclear weapon in secret. (South Korea declined.) But it took until the 1980s for the world to realize that North Korea might be serious about building nukes—and to recognize that it might be closer to nuclear weapons than previously thought. A1992 file photo showing missiles marching in the North Korean People’s forces’ 60th anniversary parade. (Credit: Jiji Press/KNS/AFP/Getty Images) Despite its apparent commitment to developing nuclear weapons, North Korean leader Kim Il Sung did ratify the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in 1985. The international treaty, which was designed to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, had been in force since 1970, but North Korea had lagged behind other nations like the United States. Now that North Korea was on board, though, it also began mining uranium and producing plutonium—both critical to the production of nuclear weapons—and creating nuclear reactors during the 1980s. Then, in 1989, the Soviet Union fell, leaving North Korea increasingly isolated. “With the collapse of the Soviet Union, North Korea lost its main protector,” Georgetown University professor Keir Leiber told Vox ’s Zack Beauchamp. “What does it have that can counter conventional US power? The answer is obvious: nuclear weapons.” That same year, the U.S. discovered Kim Il Sung’s covert nuclear program using satellite imagery, and North Korea kept developing weapons even afteragreeing with South Korea not to test or manufacture nukes. As a result, the International Atomic Energy Agency, an autonomous nuclear oversight organization that reports directly to the United Nations , asked to conduct inspections of North Korean nuclear sites in 1992 and 1993. North Korea refused, and threatened to back out of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. This represented a double crisis for then-President Clinton. Republicans in Congress pressured him not to negotiate with North Korea, but the international community and Democrats argued that engagement was the only solution. Meanwhile, North Korea escalated its rhetoric, telling the United States that North Korea would turn Seoul into “a sea of flames” if the U.S. pursued sanctions through the United Nations.

(Credit: Korean Central News Agency/AP Photo) The U.S. considered military intervention, but also sent Jimmy Carter to Pyongyang to meet with Kim Il Sung. Carter convinced Kim to start nuclear talks—but the day negotiations were supposed to begin, Kim died. He was succeeded by his son, Kim Jong Il , the very man who founded the most controversial nuclear complex in North Korea, a facility in Yongbyon. Things looked grim, but Clinton became increasingly convinced that direct negotiations were the only way. However, American negotiators doubted from the start that diplomacy would work. “The initial contacts were to test the proposition that we could address their security concerns by getting them to give up their nuclear weapons,” Robert Gallucci, the chief negotiator, told Beyond Parallel in a 2016 interview. “It was not so much of a conviction on anybody’s part…It was possibly true, and worth testing.” For 16 months, Gallucci and his team conducted intense negotiations with North Korea. The countries locked horns on what it would take for North Korea to stop producing nukes. Finally, they came to an agreement—the Agreed Framework. Just four pages long, the agreement said that North Korea would shut down its main nuclear reactor in Yongbyon, abandon two others, and seal fuel that could potentially be used to create a nuclear weapon. In exchange, the U.S. would provide oil to make up for the fuel lost from the dismantled plants and would build two new “light fuel” plants from which it would be harder to extract nuclear materials. If North Korea did try to get fuel out of the new plants, it would be easy for nuclear watchdogs to identify—and hard to hide. In addition, the agreement promised that the U.S. would lift economic sanctions and its diplomatic freeze on North Korea and agree that it would not use nuclear weapons of its own on North Korea.

(Credit: Marcy Nighswander/Getty Images) On the surface, it looked like the U.S. was offering huge concessions to North Korea in exchange for few assurances. But behind the scenes, the Clinton administration thought that North Korea was on the verge of collapse and likely wouldn’t last long enough for the U.S. to build the agreed-upon reactors. In North Korea, the agreement wasn’t taken seriously. Isolated, impoverished and headed by a leader who believed nuclear power would give the country power on the international stage, North Korea had little motivation to give up its program. Clinton knew the agreement would be hugely controversial—so he structured it in a way that ensured it wouldn’t have to be ratified by the Senate. Republicans were infuriated. And shortly after the agreement was signed, the Republicans won control of Congress. They grilled Gallucci. “It was pretty harsh,” he told PBS in 2003. “We did not get ticker tape parades, as it turned out.” Congress made it clear that they would not agree to actually fund the implementation of the project or sanction formal peace agreements between the two countries. Meanwhile, North Korea continued producing uranium. Kim Jong Il, it turned out, had used potential nukes as a bargaining chip—even though he had no intention of stopping the program. Despite promising initial results, North Korea began flouting the agreement more and more. North Korea ignored warnings that the agreement was in jeopardy and soon intelligence agencies realized it possessed much more advanced nuclear tech than the U.S. had suspected. At first it seemed like George W. Bush , who took office in 2001, might continue Clinton-era diplomatic policies toward North Korea. But then things fell apart. Bush’s diplomats stopped sending fuel shipments; North Korea complained bitterly that the promised nuclear reactors had never been built. And when the September 11 terrorist attacks happened, it pushed American diplomacy in other directions—and Bush mentioned North Korea as one of the three countries in his “Axis of Evil” State of the Union Speech in 2002. Soon, relations between the two countries were openly tense, if not hostile. North Korea dropped out of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 2003. By 2006, it had conducted its first nuclear test—an underground delivery that may have been a fizzle, or unsuccessful explosion. And though Bill Clinton himself headed to North Korea to successfully negotiate the release of two American hostages in 2009, it was too late to halt North Korea’s march toward nukes. Though the United States continues to try to seek solutions to North Korea’s potential nukes, including the potential of talks between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un, Clinton’s vision of an end to nuclear proliferation on the Korean Peninsula now seems more like a mirage.

"Leaving the Iran Nuclear Deal Will Have Unintended Consequences","Shadow Government:  Leaving the Iran Nuclear Deal Will Have Unintended Consequences  Leaving the Iran Nuclear Deal Wil...  President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw the United States from the Iran nuclear deal and reinstate all U.S. sanctions won’t deliver punishing economic pressure capable of forcing Iran to submit to Washington’s policy demands. Along with diplomatic furor and a blow to nuclear arms control, the move also comes with damning unintended economic consequences for the United States. The new U.S. policy involves snapping back all the sanctions on Iran that were removed in 2016 under the deal. Primary among them are the sanctions on Iran’s central bank and on its oil trade, the engine of the country’s economy. Administration officials are betting that foreign firms that have invested in Iran and buy its oil will abide by the sanctions. They will also fan out around the globe to try to pressure foreign countries into joining the United States with measures of their own. Presumably the White House thinking is that the Iranian regime, once backed up against the wall, will capitulate or crumble. This scenario is unlikely. Not every foreign company, bank, or oil trader will be inclined to comply with U.S. sanctions, particularly if their own governments are frustrated with the U.S. re-imposition of sanctions. There is no multilateral interest now in targeting Iran with financial pressure and diplomatic isolation, unlike during the 2012 to 2015 period of most intensive global sanctions on Iran. Even when foreign firms are inclined to comply, many will be confused about how to do so. Explaining the rules to foreign banking associations, chambers of commerce, foreign financial and commercial regulators, and central banks takes an army of U.S. diplomats. The Trump administration has hollowed out the State Department’s ranks, and the department did away with its sanctions implementation office last year. Several key senior staff members at the Treasury Department, which is responsible for crafting and enforcing the sanctions, just resigned. To be sure, some purchasers of Iranian oil will wind down their business to escape legal liability and out of grudging loyalty to the United States, a security ally. European refiners, which buy more than 500,000 barrels per day, will probably unhappily follow the U.S. sanctions rules. Japanese and South Korean purchasers, which together account for more than 500,000 barrels per day, will too. Even here, though, the effects may be delayed or softened as countries seek temporary waivers or exemptions. But Iran’s biggest oil purchasers, China and India, may be less inclined to cooperate. They might even find opportunities to purchase additional barrels of oil from Iran, which has been pushing out more supplies in recent months. This could meaningfully diminish the effect of the sanctions. When it comes to foreign banks and traders severing financial relationships and trade in goods with Iran, compliance will also be a mixed bag. European and Asian firms of any meaningful size will not tolerate the risk of violating sanctions and will stop dealing with sanctioned entities. These institutions, however, were already risk-averse and had minimized their exposure to Iran, so the effect of the new sanctions will be marginal at best. Meanwhile, some foreign banks insulated from U.S. jurisdiction could create bespoke facilities to sustain trade with Iran, even if they are hit with sanctions. There is precedent for this in China. More generally, these broad new Iran sanctions will encourage some countries to explore an array of alternative financial conduits to Iran, from barter to blockchain, to shield their banks and companies from U.S. jurisdiction. Russia and China are already pioneering alternative payment systems to stay outside of U.S. banks and currency, and these measures will likely accelerate that work and international interest. European leaders are threatening to push back re-imposition of U.S. sanctions, guaranteeing a path for their companies to sustain business with Iran. They are exploring a revival of blocking statutes that ban European companies from complying with U.S. sanctions, measures that during the Bill Clinton presidency helped undermine the effect of U.S. Iran sanctions. However, these European Union leaders ultimately cannot tell private companies how to operate and force them to tempt the U.S. Treasury’s sanctions enforcement team. Chinese and Indian political officials are no doubt also considering how to continue some oil business with Iran in defiance of the United States. And Iranian and independent oil smugglers are dusting off their old playbooks for moving Iranian crude. During the prior period of intensive global sanctions on the country, smugglers mislabeled Iranian crude cargoes, blended Iranian crude with other regional grades, and engaged in ship-to-ship transfers to disguise its origin. Unfortunately, smugglers were very good at this activity then and show evidence of sophisticated evolution over time. They learned from the Iran sanctions of the 1990s that U.S. pressure can practically shut down foreign oil and gas exploration and production in Iran, but it has limitations that can be exploited when it comes to rules against trading petroleum, condensate, refined product, and petrochemicals. This energy trading will probably be enough to enable Iran’s resistance economy to soldier on, though not to achieve marked growth. Iran is no Venezuela, which will no doubt see more of its barrels disappear from the market this year than Iran will, as President Nicolás Maduro drives Venezuela toward total economic collapse. Now, there will be far more opportunities to cheat if the rest of the world does not cooperate with the U.S. sanctions. That lack of cooperation will make it harder to enforce the sanctions. Foreign partners may not collect or share intelligence on evasion with U.S. government analysts as they did in the past under a multilateral sanctions framework. They also may stand in the way of efforts to enforce sanctions by impeding U.S. official access to violators to try to convince them to desist. This slow-rolling tactic to stymie U.S. sanctions enforcement would actually be a smaller problem for the United States than the lack of foreign cooperation to match U.S. sanctions in the EU and other jurisdictions. Prior sanctions on Iran were as forceful as they were because they were multilateral and involved the strong will of foreign counterparts to join the effort. Some of the most powerful oil import restrictions and the cutoff of Iran from SWIFT, the global financial payments messaging system, came from the EU, not the United States. Now, U.S. allies have sanctions fatigue (to say nothing of their tariff woes) and are fed up with the United States bullying them and their companies. As an example, sanctions on Russia that the United States rolled out last month roiled financial markets, spiked the price of aluminum, and squeezed supply chains around the world. In the face of distress and outrage from businesspeople from Munich to Seoul to Hong Kong, the U.S. Treasury had to back off. Firms in the same countries, many of whom are allies, would also be hemmed in with the Iran measures. This picture does not bode well for the strength of U.S. sanctions. Beyond this challenge, the sanctions involve serious unintended consequences that will make life more expensive and less safe for U.S. citizens. To begin with, the announcement of sanctions drove up oil prices and may continue to apply upward pressure as the conditions for the new oil penalties become clearer over the next 180 days. Higher oil prices translate into higher gasoline prices for U.S. consumers right as the country enters the summer driving season, which already puts pressure on fuel stocks and prices. Another unintended consequence of the sanctions is that they give Russia and Saudi Arabia more clout as alternative oil suppliers to fill the gap left by Iran as customers wind down their contracts. This arrangement directly empowers and enriches Russia, giving it a greater ability to support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s bloody campaign against his citizens, and to undermine U.S. democratic institutions with misinformation and malicious cyber activities. By enriching Moscow and its oil companies, the new Iran sanctions also undermine U.S. sanctions on Russia, a stark example of U.S. policy working at cross purposes. Both Russia and Saudi Arabia have an interest in exercising their influence to keep oil prices fairly high to break even on their enormous burdens of state spending. Also, ahead of the pending public offering of the Saudi state oil company Aramco, high oil prices are an excellent way to pump up company value. As a further unintended consequence, the new Iran sanctions introduce a major source of tension into the U.S.-China relationship. China is the largest consumer of Iranian crude and probably the only one with the scale of economy and political will necessary to sustain trading of Iranian oil even if an offending Chinese importer or bank is slapped with sanctions penalties. China’s potential to not comply with sanctions is a new lever over the United States that it could pull if Beijing decides to engage in a power struggle with Washington. The most strategically significant unintended economic consequence of the new sanctions, however, is that these measures may ultimately weaken the strength of sanctions as a tool of U.S. statecraft. Limited or uneven compliance with the sanctions will contribute to the impression that sanctions do not work, which will make countries less likely to heed them in the future. In turn, this will make this tool of U.S. foreign policy less cogent and less useful to U.S. leaders not just to counter Iran, but against all security threats. This would be devastating to the Trump administration, which has made maximum-pressure financial sanctions a cornerstone of an array of foreign-policy files, from Iran to North Korea to Venezuela and even now to Russia, in a reversal from its early interest in rolling back Russia sanctions. It will also be damaging to future presidents, shrinking the tools available to project U.S. strength and leadership internationally. Ultimately, this unintended legacy of the present reversal in Iran policy may be among the gravest and most debilitating for U.S. national security.

"Europe should strike a tough pose with Trump on the Iran nuclear deal","Ellie Geranmayeh  @EllieGeranmayeh  22nd March, 2018  Europeans should toughen their position in ongoing talks with the Trump administration if they are to preserve the Iran nuclear deal and limit insecurity in the Middle East. France, the United Kingdom, and Germany (the ‘E3’) appear set to intensify ongoing talks with the US in an effort to convince Donald Trump to stick to the Iran nuclear deal. Trump has threatened to withdraw from the agreement in May unless certain preconditions were met. Europeans hope the ongoing discussions will be able to find a middle way to both safeguard the nuclear deal and address outstanding areas of concern with Iran, such as on missiles and regional issues. However, Trump’s recent nomination of Mike Pompeo as US secretary of state increases the risk that this approach will backfire on Europe. European policymakers largely viewed Rex Tillerson as a voice of moderation within the White House and as someone who, together with secretary of defence James Mattis, influenced Trump towards a more pragmatic position on Iran. If Europe is serious about saving the nuclear deal, then the appointment of Pompeo, an Iran-hawk in Washington , should serve as an urgent prompt to rethink its current strategy. Some in European policy circles hoped that Trump’s statement on the nuclear deal on 12 January this year was part of his maximalist negotiating tactics, and that if Europe showed some flexibility, the president would be climb down from these demands. But one of the reasons Trump cited when firing Tillerson was their disagreement over the Iran nuclear deal. This should indicate that the moderate voices in the White House have been unable to bridge gaps between Trump and Europe over the nuclear deal. Trump, meanwhile, remarked on the “ very similar thought process ” he and Pompeo share on a number of issues. Pompeo has been especially outspoken on Iran: he opposed the nuclear deal, supported regime change, and downplayed the costs of war with Iran. With Pompeo now in charge of US diplomacy, Europeans are likely to face a tougher and non-accommodating negotiating posture from the Trump administration over the nuclear deal. This comes against a backdrop of rising regional tensions between Iran and Israel , in addition to repeated pledges from Trump to confront Iran, most recently in his Nowruz message marking the Iranian new year. Trump’s deal-making during his term in office should create doubt as to whether he would actually implement a side framework agreement of the type that his administration is currently seeking to strike with Europe over Iran policy. On foreign policy matters, Trump has remained dangerously unpredictable, and threatened everything from trade war to nuclear war. The pattern of negotiations between his administration and the US Congress over immigration and healthcare suggests that, even if Trump’s counterparts make concessions to fulfil his demands, there is no guarantee that he will, in the end, accept it. At least in private, Europe should be devising a Plan B and stress its willingness to pursue alternative options to preserve the nuclear agreement if Trump withdraws in the coming weeks Europeans should therefore be clear-eyed about the chances of success of current talks with the United States. Based on recent precedent, Trump is likely to perceive Europe’s flexibility and accommodation over Iran policy as a weakness that he can exploit to raise the benchmarks of demands. Moreover, by threatening imminent withdrawal from the nuclear deal, Trump is increasingly pressuring the E3 to jump on board with his efforts to undermine the agreement. Republican lawmakers such as Senator Bob Corker have also adopted this stance and warned that, unless the E3 sign up to the side framework agreement that meets US demands, Trump is unlikely to extend sanctions waivers due in May. Yet, in their attempt to save the nuclear agreement through reaching a broader understanding with the Trump administration on Iran policy, the E3 must ensure that Europe does not become complicit in hollowing out the nuclear agreement. So far, the International Atomic Energy Agency has repeatedly verified that Iran is fulfilling its nuclear-related obligations. However, Iran has firmly indicated it will take reciprocal action to match any US backtracking from the deal. A potential side agreement between the E3 and the US with respect to the nuclear deal therefore risks a tit-for-tat exchange between Tehran and Washington that could alter and muddy their respective commitments under the agreement and cumulatively cause it to unravel. In light of Pompeo’s appointment, the E3 should harden their negotiating tactics on the nuclear deal in ways that match the mindset of the Trump administration. First, Europeans should take a unified and more assertive position in forthcoming talks with the US to underscore that they will not be party to, nor accept as permissible, violations of a multilateral and United Nations Security Council-enshrined agreement. The E3 should continue to outline that it will not, and indeed cannot, alter expiration dates of the terms in the nuclear deal (so-called “sunset provisions”) as Trump has demanded. If Trump wants to kill the deal, he must take full responsibility, and Europe should avoid guilt by association. Second, Europe should continue to show openness to working with the US administration on a follow-up to the nuclear agreement with Iran once the current deal has reached a more mature stage of implementation. The E3 should also have a candid exchange with Iran on regional security and demonstrate to the Trump administration that a range of tools exists to address concerns related to Iran. But in return for this flexibility, Europeans should outline an expectation that Washington will adhere to its existing obligations under the multilateral agreement and minimise the unpredictability surrounding Trump’s waivers of sanctions. A firm European position in defence of the diplomatic accord may reduce the growing risk of confrontation between Washington and Tehran in the Middle East, for which Europe will inevitably bear the cost The sequencing of European measures and flexibility will be important to strengthening the E3’s position. For example, the European Union should first receive firm assurances that Trump will waive nuclear-related sanctions in May before it even debates the tougher measures against Iran’s missiles programme proposed by the US and reportedly supported by the E3 during a meeting with EU foreign ministers on Monday this week. The E3 should also consider how political and legislative measures within the US could better guarantee US commitments to the nuclear deal. This could entail extensions in the length of time between each waiver of US secondary sanctions related to Iran’s nuclear programme (thereby easing the unpredictability surrounding Trump’s actions), and pressing for progress in the Airbus aviation deals with Iran explicitly permitted under the nuclear deal. Third, Europeans should prepare for the worst-case scenario – namely, a US withdrawal from the agreement and snap-back sanctions in May – and minimise the damage that will ensue. Pompeo’s appointment should be a trigger for European policymakers and companies to step up contingency planning to salvage the deal even without the US. For Iran to continue implementing the restrictions on its nuclear programme, there must be a degree of political and economic incentives. As outlined elsewhere , Europe could provide this package to Iran by using a range of political and technical tools that ring-fence companies from the enforcement of US secondary sanctions through legal carve-outs, sector-specific exemptions, political understandings, and reviving the EU Blocking Regulation. In current talks with the US, Europe should privately stress its willingness to pursue alternative options to preserve the nuclear agreement. A significant benefit of outlining a contingency plan at this stage is the deterrence impact it may have on Trump’s decision to kill the deal through highlighting the isolation the US would face. In short, Europe should outline, as it has done on the issue of trade and the Paris climate accord, that it will work with like-minded coalitions to fill the gaps left by US withdrawal. This strategy may not, in the end, alter the decision by Trump to execute his campaign promise to “dismantle” the “disastrous deal” with Iran. But this approach at least provides Europe with the political capital to try to salvage the agreement and thereby secure its own non-proliferation goals. If Iran’s nuclear programme expands in respond to Trump’s withdrawal, other regional powers, such as Saudi Arabia, have warned that they will do the same. A firm European position in defence of the diplomatic accord may also reduce the growing risk of confrontation between Washington and Tehran in the Middle East, for which Europe will inevitably bear the cost. This approach also sets a precedent that Europe is a credible international partner, demonstrating political willingness to safeguard international norms at a time when global leadership is lacking.

"Trump scraps the Iran nuclear deal. Now what?","President Donald Trump's decision to reimpose sanctions on Iran — violating the Obama-era nuclear deal — leaves the other nations involved scrambling to salvage the pact. Experts warned it also risks weakening trust in the United States, raising questions about whether Washington can be taken at its word, and could potentially bolster hard-liners in Tehran who are pushing an agenda of Middle East aggression. Trump has called it the “worst deal ever negotiated” and wanted Britain, France and Germany — co-signatories, along with Russia, China and the European Union — to toughen up its terms. In announcing his decision Tuesday, Trump blasted the deal as "defective at its core," later adding that "America will not be held hostage to nuclear blackmail." His primary complaint is that the 2015 pact, which was originally conceived as a starting point for better relations between Iran and the West, doesn’t extend beyond 2025. He also criticized the deal for failing to address other concerns about Iran, such as its ballistic missile program or its support of the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, its military aid of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and its role in the war in Yemen. Trump’s stance echoes Israel’s longstanding opposition to the deal. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week alleged that “Iran lied” about its nuclear weapon ambitions in the 2000s , although the information he shared seemed to match up with what nuclear inspectors had already reported about Tehran’s program. Although Trump has been emphatic in his opposition to the deal, he was less clear about what should replace it or how far the U.S. is willing to go to limit Iran’s nuclear ambitions or its regional aggression. “With this decision, we at least get some clarity on the White House position,” said Sanam Vakil, a professor in the Middle East studies department at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Bologna, Italy. It also moves the Iran-U.S. tensions into a new phase after months of threats and insults. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, who is considered a moderate, last month dismissed Trump as a "building constructor" with no understanding of law or international treaties. Under the deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) , the United States committed to ease a series of sanctions on Iran and has done so under a string of “waivers” that effectively suspend them. Failure to renew waivers means the sanctions will be restored, but under U.S. law the White House must allow a 90-day or 180-day period to allow companies to withdraw from any contracts or financial transactions involving Iran. The waiver that was due for renewal Saturday covered Iran's central bank and was intended at limiting Iran's oil exports. Other waivers are due for renewal in July. In his televised address on Tuesday, Trump said the United States would impose the "highest-level" economic sanctions on the Iranian regime, suggesting that he intends to scrap all of the waivers. Restoring sanctions amounts to a U.S. breach of the original deal whereas Iran was deemed to be compliant, according to international nuclear inspectors. The JCPOA has a dispute resolution clause that would allow Iran to raise a complaint against the U.S. for violating its terms; that could buy time for more negotiation, but Trump’s solid opposition to the deal means the dispute mechanism is unlikely to prove fruitful. While denouncing Trump’s plan, Tehran has not been entirely clear about what it will do once the impromptu public protests subside and American flags stop being burned. It could resume its nuclear arms program or step up its military involvement in Iraq, Syria, Yemen and Lebanon. The secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, Ali Shamkhani, warned last month that Iran was considering withdrawing from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Iran says it has the technical ability to enrich uranium to a higher level than it could before the deal. Rouhani has also ruled out any attempt to restrict its missiles , saying, "We will not negotiate with anyone about our weapons and defenses, and we will make and store as many weapons, facilities and missiles as we need.” If the deal is considered dead, Iran would no longer be obliged to allow international nuclear inspectors “so that we lose what visibility we have there,” Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, predicted on "Fox News Sunday ." However, Iran appears to be in line with European powers who want the deal to continue regardless of U.S. involvement. Rouhani said after Trump's announcement that he was sending his foreign minister to meet the remaining powers in the deal but warned there was only a short time to negotiate with them. The European Union's foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, said the deal is “a good and robust agreement that serves the interests of all parties.” And French Defense Minister Florence Parly said Tuesday that "we will need to keep pushing to defend the improvement of this deal, whether the United States is part of it or not." However, a major hurdle for the remaining powers in the deal will be operating under a different sanctions policy than the U.S.; experts predict that most major international companies will comply with U.S. sanctions in order to protect their interests in the U.S. market. Major companies in the U.S. and Europe could be hurt, too. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that licenses held by Boeing and its European competitor Airbus to sell billions of dollars in commercial jetliners to Iran will be revoked. Certain exemptions are to be negotiated, but Mnuchin refused to discuss what products might qualify. At a briefing for reporters late Tuesday, a State Department official confirmed that the White House was considering sanctions on non-U.S.companies that did not comply. And while Iran’s leaders may have been more willing to take a softer stance in talks with non-U.S. parties, anger at Trump’s decision may make that politically impossible. “Should there be some momentum, Iran has indicated that perhaps it might negotiate on some of the wider issues,” Vakil said. “But right now it is obviously in a defensive mood, and domestic, sectional politics very much drives its ability to come back to the negotiating table.” The perceived benefit of restoring sanctions is that an economically weakened and isolated Iran would have to scale back its regional aggression. “It also puts pressure on Iran and the international community to address Trump’s personal concerns with the deal,” Vakil said. However, a simulation exercise carried out last fall by Israeli and American experts concluded that there was little else to be gained by scuttling the deal. In particular, it seems unlikely Iran would agree to a tougher deal while the international position is so divided; splintering the deal plays into Tehran’s hands, the experts concluded. The collapse of the deal comes amid signs that Israel and Iran are moving closer to open warfare . Netanyahu on Tuesday accused Iran of deploying "very dangerous weapons" in neighboring Syria. "It is now seeking to plant very dangerous weapons in Syria ... for the specific purpose of our destruction,” he told reporters. Israel has repeatedly warned it will not tolerate a lasting Iranian military presence in Syria , and is believed to have been behind recent airstrikes on Syrian military bases that killed Iranian soldiers, prompting Tehran to vow revenge. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied involvement. Before Trump announced his decision, French President Emmanuel Macron had warned that war could ensue if Trump withdrew from the deal. Without limits on Iran’s nuclear ambitions or inspections of Iranian facilities, Israel could feel compelled to act against its archenemy. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said last week that scrapping the Iran deal put the entire Middle East in a “very dangerous position." After Trump's announcement on Tuesday, Macron tweeted that France, Germany, and the U.K. regretted the United States' decision but would work "collectively on a broader framework, covering nuclear activity, the post-2025 period, ballistic activity and stability in the Middle-East, notably Syria, Yemen and Iraq." Perhaps the most troubling outcome of Trump’s move for diplomats is the longer-term erosion of trust in the United States. Iranian Vice President Eshaq Jahangiri said Tuesday that only “naïve” individuals would negotiate with the U.S. in the future. His comments echoed a warning from Rouhani that “no one will trust America again" after this episode. It is something that might be noted by North Korea’s Kim Jong Un as he prepares to sit down for talks with the U.S. following last month’s summit that eased tensions with South Korea. The deal also has opponents in Iran, where many say they haven’t seen the economic benefits that Rouhani promised would flow following the lifting of sanctions. Spiraling inflation in Iran has fueled nationwide protests in December and January. The collapse of the deal would also vindicate the position of Rouhani’s hard-line opponents who criticized the very existence of any deal with the U.S. That could drive Iran back into the hands of hard-liners in elections for its Parliament in 2020 and its presidency in 2021. “The fallout from Trump’s announcement will leave Rouhani completely marginalized,” Vakil said. “Conservatives will have the dominant narrative, and Rouhani’s legacy of engagement with the international community will be completely discredited.” © 2019 NBC UNIVERSAL","https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/trump-scraps-iran-nuclear-deal-now-what-n872296"
"Trump Accidentally Just Triggered Global Nuclear Proliferation","Argument:  Trump Accidentally Just Triggered Global Nuclear Proliferation  Trump Accidentally Just Triggered Global N...  On Feb. 1, the Trump administration made good on its threats and began the official withdrawal process from the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty between the United States and Russia. As others have pointed out , this was a short-sighted decision. By withdrawing from the INF Treaty, the Trump administration has eliminated any consequences of Moscow’s alleged noncompliance, leaving it free to deploy as many intermediate-range missiles as it wants. U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to throw out the rulebook instead of trying to enforce it greases the wheels for a return to U.S.-Russian nuclear arms racing—with potentially dire consequences for international security. But there is another outcome of the end of INF Treaty that is less examined and no less dangerous: It will undermine global efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons to countries that don’t yet have them. As an instrument of arms control, the INF Treaty has done much more than limit the capabilities of the individual parties involved. For over 30 years, it has quietly been a central part of the international nonproliferation regime, too. This collection of treaties, informal agreements, and institutions that keep the spread of nuclear weapons in check is often cast in architectural terms: an edifice held up by pillars built on a weathered but enduring foundation. In reality, the nonproliferation regime is a complex and deeply intertwined network that more resembles a spiderweb: stronger than the sum of its parts but likely to unravel if individual threads start to break. Perhaps the most important thread in this tapestry is the long-running tradition of close cooperation between Washington and Moscow on nuclear issues. The INF Treaty itself is a product of their joint efforts, as are the 1968 Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons (commonly known as the NPT), the Nuclear Suppliers Group, and International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards, among others. U.S.-Soviet partnership on nonproliferation remained sacrosanct even during the worst moments of the Cold War, in part thanks to regular interaction between Russian and American officials across a host of treaties and other frameworks. As the historical record shows, just talking to one another, almost regardless of outcome, built up trust and personal rapport that kept cooperation going when times got tough. From this vantage, the INF Treaty’s demise is not just symptomatic of the deep crisis between the two nuclear powers—it is also a contributor to it. Its collapse means the elimination of an official channel for Russian and American interaction at a moment when there are precious few other options. The Special Verification Commission, the pact’s dispute resolution mechanism, convened 30 meetings through the early 2000s but was sorely underutilized in recent years. It would have been the natural setting to address noncompliance allegations—and could have helped to get relations back on track—but this opportunity came off the table when the treaty was scrapped. The importance of U.S.-Russian relations to nonproliferation means that the end of the INF Treaty will affect other areas of the regime, too. As many experts have observed , New START—now the last bastion of bilateral arms control—is probably the most susceptible to contagion. Set to expire in just two years, this 2010 agreement can be extended for up to five years if both parties agree. Emboldened by its withdrawal from the INF Treaty, however, the Trump administration might pass over this silver bullet for the freedom to pursue maximum flexibility in its military options. If this happens, the nuclear arms race that follows might well cause states that have foregone their own deterrent—such as Iran, Saudi Arabia , or even Germany —to reconsider their decisions. Avoiding this outcome was part of the rationale for negotiating both  treaties in the first place. A development like this would be especially dangerous at a time when there is no legally binding instrument that prohibits nuclear testing. The U.S. withdrawal from the INF Treaty or, more precisely, the reasons it did so are relevant here, too. The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT)—which should fill this void—is unenforceable in part because the United States has yet to ratify it. CTBT opponents in Washington often argue that ratification is not in the U.S. interest, however, citing long-debunked stories of Russian covert testing that refuse to die. While the Obama and Trump administrations agree that Russia violated the INF Treaty, scrapping that agreement rather than using the Special Verification Commission to address these allegations (or Russian concerns about U.S. compliance) lends credence to the myth that Moscow is a perennial cheater with whom verification doesn’t work. This story is one that will be hard to un-tell even if a new U.S. administration seeking CTBT ratification is elected in 2020. Both of these outcomes weaken the nonproliferation regime in and of themselves, but they also stand to do real damage to the credibility of the NPT. The cornerstone of the nonproliferation regime, the NPT lays out a bargain between the treaty’s designated nuclear weapon states, which agree to cease the arms race and pursue disarmament, and states that do not already possess nuclear weapons, which pledge not to acquire them. The validity of this bargain has been under scrutiny for decades, particularly by those who feel that the pace of disarmament has been unacceptably slow. This perception will be reinforced by the unraveling of the INF Treaty, which constitutes not just a plateau in arms control but, in the eyes of many, a step backward. Similarly, over the 50 years since the NPT was negotiated, its parties have agreed by consensus on clarifications to the obligations of the designated nuclear weapons states. In 1995, for instance, its parties identified “the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally” as a condition for the treaty’s indefinite extension. The INF Treaty’s demise and its related implications for other arms control measures are tangible evidence that these commitments not being fulfilled either—a reality that is unlikely to go unnoticed when the NPT is reviewed in 2019 and 2020. The scrapping of the INF Treaty could lead some observers to conclude that commitments made under the NPT can be ignored, particularly when the political situation isn’t conducive to upholding them. This conclusion is dangerous, and it’s one that will make for a weaker nonproliferation regime at a time when it can ill afford to be anything but robust. As the West grapples with North Korea’s nuclear weapons program, the slow unraveling of the Iran nuclear deal, the need to keep pace with potentially destabilizing new technologies, and the weaponization of nontraditional domains such as space and cyberspace, success will require using the full complement of nonproliferation instruments. This necessarily entails both U.S.-Russia engagement and robust arms control, and with the INF Treaty effectively dead, it comes up short on both scores. The sad irony is that filling the gap the treaty leaves behind will take much more political will than preserving it would have, with few obvious gains. Much of the concern over the end of the INF Treaty has understandably centered on its implications for missile proliferation, the U.S. relationship with NATO, and whether a replacement agreement that includes China can possibly be negotiated. While these are all valid, however, it’s also worth appreciating just how widespread the impact of the end of the treaty is likely to be—particularly with respect to nonproliferation. The international community, experts, and policymakers should start bracing for the ripple effect of its demise. It has the potential to be much more significant—and more pervasive—than they may appreciate.

"Iran: The case for protecting humanitarian trade","Ellie Geranmayeh & James Miller    13th September, 2018  New US sanctions will put the health of ordinary Iranians at risk. Europe can take concrete steps to minimise this – steps which also support its ongoing commitment to the nuclear deal A crisis is looming in Iran’s healthcare sector: patients are reporting shortages in life-saving medicine. The situation is expected to worsen once US sanctions on Iran are reimposed in November. European and US companies that can provide the advanced medicine and equipment needed to treat chronic diseases inside Iran are grappling with how to sustain their operations. The goods that are making it into Iran are being sold at soaring prices due to a sharp currency downturn following Donald Trump’s sanctions decision. Millions of ordinary Iranians are bracing themselves for the impact of these sanctions. The UN special rapporteur for human rights warned that the sanctions will undermine human rights in the country, drive people into poverty, and make imported goods unaffordable. The impact of incoming sanctions on the humanitarian sector contradicts the US administration’s repeated statements in support of the Iranian people. In this series of commentaries, ECFR assesses the likely impact of US sanctions on economic ties between Europe and Iran, covering strategically important areas such as trade in essential goods, energy, and banking. The series examines how European governments can minimise the fallout of their attempts to maintain Iranian compliance with the nuclear deal. Part 1: Trump’s Iran sanctions: an explainer on their impact for Europe Part 2: Iran: The case for protecting humanitarian trade Part 3: Can Iran weather the oil-sanctions storm? Part 4: Bankless task: can Europe stay connected to Iran? Part 5: Iran oil exports: 8 waivers and the upcoming OPEC meeting Part 6: Trading with Iran via the special purpose vehicle: How it can work Iranians experienced similar hardship between 2012-2013 when the United States and Europe introduced the severest of sanctions to pressure Iran to restrict its nuclear programme. At the time, the US Treasury provided broad authorisation and exceptions for the sale of medicine and medical devices. Yet only a limited number of Western companies managed to operate under these conditions. Many were forced to halt or downsize trade due to disruptions in banking and high operational costs. A repeat of this situation must be prevented. Unilateral US sanctions must not be allowed to needlessly cause suffering to millions of Iranian citizens. This is especially the case given that Iran continues to implement restrictions on its nuclear programme under the 2015 deal. Europe, China, and Russia have also vowed to uphold the agreement. The overarching hurdle facing many companies that export medical goods and services to Iran is related to securing banking services and finance to enable such transactions to happen. This includes a recent foreign currency shortage with which to reimburse European companies. The lack of clarity over how the US will enforce its sanctions has exacerbated these problems. For example, while the latest US OFAC guidelines reaffirm that there is broad authorisation for humanitarian transactions, there is ambiguity over how extensively the US will use secondary sanctions to target private Iranian banks. Since the nuclear deal, such banks were clearly exempt from secondary sanctions. That meant that non-US companies could establish ties with such banks to facilitate payments for the sale of humanitarian goods to Iran. Their position is now unclear. The US has outlined plans to sanction the Central Bank of Iran (CBI); but it is inevitable that any local private Iranian bank will have to transact with the CBI. Under the current US sanctions framework it is unclear if this would trigger a designation for that local bank, meaning that European banks would most likely refuse to transact with that entity. Such uncertainty can effectively block payment channels into Iran and prevent life-saving assistance from reaching doctors and Iranian patients. Indeed, several leading pharmaceutical companies currently engaged in Iran have shared with us their concerns that banks, insurance companies, and distribution channels that have facilitated humanitarian trade with Iran are getting cold feet, fearing they could fall foul of US sanctions. Competing interpretations of the OFAC guidelines also are causing over-compliance by European companies whose board members are reluctant to accept reputational damage in the US even for humanitarian exchanges with Iran. Sanctions have repeatedly hit ordinary people the hardest and resulted in a negative impact on health in the targeted country For Iranians, access to basic healthcare is a constitutionally protected fundamental human right. In recent years, health conditions in Iran have been gradually improving for underprivileged patients. In part this has been due to the easing of international sanctions that have made healthcare products more affordable and easily accessible. President Hassan Rouhani’s government also introduced new reforms that offer healthcare to almost 11 million previously unprotected people. Treatment for chronic diseases is a major challenge for Iran where successful treatment requires advanced devices, training, and pharmaceuticals that are often provided through Western companies. Protecting access of such companies to Iran is therefore imperative. As global powers look to salvage the nuclear deal despite the US withdrawal, they should seek to preserve humanitarian trade with Iran. Despite opposing views between Europe and the US on the nuclear agreement, saving the lives of Iranians should not be a topic of debate. Brian Hook, the newly appointed US special representative for Iran, recently stated that the US and Europe should be working together to “find lasting solutions that truly support Iran’s people”. Europe should press the US to fulfil this offer by working to immediately facilitate and remove obstacles to humanitarian trade with Iran. European governments should urge the US Treasury to quickly clarify the ambiguities created by its latest guidelines and ensure that a reasonable number of Iranian private financial institutions remain exempt from US secondary sanctions. The European Union should double down on efforts to ensure payment channels with Iran are preserved, including Iran’s access to the SWIFT financial messaging service. As a matter of priority it should aim for banks in Europe to remain open for humanitarian trade with Iran. To help foreign companies sustain the profit margins of operations inside Iran, the Iranian government could also offer cost-saving incentives for companies that import medicine and medical goods into the country. The European Commission recently announced it will provide an €18m economic package for the social benefit of ordinary Iranians. If required, it should introduce similar new provisions after November to bridge any gaps in funding and payment facilities for medicine exported by European companies. This lending mechanism (in euros as opposed to US dollars), should be large enough to at least cover the import of life-saving medicine into Iran and should be flexible enough to respond to new needs. The EU and Iran could also consider establishing a medical fund for donating pharmaceuticals and equipment to Iran. In such instances, no banking transactions will be required and therefore the risks to European companies will be reduced. The EU could also encourage expanded scientific cooperation with Iran in medical research and training. Relative to many countries in the Middle East, Iran has advanced public and private medical research institutions that are likely to welcome such bilateral cooperation. In fact, Iranian and US scientists have long engaged in successful health diplomacy projects. European governments can support and facilitate such humanitarian-focused projects. Such measures from Europe can demonstrate that their commitment to the humanitarian needs of Iranian people goes beyond rhetoric. Many Western governments view sanctions as an effective economic tool to alter the actions of adversary states. Yet sanctions have repeatedly hit ordinary people the hardest and resulted in a negative impact on health in the targeted country. The human cost of sanctions in countries such as Iraq, Iran, Syria, and Venezuela has been severe. Going forward, the international community must implement safeguards to fully protect humanitarian sectors of trade. As Europe pledges to demonstrate its commitment to the Iran nuclear deal, it could take a lead in this dialogue and provide concrete solutions.

President Donald Trump’s unilateral decision to withdraw from the multilateral agreement to restrain Iran’s nuclear program will inevitably have far-reaching consequences, including the further destabilisation of the Middle East. More immediately, it risks fracturing a Western alliance that has provided the cornerstone of global security since the end of the second world war. In a joint statement , the leaders of France, Germany and Britain raised the possibility of the US being in breach of a United Nations Security Council resolution endorsing the deal. The resolution remained the “binding international legal framework for the resolution of the dispute,” Emmanuel Macron, Angela Merkel and Theresa May said.   Read more: Why Trump's decertification of the Iran nuclear deal may prove a costly mistake    As such, France, Germany and Britain said they would still adhere to the agreement. The other participants – Russia and China – would also be unlikely to abandon the deal. And Iran itself, in a measured reaction to the Trump announcement, said it, too, would stick with the agreement . This means the Trump administration risks finding itself further isolated from the international community, following his decision to also pull out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Paris Climate Change accords. It is hard to exaggerate the many negative outcomes that may well flow from the decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal, including an escalation of tensions between Iran and US clients in the Middle East. In fact, heightened tensions across the Middle East and an intensification of a regional arms race would seem to be almost inevitable. Following through on his threats during his 2016 presidential election campaign to tear up the Iran deal, Trump could hardly have been more explicit in his rejection of a foreign policy centrepiece of his predecessor’s tenure in his announcement on Tuesday. The fact is, this was a horrible, one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made. It didn’t bring calm, it didn’t bring peace, and it never will. What this announcement confirms – if confirmation is even necessary – is that the US leader has unshackled himself from the moderating influences of advisers who have been shoved out of his national security team in recent weeks. These include Harold McMaster, his former national security adviser, and former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who had both argued strenuously against a withdrawal from the Iran deal. Trump is now in the hands of what is one of the more bellicose teams of advisers assembled by an American president in recent memory. Where this leaves James Mattis, Trump’s defence secretary is unclear. Mattis has called the verification element of the Iran deal “robust” and has been opposed to actions that would undermine an existing treaty.   Read more: Donald Trump backs out of Iran nuclear deal: now what?    Understandably, former President Barack Obama and his secretary of state, John Kerry, have expressed dismay over an unravelling of an agreement that took years to negotiate with the aim of forestalling Iran’s acquisition of a nuclear weapons. In a rare rebuke of Trump, Obama said the decision would make the world less safe. He described it as a “losing choice between a nuclear-armed Iran or another war in the Middle East.” Understandably - as one of the architects of the agreement - Kerry also expressed his dismay . “Instead of building on unprecedented nonproliferation verification measures, this decision risks throwing them away and dragging the world back to the brink we faced a few years ago,” he said. In addition to tearing up the deal, Trump announced a re-imposition – and strengthening – of sanctions against Iran. These will be phased in over 90-day and 180-day periods. What is not clear is what impact these sanctions will have on international companies doing business in Iran. Under a previous sanctions regime, companies risked being shut out of the US economy if they invested in – or traded with – Iran. An interpretation of just what is implied for international business will be an early test of America’s ability to make the sanctions stick. This is sure to get messy. Already, US companies such as Boeing, which had negotiated US$20 billion in aircraft sales to Iran, are finding such business is now in jeopardy. Further complicating the picture is Trump’s proposed face-to-face meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un to put an end to Pyongyang’s nuclear program.

"Diplomats: EU Wrestling with Iran Nuclear Deal After American Exit","Head of Mission of People’s Republic of China to the European Union Hailong Wu, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarifat, an unidentified Russian official, British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry pose for a photo following negotiations between the P5+1 member nations and Iranian officials about the future of their country’s nuclear program at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne in Switzerland on April 2, 2015. US State Department Photo The Trump administration’s decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal leaves the European Union with the difficult choice of continuing to trade with Iran to keep up its end of the accord but also faces the loss of doing business in the United States, the EU ambassador to Washington said Wednesday. “I think Europe will live up to their commitment in the agreement,” as long as Iran does not resume its work on nuclear weapons. Daniel O’Sullivan said speaking at the Woodrow Wilson Center . He noted that the United Kingdom, France and Germany, for now, all part of the 28-member union, were signatories to the deal, along with Russia and China. All have signaled a willingness to keep the terms of the agreement in place. Lady Catherine Ashton, former vice president of the European Commission, said the agreement was unique because for the first time it brought all these nations working together on resolving a major international issue. With Trump’s decision, Russia, China, Germany, France and the United Kingdom “lose an incredibly important and vital partner” in keeping Iran from moving ahead with a nuclear weapons program to match its missile programs. Secondary sanctions, a threat by the United States to use against any company or nation continuing to trade with Iran, “is going to be a critical issue.” Complicating the relations further is the administration’s laying out the possibility of imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum shipped from the continent to the United States. O’Sullivan said several times during the Washington, D.C., forum that Iran expects an economic boost by opening up trade with other nations when it signed the agreement and lives by its literal terms. If push comes to shove on secondary sanctions for dealing with Iran, “business will make business decisions … in its own best interests,” Ashton predicted. O’Sullivan said so-called blocking actions could be taken by the EU to protect those businesses. By pulling out of the agreement because Iran is moving ahead with its ballistic and cruise missile programs, working surreptitiously to undermine governments in Yemen and other Gulf states, propping up the Syrian regime of Bashar al Assad and backing terrorists, “the U.S. is looking to change the terms of the deal,” O’Sullivan said. The more realistic course to follow was to negotiate these other points separately and keep the original agreement in place, both said in slightly different ways. O’Sullivan cited the recent visits by French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel to Washington urging the United States to work with them to negotiate the other issues with Iran. For all their differences over how to proceed with Iran and whether the American pullout of the nuclear agreement would have any impact on possible negotiations with the United States, the largest security concern for the Europeans remains Russia and what will be its next moves. O’Sullivan described the EU’s and the United States’ relationship with Russia as being a “slightly schizophrenic attitude.” On the one hand the Europeans and the United States “need to be tough and push back” against Russian aggression in Ukraine and Georgia by backing separatists in both nations and threatening other neighboring states on its western and southern borders. Ashton added in those cases and Russia’s attempted assassination by poisoning of a former spy in the United Kingdom it was essential “we stand together [and say] that’s not acceptable” by beefing up security forces and raising the economic price on the Kremlin and its leaders through a series of ever-tougher sanctions. Yet as this was going on, the EU and the United States did come together with Russia over an agreement with Iran on nuclear weapons and have worked together cooperatively in the Arctic, both diplomats agreed. O’Sullivan noted that Russia remains a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council with veto power over actions the Kremlin disagrees with and discussion on a broad range of issues between the West and Moscow were necessary to avoid misunderstanding that could lead to armed conflict. The question for the Europeans is what will their relationship be in 20 to 25 years, Ashton said. For countries on Russia’s borders, other Europeans need to realize that there are long economic and political ties and deep family connections across frontiers. “It’s about people-to-people” in the long view of events, she said.

"","Joint statement by M. Emmanuel Macron, President of the Republic, Ms Theresa May, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and Ms Angela Merkel, Chancellor of Germany [ 1 ] It is with regret and concern that we, the leaders of France, Germany and the United Kingdom, take note of President Trump’s decision to withdraw the United States of America from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. Together, we emphasize our continuing commitment to the JCPOA. This agreement remains important for our shared security. We recall that the JCPOA was unanimously endorsed by the UN Security Council in Resolution 2231. This resolution remains the binding international legal framework for the resolution of the dispute about the Iranian nuclear programme. We urge all sides to remain committed to its full implementation and to act in a spirit of responsibility. According to the IAEA, Iran continues to abide by the restrictions set out by the JCPOA, in line with its obligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The world is a safer place as a result. Therefore we, the E3, will remain parties to the JCPOA. Our governments remain committed to ensuring the agreement is upheld, and will work with all the remaining parties to the deal to ensure this remains the case, including through ensuring the continuing economic benefits to the Iranian people that are linked to the agreement. We urge the US to ensure that the structures of the JCPOA can remain intact, and to avoid taking action which obstructs its full implementation by all other parties to the deal. After engaging with the US Administration in a thorough manner over the past months, we call on the US to do everything possible to preserve the gains for nuclear non-proliferation brought about by the JCPOA, by allowing for a continued enforcement of its main elements. We encourage Iran to show restraint in response to the decision by the US; Iran must continue to meet its own obligations under the deal, cooperating fully and in a timely manner with IAEA inspection requirements. The IAEA must be able to continue to carry out its long-term verification and monitoring programme without restriction or hindrance. In turn, Iran should continue to receive the sanctions relief it is entitled to whilst it remains in compliance with the terms of the deal. There must be no doubt: Iran’s nuclear programme must always remain peaceful and civilian. While taking the JCPOA as a base, we also agree that other major issues of concern need to be addressed. A long-term framework for Iran’s nuclear programme after some of the provisions of the JCPOA expire, after 2025, will have to be defined. Because our commitment to the security of our allies and partners in the region is unwavering, we must also address in a meaningful way shared concerns about Iran’s ballistic missile programme and its destabilizing regional activities, especially in Syria, Iraq and Yemen. We have already started constructive and mutually beneficial discussions on these issues, and the E3 is committed to continuing them with key partners and concerned states across the region. We and our foreign ministers will reach out to all parties to the JCPOA to seek a positive way forward.

President Trump made an announcement from the White House, keeping his campaign promise, that the United States would withdraw from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, also known as the Iran nuclear deal. John Fritze reports. John Fritze, USA TODAY WASHINGTON – As he announced Tuesday that he would no longer abide by the Iran nuclear deal, President Trump sent a not-so-veiled message to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. "Today's action sends a critical message: The United States no longer makes empty threats. When I make promises, I keep them," Trump said. Even as he spoke, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was on his way to the Korean Peninsula to lay the groundwork for talks about North Korea's nuclear program. "Plans are being made; relationships are building. Hopefully, a deal will happen," Trump said. The very same issues that caused Trump to pull out of the Iran agreement will also be hurdles in North Korea talks — and in some cases, those hurdles will be higher. Unlike Iran, North Korea already has nuclear weapons. "Ripping up the Iran deal will demonstrate to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un that a deal with the United States can't be counted on. And it will give Kim Jong Un less incentive to make important concessions," said Robert Einhorn of the Brookings Institution, a former State Department adviser on arms control during the Obama administration. Einhorn said Trump's position on the Iran deal could box him in on negotiations with North Korea. On sanctions relief, human rights and missile technology, Trump may be setting a standard on Iran that could be impossible to reach on a North Korea deal. Trump has four major problems with the Iran deal, which was negotiated by President Obama and five other world powers and is formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. •The JCPOA didn't address Iran's ballistic missile program. •It didn't stop Iran's misbehavior in the Middle East. • Provisions of the agreement expire after 10 to 15 years. •It rewarded Iran by unfreezing its assets frozen by years of U.S. sanctions.  Trump is moving quickly toward a historic summit with Kim in the coming weeks, bypassing the years of lower-level talks that preceded the Iran nuclear deal. "The location is picked — the time and the date, everything is picked," Trump said. An Obama-era law requires Trump to make a decision on Iran sanctions every 120 days. The previous time he faced that deadline, Trump waived the sanctions. Tuesday, he signed a presidential memorandum to pull out of the agreement, allowing him to impose the sanctions. "They're not formally linked, but clearly, they’re linked in many people's minds. They're two rogue regimes on different parts of the timeline toward developing a nuclear program," said Bruce Klingner, a former CIA analyst on North Korea now at the conservative Heritage Foundation. Because North Korea is further along on that timeline — it's  suspected of having a nuclear stockpile of as many as 60 warheads — Iran and other potential nuclear states will watch to see what Kim can get away with. "The Trump administration has set a very high bar for success and painted itself into a corner through its very strong opposition — to not just the JCPOA but other agreements with North Korea," Klingner said. An agreement in 1994 with North Korea, negotiated by the Clinton administration and known as the Agreed Framework, slowed North Korea's nuclear program for eight years. The pact collapsed during the George W. Bush administration — in part because of North Korean provocations, but the United States didn't live up to its promise to help North Korea develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. "One would think that the U.S. pulling out of the Iran deal would undermine North Korea's perception that it could trust the U.S. to maintain any kind of agreement with it," Klingner said. "The North Koreans already think that the U.S. political system is fickle. We change our policy every four to eight years." That cuts both ways. Just as Iran learned that a U.S. president might not maintain an agreement his predecessor made, both countries may calculate that the next U.S. president might give them a better deal.","https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/05/08/iran-nuclear-deal-what-does-trumps-move-mean-north-korea-talks/586711002/"
"Follow B&B","asdasdasdasdasdasdasdasdasdasd France, the United Kingdom, and Germany (the ‘E3’) appear set to intensify ongoing talks with the US in an effort to convince Donald Trump to stick to the Iran nuclear deal. Trump has threatened to withdraw from the agreement in May unless certain preconditions were met. Europeans hope the ongoing discussions will be able to find a middle way to both safeguard the nuclear deal and address outstanding areas of concern with Iran, such as on missiles and regional issues. However, Trump’s recent nomination of Mike Pompeo as US secretary of state increases the risk that this approach will backfire on Europe. European policymakers largely viewed Rex Tillerson as a voice of moderation within the White House and as someone who, together with secretary of defense James Mattis, influenced Trump towards a more pragmatic position on Iran. If Europe is serious about saving the nuclear deal, then the appointment of Pompeo, an Iran-hawk in Washington , should serve as an urgent prompt to rethink its current strategy. Some in European policy circles hoped that Trump’s statement on the nuclear deal on 12 January this year was part of his maximalist negotiating tactics, and that if Europe showed some flexibility, the president would be climb down from these demands. But one of the reasons Trump cited when firing Tillerson was their disagreement over the Iran nuclear deal. This should indicate that the moderate voices in the White House have been unable to bridge gaps between Trump and Europe over the nuclear deal. Trump, meanwhile, remarked on the “ very similar thought process ” he and Pompeo share on a number of issues. Pompeo has been especially outspoken on Iran: he opposed the nuclear deal, supported regime change, and downplayed the costs of war with Iran. With Pompeo now in charge of US diplomacy, Europeans are likely to face a tougher and non-accommodating negotiating posture from the Trump administration over the nuclear deal. This comes against a backdrop of rising regional tensions between Iran and Israel , in addition to repeated pledges from Trump to confront Iran, most recently in his Nowruz message marking the Iranian new year. Trump’s deal-making during his term in office should create doubt as to whether he would actually implement a side framework agreement of the type that his administration is currently seeking to strike with Europe over Iran policy. On foreign policy matters, Trump has remained dangerously unpredictable, and threatened everything from trade war to nuclear war. The pattern of negotiations between his administration and the US Congress over immigration and healthcare suggests that, even if Trump’s counterparts make concessions to fulfil his demands, there is no guarantee that he will, in the end, accept it. Europeans should therefore be clear-eyed about the chances of success of current talks with the United States. Based on recent precedent, Trump is likely to perceive Europe’s flexibility and accommodation over Iran policy as a weakness that he can exploit to raise the benchmarks of demands. Moreover, by threatening imminent withdrawal from the nuclear deal, Trump is increasingly pressuring the E3 to jump on board with his efforts to undermine the agreement. Republican lawmakers such as Senator Bob Corker have also adopted this stance and warned that, unless the E3 sign up to the side framework agreement that meets US demands, Trump is unlikely to extend sanctions waivers due in May. Yet, in their attempt to save the nuclear agreement through reaching a broader understanding with the Trump administration on Iran policy, the E3 must ensure that Europe does not become complicit in hollowing out the nuclear agreement. So far, the International Atomic Energy Agency has repeatedly verified that Iran is fulfilling its nuclear-related obligations. However, Iran has firmly indicated it will take reciprocal action to match any US backtracking from the deal. A potential side agreement between the E3 and the US with respect to the nuclear deal therefore risks a tit-for-tat exchange between Tehran and Washington that could alter and muddy their respective commitments under the agreement and cumulatively cause it to unravel. In light of Pompeo’s appointment, the E3 should harden their negotiating tactics on the nuclear deal in ways that match the mindset of the Trump administration. First, Europeans should take a unified and more assertive position in forthcoming talks with the US to underscore that they will not be party to, nor accept as permissible, violations of a multilateral and United Nations Security Council-enshrined agreement. The E3 should continue to outline that it will not, and indeed cannot, alter expiration dates of the terms in the nuclear deal (so-called “sunset provisions”) as Trump has demanded. If Trump wants to kill the deal, he must take full responsibility, and Europe should avoid guilt by association. Second, Europe should continue to show openness to working with the US administration on a follow-up to the nuclear agreement with Iran once the current deal has reached a more mature stage of implementation. The E3 should also have a candid exchange with Iran on regional security and demonstrate to the Trump administration that a range of tools exists to address concerns related to Iran. But in return for this flexibility, Europeans should outline an expectation that Washington will adhere to its existing obligations under the multilateral agreement and minimize the unpredictability surrounding Trump’s waivers of sanctions. The sequencing of European measures and flexibility will be important to strengthening the E3’s position. For example, the European Union should first receive firm assurances that Trump will waive nuclear-related sanctions in May before it even debates the tougher measures against Iran’s missiles program proposed by the US and reportedly supported by the E3 during a meeting with EU foreign ministers on Monday this week. The E3 should also consider how political and legislative measures within the US could better guarantee US commitments to the nuclear deal. This could entail extensions in the length of time between each waiver of US secondary sanctions related to Iran’s nuclear program (thereby easing the unpredictability surrounding Trump’s actions), and pressing for progress in the Airbus aviation deals with Iran explicitly permitted under the nuclear deal. Third, Europeans should prepare for the worst-case scenario – namely, a US withdrawal from the agreement and snap-back sanctions in May – and minimise the damage that will ensue. Pompeo’s appointment should be a trigger for European policymakers and companies to step up contingency planning to salvage the deal even without the US. For Iran to continue implementing the restrictions on its nuclear program, there must be a degree of political and economic incentives. As outlined elsewhere , Europe could provide this package to Iran by using a range of political and technical tools that ring-fence companies from the enforcement of US secondary sanctions through legal carve-outs, sector-specific exemptions, political understandings, and reviving the EU Blocking Regulation. In current talks with the US, Europe should privately stress its willingness to pursue alternative options to preserve the nuclear agreement. A significant benefit of outlining a contingency plan at this stage is the deterrence impact it may have on Trump’s decision to kill the deal through highlighting the isolation the US would face. In short, Europe should outline, as it has done on the issue of trade and the Paris climate accord, that it will work with like-minded coalitions to fill the gaps left by US withdrawal. This strategy may not, in the end, alter the decision by Trump to execute his campaign promise to “dismantle” the “disastrous deal” with Iran. But this approach at least provides Europe with the political capital to try to salvage the agreement and thereby secure its own non-proliferation goals. If Iran’s nuclear program expands in respond to Trump’s withdrawal, other regional powers, such as Saudi Arabia, have warned that they will do the same. A firm European position in defense of the diplomatic accord may also reduce the growing risk of confrontation between Washington and Tehran in the Middle East, for which Europe will inevitably bear the cost. This approach also sets a precedent that Europe is a credible international partner, demonstrating political willingness to safeguard international norms at a time when global leadership is lacking.

"Iran Rallies Against U.S. and Warns Europe Over Endangered Nuclear Deal","Advertisement Supported by By  Thomas Erdbrink and Rick Gladstone TEHRAN — Iran’s hard-line authorities organized nationwide rallies on Friday to denounce the Trump administration’s withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear agreement, burning American flags and warning that Europe might further sabotage the accord. The reaction reflected the view held by many hard-liners that the American withdrawal had vindicated their suspicions that Westerners were treacherous. The anger on display in Tehran and other cities also reinforced the possibility that Iran would now abandon the agreement as well, restarting the nuclear-fuel enrichment that it had halted. Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami, a well-known hard-liner who leads the Friday Prayer services in Tehran, admonished fellow citizens against making any deals with foreigners “since they cannot be trusted.” In his sermon, broadcast on state television, Ayatollah Khatami also criticized Iranian politicians who have looked toward Europe to preserve the nuclear agreement, arguing that the Europeans, too, have broken promises. The outpouring of anger, in demonstrations organized around the country, was the most strident so far to President Trump’s announcement on Tuesday that he was abandoning the nuclear agreement reached with Iran and other major powers three years ago. The agreement relaxed or ended many economic restrictions on Iran in return for its verifiable pledges to never make nuclear weapons, including a freeze on nuclear fuel production for at least 15 years. Mr. Trump called the agreement too weak and described it as a shameful giveaway to Iran by his predecessor, Barack Obama. Mr. Trump’s announcement restored onerous American sanctions on Iran, including penalties for foreign companies that do business with that country. His announcement was widely criticized around the world but drew praise from Iran’s regional enemies, Israel and Saudi Arabia. While European governments have said they want to preserve the accord, the participation of the United States was widely considered to be crucial to its survival. Even before Mr. Trump announced the pullout, non-American businesses were wary about making any financial commitments in Iran, fearful of such an outcome. Many Iranians, who had hoped the nuclear accord would bring a flood of investment and business to the country of 80 million, have been deeply disappointed. Reminding Iranians of this point, Ayatollah Khatami said Europeans had been expected to invest in Iran after the nuclear agreement took effect but most never did. He exhorted listeners to shout “Death to America!” and “Death to Israel!” In response to what Israel has described as its aerial assaults on Iranian bases in Syria, Ayatollah Khatami also said that Iran would “rob the Israeli regime of sleep” and threatened to “raze Tel Aviv and Haifa to the ground.” The American withdrawal from the nuclear accord is considered a serious political blow to Hassan Rouhani, Iran’s president, who had promised that the agreement would end the country’s prolonged isolation and economic travails. The withdrawal also reinforced the anti-American hostility of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, who reluctantly had gone along with Mr. Rouhani and his nuclear negotiators. The mood at Friday Prayer services was defiant in Tehran, where men burned American flags. One worshiper, Hassan Khedri, 24, with spiky hair and a sleeveless shirt, said: “I am an Iranian Kurd and I am ready to fight with America and Israel. I only wait for the command of the chief commander, our Supreme Leader Khamenei.” Another worshiper, Hasan Biagi, 65, said the threat to the nuclear agreement caused by the American pullout showed the true faces of Iran’s enemies. “We cannot even rely on Europe,” he said. “This is a big lesson for us. Never trust the West.” The mistrust was an underlying theme in a statement issued by the government on Thursday denouncing what it called Mr. Trump’s “new extremist administration” for exiting the agreement. “Mr. Trump’s absurd insults against the great Iranian nation indicate the extent of his ignorance and folly,” the statement said. Warning the agreement’s European participants — Britain, France and Germany — the statement said they “must take the necessary action to safeguard the accord and to implement their commitments — which they proved incapable of fully performing even while the U.S. was nominally a party to the deal.” Ayatollah Khamenei also expressed skepticism about whether the Europeans would keep their word. In a speech on Wednesday to teachers in Tehran, he hinted that the nuclear agreement would fail. “I do not trust these three countries either,” he said. “Do not trust them. If you want to sign a contract, ask for actual guarantees. I swear to God, they will do the same thing that the Americans did.” Resentment and resistance toward Mr. Trump’s decision also appeared to be deepening in Europe, where many officials view it as an arrogant act that could force European companies to acquiesce to American policy toward Iran. “Do we want the United States to be the world’s economic gendarme?” Bruno Le Maire, France’s minister of economy and finances, said on the Europe 1 radio station. “Or do we Europeans want to say: ‘We have economic interests, we want to continue trading with Iran within the framework of a strategic agreement. We believe that this is the right approach, so we will continue.’” Even so, there were new signs on Friday that some big non-American companies were heeding the White House’s warning to wind down commercial commitments in Tehran. The Treasury Department, which oversees American sanctions policy, has given businesses 90 to 180 days before it starts enforcing penalties. Two leading shipping companies, Maersk Line and MSC, said they were reviewing their Iran operations, and Indonesia’s state energy company, Pertamina, said it might delay a contract to operate Iran’s Mansouri oil field, Reuters reported. The American restoration of sanctions also annulled the export licenses of leading aerospace companies to sell commercial aircraft to Iran, upending multibillion-dollar orders won by Boeing and Airbus. Boeing has played down the fallout , saying it had not committed to any production for Iran. Airbus, which has already delivered a few aircraft to Iran, has not specified what it will do. Although Airbus is a European company, it needs an American export license because Airbus planes contain some American components. “We’re carefully analyzing the president’s announcement and will be evaluating next steps consistent with our internal policies and in full compliance with U.S. sanctions and export control regulations,” Airbus said in an emailed statement. “That analysis could take a bit of time.” Thomas Erdbrink reported from Tehran, and Rick Gladstone from New York.

"Air France, British Airways and KLM to Suspend Routes to Tehran","August 25, 2018  Andy Nelson  Airlines  Three of Europe’s largest carriers have announced they plan to end flights to Tehran, the Iranian capital, citing lack of demand and poor financial performance. The final flights in September will mark the end of such routes that were only reintroduced two years ago after Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal framework was agreed upon with a host of world powers. The flag carriers of the U.K. and The Netherlands currently operate several weekly services from their respective hubs at London Heathrow and Amsterdam Schipol to Tehran’s Imam Khomeini International Airport (IKA), with Air France’s subsidiary Joon – ‘the airline for millennials’ – operating once a week from Charles de Gaulle in Paris. KLM said last month that the suspension of its flights to Tehran was a consequence of “negative results and financial outlook”, with British Airways issuing a statement to say “We are suspending our London to Tehran service as the operation is currently not commercially viable”, sentiments that were echoed almost to the letter by Air France/Joon. All three airlines resumed operations to Iran following 2015’s deal, which saw an increase in tourism both to and from a country whose diplomatic relationships with many nations of the world in modern times has, to put it lightly, been turbulent. There was no open admission that the move was in any way related to U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to reimpose sanctions on Iran, a decision that has affected foreign business operations in the country. But whether or not these, or any other airlines will admit it, it’s inevitable that the decision will have a significant financial impact. Several European carriers will continue operating flights to Tehran, most notably Germany’s Lufthansa, Austrian Airlines – which is owned by Lufthansa – and Germania, which operates a narrowbody fleet to Tehran from its base in Berlin. None of these airlines have, as of yet, given any indication that their services will be similarly suspended.   #mc_embed_signup{background:#fff; clear:left; font:14px Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; }

"John Bolton will reportedly meet with Israeli national security adviser to ratify joint approach to Iran","US National Security Adviser John Bolton will reportedly meet with his Israeli counterpart, Meir Ben-Shabat, in Washington on Tuesday to discuss a joint approach to Iran. Sources briefed on the trip told Israel's Channel 10 reporter Barak Ravid that the two officials will be ratifying an existing agreement between Israel and the US on how to deal with Iran. The agreement was reportedly reached in December last year and seeks joint coordination to counter Iran's missile program and its proxy network across the Middle East. Sources said the two national security advisers will make changes to the agreement that reflect the "new reality" of the US no longer being party to the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran. Earlier this month, the US formally withdrew from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal , which lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for limits on its nuclear program. President Donald Trump said the deal had "serious flaws" and would not prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Sources added that Bolton and Ben-Shabat will also discuss joint military cooperation in countering Iran's presence in Syria. The move comes as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu prepares to discuss Iran with several European leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron, and UK Prime Minister Theresa May, next week . The three countries remain parties to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, and are scrambling to save the deal's framework . Iran has laid out its conditions for remaining in the deal with Europe, but is not yet known whether Europe's leading powers would be likely to concede the demands.","https://www.businessinsider.com/john-bolton-meeting-israel-about-iran-2018-5"
"Iran Agrees to Detailed Nuclear Outline, First Step Toward a Wider Deal","Advertisement Supported by By  Michael R. Gordon and David E. Sanger LAUSANNE, Switzerland — Iran and the United States, along with five other world powers, announced on Thursday a surprisingly specific and comprehensive understanding on limiting Tehran’s nuclear program for the next 15 years, though they left several specific issues to a final agreement in June. After two years of negotiations, capped by eight tumultuous days and nights of talks that appeared on the brink of breakdown several times, Secretary of State John Kerry and his Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif, announced the plan, which, if carried out, would keep Iran’s nuclear facilities open under strict production limits, and which holds the potential of reordering America’s relationship with a country that has been an avowed adversary for 35 years. Mr. Kerry and Energy Secretary Ernest J. Moniz, a nuclear scientist who played a crucial role in the last stages of the negotiations, said the pact satisfied their primary goal of ensuring that Iran, if it decided to, could not race for a nuclear weapon in less than a year, although those constraints against “breakout” would be in effect only for the first decade of the accord. President Obama, for whom remaking the American relationship with Iran has been a central objective since his 2008 campaign, stepped into the Rose Garden moments later to celebrate what he called “a historic understanding with Iran.” He warned Republicans in Congress that if they tried to impose new sanctions to undermine the effort, the United States would be blamed for a diplomatic failure. He insisted that the deal “cuts off every pathway” for Iran to develop a nuclear weapon and establishes the most intrusive inspection system in history. “If Iran cheats,” he said, “the world will know it.” Under the accord, Iran agreed to cut the number of operating centrifuges it has by two-thirds, to 5,060, all of them first-generation, and to cut its current stockpile of low-enriched uranium from around 10,000 kilograms to 300 for 15 years. An American description of the deal also referred to inspections “anywhere in the country” that could “investigate suspicious sites or allegations of a covert enrichment facility.” But in a briefing, American officials talked about setting up a mechanism to resolve disputes that has not been explained in any detail. In a move not seen since before the Iranian revolution in 1979, and to the surprise of many in both countries, Iranian government broadcasters aired Mr. Obama’s comments live. In parts of Tehran, people cheered and honked car horns as they began to contemplate a life without sanctions on oil and financial transactions, though the issue of when the sanctions are to be removed looms as one of the potential obstacles to a final agreement on June 30. If that hurdle and the problem of ridding Iran of its huge nuclear fuel stockpile can be fully resolved in the next three months, the preliminary accord will still need to be sold to Iran’s neighbors. The prospect of a deal has inflamed Israel and the Gulf states, alarmed by Iranian muscle-flexing in the Middle East, most recently in Iraq, Syria and Yemen. There is so much concern that Mr. Obama, in a phone call today to King Salman of Saudi Arabia, invited Arab leaders to Camp David this spring to discuss Iran and the turmoil in the region. Analysts have long been worried that Saudi Arabia and other Arab states might mount their own nuclear programs if they decide that Iran is being allowed to retain too much of its nuclear infrastructure. In a telephone call from Air Force One on Thursday afternoon, Mr. Obama told Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, that while the deal was not final, it “represents significant progress towards a lasting, comprehensive solution that cuts off all of Iran’s pathways to a bomb and verifiably ensures the peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear program going forward,” according to an account of the conversation from the White House. Mr. Netanyahu, a strong critic of the deal, was apparently not mollified, and released a statement saying, “A deal based on this framework would threaten the survival of Israel.” Mr. Zarif, for his part, was careful to play down the notion that anything agreed to here would remake the relationship. Any hint of a broader rapprochement is an enormously sensitive issue among hard-liners in the Iranian military and clerical leaders who have made opposition to the United States the centerpiece of their political narratives. “Iran-U.S. relations have nothing to do with this,” Mr. Zarif said emphatically at a university here, where the agreement was announced. “This was an attempt to resolve the nuclear issue.” While saying he hoped the two countries would find a way to melt away their distrust as the agreement was carried out, he hastened to add, “We have serious differences with the United States.” Now, attention will shift to Mr. Obama and Hassan Rouhani, the Iranian president, who was elected on a platform of ending sanctions. They share a common task: selling the agreement at home to constituencies deeply suspicious of both the deal and the prospect of signing any accord with an avowed enemy. The White House has promised a lobbying campaign by the president unlike any seen since he pushed through health care legislation. Mr. Zarif and other Iranian officials may have an even harder political argument to win. They will have to overcome objections in the military and scientific establishments, especially because the accord will force them to cut the number of centrifuges enriching uranium by half, put thousands of others in storage and convert two other facilities into research sites that would have virtually no fissile material — the makings of an atom bomb. Iran has insisted that its nuclear program is for civilian uses only. Mr. Zarif seemed to sense the scope of the challenge in how he framed the agreement. He focused on the fact that Iran would not have to dismantle any facilities — something Washington had initially demanded, especially after helping expose one such secret facility, called Fordo, in Mr. Obama’s first year in office. When, late on Thursday, the White House began distributing a description of what amounted to Iranian concessions, an obviously angry Mr. Zarif challenged the American accounting in several posts on Twitter. Whether Iran is racing toward nuclear weapon capabilities is one of the most contentious foreign-policy issues challenging the West. “There is no need to spin using ‘fact sheets’ so early on,” he wrote in one , only an hour or so after. In another, he suggested that sanctions would have to be lifted far earlier than one might think listening to Mr. Kerry, saying that, in essence, all the economic sanctions would be lifted once a final agreement was signed. That could be another issue for the two sides, in that Washington has insisted that the sanctions be removed in a step-by-step manner as Iran fulfills its obligations under the agreement. At another point, Mr. Zarif cautioned that no one had signed anything in Lausanne, and “nobody has obligations now.” That would come after a final agreement. A guide to help you navigate the deal between global powers and Tehran. Another problem for Mr. Zarif is that the deal he has agreed to is far more restrictive than one he outlined last July in an interview with The New York Times . At that time, he envisioned essentially keeping Iran’s stockpiles and its sprawling nuclear facilities at the levels they are running under a temporary agreement struck 18 months ago. What he agreed to in Lausanne, at least according to those fact sheets, would drastically cut Iran’s capability for 10 years and then allow it to build up gradually for the next five. After that, Iran would be free to produce as much uranium as it wishes — even building the 190,000 centrifuges that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei talked about last summer. That is bound to be a major concern for Congress, the Israelis and the Arab states, because it amounts to a bet that after 15 years, Iran will be a far more cooperative international player, perhaps under different management. The 5,060 centrifuges is a far higher figure than the administration originally envisioned, when it argued that Iran could possess only a few hundred. But in the final negotiations, Mr. Moniz and his Iranian counterpart, Ali Akbar Salehi, the M.I.T.-educated head of Iran’s atomic energy agency, agreed that Iran would drastically cut its stockpile of nuclear fuel, from about eight tons to a little over 600 pounds. The giant underground enrichment site at Fordo, which Israeli and some American officials fear is impervious to bombing, would be partly converted to advanced nuclear research and the production of medical isotopes. About two thirds of its centrifuges would be removed. Eventually, foreign scientists would be present. It would have no fissile material that could be used to make a bomb. But perhaps the most important compromise came in a lengthy battle over whether Iran would be allowed to conduct research and development on advanced centrifuges, which are far more efficient than current models. The Iranians won the right to research, but not to use more modern machines for production for the next 10 years. At Arak, which officials feared could produce plutonium, another pathway to a bomb, Iran agreed to redesign a heavy-water reactor in a way that would keep it from producing weapons-usable fuel. Those conditions impressed two of the most skeptical experts on the negotiations: Gary Samore and Olli Heinonen of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard and members of a group called United Against Nuclear Iran. Mr. Samore, who was Mr. Obama’s top adviser on weapons of mass destruction in his first term as president, said in an email that the deal was a “very satisfactory resolution of Fordo and Arak issues for the 15-year term” of the accord. He had more questions about operations at Natanz and said there was “much detail to be negotiated, but I think it’s enough to be called a political framework.” Mr. Heinonen, the former chief inspector of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said, “It appears to be a fairly comprehensive deal with most important parameters.” But he cautioned that “Iran maintains enrichment capacity which will be beyond its near-term needs.” Thomas Erdbrink contributed reporting from Tehran, and Julie Hirschfeld Davis from Washington. video Advertisement","https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/03/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-talks.html"
"Europe must develop a Middle East policy independent of the US","Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly called on Europe to take part in the reconstruction of Syria - in essence, a nice way of asking Europeans to foot the bill for the destruction and chaos that Russia, and particularly its client the Assad regime, have caused. Likewise, the US has traditionally asked Europe to shoulder its fair share when it comes to security and foreign policy - President Donald Trump even expressed this demand in an undiplomatic way. Middle Eastern states and civil society organisations also frequently urge the Europeans to engage more with the region, but for different purposes. It is an irony of history that Europe, which played the primary role in creating the modern Middle East, now comes across as an impotent power in the face of dramatically changing regional geopolitics. Given current trends, however, impotency isn’t something that European powers can afford in their foreign policies towards the Middle East and North Africa region. For better or for worse, Europe and the Middle East will mutually shape each other. Since the Suez crisis of 1956, in which the US publicly forced former colonial powers, Britain and France, to succumb to its will, Europe’s foreign and security policy towards the region has become largely US-centric - but such dependence on the US is no longer feasible when it comes to Middle Eastern issues. Not only is the US no longer interested in playing its traditional role vis-a-vis regional security, but its declared policies are clearly undermining European interests. The loss of a US-centred framework should engender a real debate among pundits in Europe on the ideal framework for European foreign, security and defence policy The US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal - along with its unilateral recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, uncritical support of Saudi Arabia and the UAE in their catastrophic war in Yemen, and hasty decisions about military withdrawal from Syria - have all contrasted with Europe’s declared positions, undermining its interests and security. The loss of a US-centred framework should engender a real debate among pundits in Europe on the ideal framework for European foreign, security and defence policy, particularly concerning the Middle East. Across the region militarisation is taking place at multiple levels. Armed non-state actors and militias are increasingly accessing weapons easily, including sophisticated ones with powerful capabilities, while the arms race among regional powers is continuing at a staggering pace. The Gulf in particular has become awash with all types of weapons; it is arguably the most profitable place for weapons and the arms industry worldwide. Weapons are increasingly being purchased in an unconditional manner and from different sources. This paves the way for disastrous results, as is evident in the catastrophic Saudi-UAE war in Yemen. The region has also become peppered with foreign military bases. On top of the traditional presence of Western military actors, Russia, China and India are enlarging their military footprints in the greater Middle East region. Capitalising on its Syria campaign, Russia is eyeing a bigger share of the regional arms market and a larger military presence, be it in Syria, Egypt or Libya .   Tanks of the Saudi-led coalition are deployed in the coastal district of Dhubab, Yemen, on 7 January 2017 (AFP)  While in 2015, MENA countries accounted for 36 percent of Russian arms exports and ranked as the second-largest market after the Asia-Pacific region, by late 2017, MENA had become the largest market for Russian arms exports - accounting for half of the country’s military exports. Russia is currently assertive on both the eastern and southern borders of Europe; thus, Europe needs to devise a foreign and security policy that takes into account the interconnectedness of its security challenges. China’s naval bases in Gwadar in Pakistan and Djibouti on the Red Sea are also likely to have implications for regional security. Following the same trend and reflecting the Sino-Indian geopolitical rivalry in the Indian Ocean, India last year signed a defence cooperation agreement with Oman, allowing the Indian navy to use Oman's port of Duqm. Regional powers are also increasingly setting up their own military bases in the region: Turkey’s bases in Somalia and Qatar, and the UAE’s in Somaliland, Eritrea and Yemen, are reflective of this trend. The contemporary Middle East is no longer the geopolitically US-centric space that the Europeans once knew. Europe can respond in several ways: proceed with its largely ad-hoc, incoherent and crisis-driven policies of recent years; continue to be incorporated into someone else's game plan, as with the French-German involvement in the Russian-led Astana process for Syria; or craft a more coherent policy towards the region, with a strong emphasis on democratisation, reform, good governance, inclusion and reconciliation. As the contest over the future of Middle East continues at full steam, Europe needs to devise a more long-term, values-informed foreign policy towards the region. On one hand, the persistence of authoritarian regimes - with all their attendant brutality, illegitimacy and inefficacy - makes many believe that not much has changed in the region’s politics and power structure. Yet, a closer examination shows the region has undergone a profound and irreversible transformation. Regional authoritarianism is on much shakier ground today than in the past, and not because these regimes are lacking the means or the will to suppress public dissent. Rather, it is a transformation in the political psychology of the people that makes the future of these authoritarian regimes uncertain. Despite their utmost brutality, these regimes cannot acquire people’s consent to their rule, rendering the autocrats more paranoid and their longevity in doubt. Egypt’s recent ban on yellow vests in the aftermath of the French protests clearly demonstrates how paranoid and insecure the Sisi regime has become. The contest over the nature and future of the regional order, and the Middle East’s relations with the international system, is far from over - and Europe shouldn’t be a bystander. The outcome of this contest will have a significant impact not only on Europe-Middle East relations, but also on domestic politics in European countries. Not only European action, but also European inaction, will have major results on both shores of the Mediterranean If Europe doesn’t engage and invest in the transformation of the Middle East, regional developments will dramatically transform it, whether through radicalism, refugees, terrorism, xenophobia or populism. Interactions between Europe and the Middle East will be transformative, for better or for worse. Not only European action, but also European inaction, will have major results on both shores of the Mediterranean. The need for a debate on the framework, instruments and objectives of a European policy towards the Middle East is more urgent than ever.

"","When it comes to claim payouts, King Price and Absa are among the local insurers who have the unhappiest clients. Jan Bornman President Cyril Ramaphosa. (GCIS) (Siyabulela Duda)  Multimedia · User Galleries · News in Pictures  Send us your pictures · Send us your stories  President Cyril Ramaphosa has noted "with deep concern" the United States of America's decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal, calling it a step back. US President Donald Trump announced on Tuesday that his country would withdraw from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) between the P5 +1 and the Islamic Republic of Iran. The P5 + 1 was made up of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council which are China, France, Russia, United Kingdom, United States—plus Germany. Ramaphosa said: "As a matter of principle, and deeply rooted in its foreign policy, South Africa supports multilateral diplomacy and the peaceful resolution of conflict." "The JCPOA is a significant achievement in this regard. It provides a framework of confidence under which the Islamic Republic of Iran can pursue the development of its nuclear capabilities for civilian purposes." He said the agreement was established in the interest of regional and international peace and security. "It is important that the progress made over many years of negotiation should not be lost," Ramaphosa said. "Since its adoption, the JCPOA has contributed significantly to the reduction of tensions over Iran's nuclear programme and still has an important role to play in promoting peace, stability and the normalisation of relations." Ramaphosa said the South African government urged the other parties of the JCPOA to continue to honour their commitments under the agreement. He added that, despite the US government withdrawing from the agreement, it should not prevent the remaining parties from honouring their commitments to the agreement. "In this regard, the decision of the United States should not prevent the remaining parties from honouring their commitments, nor should it impact negatively on the relevant structures and mechanisms created by the JCPOA," he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24 .

"Implementing the Iran Nuclear Deal: A Status Report","One year since its “implementation day”, 16 January 2016, the July 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany (the P5+1) — The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) — is both a success and in jeopardy. It has delivered so far on its narrow objective: effectively and verifiably blocking all potential pathways for Iran to race toward nuclear weapons, while opening the door to the country’s international rehabilitation and economic recovery. But in its transactional nature lies the accord’s vulnerability: it has not begun to transform the enmity between Iran and the U.S., leaving it exposed to an unstable political environment. If Iran still deems the deal in its national interest, it should not only adhere to its letter and spirit, but also move away from regional zero-sum pursuits. The Trump administration will face a starker choice. It could scuttle the deal, deliberately or by neglect; it should seek to make it stronger for all by a better-for-better bargain. Over the past year, internal polarisation in Tehran and Washington about the accord’s merits often overshadowed what really matters: that it is working and delivering concrete results. It has put Iran’s nuclear program under the most stringent inspection mechanism ever implemented, while lengthening the breakout time to produce weapons-grade uranium from a few weeks to more than a year. Since January 2016, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has verified six times that Iran has fulfilled its JCPOA obligations. The relaxation of U.S., European Union (EU) and UN nuclear-related sanctions has allowed Iran to regain oil market share, recover billions in frozen assets and attract foreign direct investment, turning its once shrinking economy into the region’s fastest growing. Yet, implementation, as with any complex technical agreement, has not been flawless. Iran committed several technical violations, none, alone or together, material. Paradoxically, they proved the accord’s efficacy: the IAEA quickly detected each and Iran remedied it. There have been more serious problems with sanctions relief. Iran still lacks normal international banking ties, as major financial institutions remain circumspect, hampering its reintegration into the global economy and dashing inflated public expectations of rapid economic recovery. Each side accuses the other of dragging its feet or failing to put its house in order, but causes of sanctions relief delays are manifold. One is bewildering red tape, which renders due diligence too costly and cumbersome for risk-averse firms. No less chilling for investment is the real threat of sanctions “snapback” if the agreement collapses. Iran failed to pave the ground for the great economic opening it promised its people. With rampant corruption, opaque ownership structures, poor physical infrastructure and an unwieldy legal and regulatory environment, it remains a difficult place to do business. Political in-fighting in Tehran and volatility in Washington deepen uncertainties. The most consequential political wildcard remains the U.S. Congress, where hostility toward Iran runs deep, and new sanctions are being considered. This is because of concerns over Iran’s regional resurgence and ballistic-missile tests, but the accord could not have been negotiated successfully if those issues had been on the table. Today they constitute the primary threat to its successful implementation. This, in turn, is because the JCPOA’s transformational potential has not yet materialised in the face of powerful stakeholders who moved to ensure it was a ceiling on, not a foundation for, détente between Iran, its neighbours and the U.S. The conundrum is that without addressing the broader political antagonism that pits Iran against its neighbours and the West, the JCPOA at best will remain fragile and its implementation halting, but without full implementation, resolving the underlying political antagonism may prove impossible. The most troubling uncertainty is the new U.S. administration’s approach. During the campaign, Donald Trump condemned the JCPOA as “the worst deal ever negotiated”. As president, he can repudiate it or refrain from the steps necessary to sustain it. But killing the accord or allowing it to die when Iran is in compliance would lead the other signatories — representing a near international consensus — to blame Washington squarely and likely destroy the broad coalition critical for sanctions enforcement that provided leverage for negotiating the accord in the first place. Alternatively, Trump could rigorously police implementation while pushing back firmly against Iran’s regional policies, which have helped further inflame Middle Eastern conflicts, frightened U.S. allies and angered the U.S. political establishment. But scrupulous enforcement cuts both ways: lacklustre U.S. implementation would adversely affect Iran’s ability to reap the benefits the U.S. has committed to deliver under the deal. The risk of an overly militarised response to Iran’s regional manoeuvres is that the JCPOA could become collateral damage in a destructive tit-for-tat. Trump could also try renegotiation to strengthen some of the deal’s nuclear provisions or add non-nuclear ones. But this, as viewed by many in his entourage, would require new non-nuclear sanctions to augment coercive pressure and/or a military threat to induce Iran to return to the table. Iran would almost certainly demand more relief for more concessions, not accept less for more. Iran has options for responding to attempts to undermine the deal. It could play victim, blame Washington and hope to erode sanctions by trying to drive a wedge between the U.S. and its partners. But this would require restraint in the face of U.S. JCPOA violations or provocations. Or it could ramp up its nuclear program and reduce IAEA access or target U.S. assets in theatres across Iraq and Syria, any of which risks a U.S. (or Israeli) military response. Even a softer, calibrated response would reignite the nuclear standoff and complicate future negotiations. All these scenarios are troubling. Yet, there is another way: a good-faith, consensual, mutually beneficial effort to renegotiate aspects of the accord might achieve a better-for-better arrangement and a more stable outcome. A Republican president backed by a Republican-controlled Congress would have more credibility in offering incentives to Iran than President Barack Obama ever did. Improving the JCPOA while enforcing it would require a quiet dialogue in which both sides recognised one another’s security concerns and core interests and communicated their nuclear and regional red lines. One outcome might be an addendum strengthening some JCPOA nuclear provisions or adding non-nuclear ones in return for rolling back the U.S. primary embargo. If that is not attainable, the U.S. might focus on non-Iran-specific arrangements, including regionalising or even universalising some of the JCPOA’s restrictions or transparency measures. On a practical level, Washington should keep communication channels with Tehran open and give its treasury department more resources to unwind sanctions. Iran should strictly adhere to the JCPOA and stop using nuclear or regional brinksmanship as leverage. Other P5+1 members should discourage it from over-reacting to a possible change in U.S. tone and approach but also clearly tell Washington that if it unjustifiably walks away from the accord, it will do so alone. Trump is the first U.S. president in more than two decades who enters office not needing to worry about Iran crossing the threshold to nuclear weaponisation undetected. If he tries to adjust the JCPOA unilaterally through coercion, the accord may not survive, reigniting the nuclear crisis and compounding regional instability. But he also has a chance to succeed on all fronts: a functioning and more stable accord, a framework for managing differences with Iran and perhaps even less bloodshed in the Middle East.

Why is it that the USA pretends to be afraid of Iranian nukes while Israel is encouraged to develop its nukes , not even sign the NPT, threaten its neighbors and be the ONLY nation in the region NOT supporting a nuclear-free zone there, which would solve all the worries except Israel’s dominance and domination of its neighbors.

"Here's What You Need To Know About What Trump Just Did To The Iran Nuclear Deal","U.S. President Donald Trump has, after months of threatening to do so, signed a memorandum instructing the U.S. government to begin pulling out of the controversial deal over Iran's nuclear programs. His administration has outlined a number of steps it plans to take in the next six months, but it is still not entirely clear when certain provisions will end and what impacts that may have in the near- and long-term with regards to Iran or other international engagements, such as America's ongoing negotiations with North Korea . Trump made the announcement from the White House on May 8, 2018. As a presidential candidate, president-elect, and then president, he has continually railed against the deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA , pledging to either negotiate a new one, or, failing to do that, withdraw from the agreement entirely. The biggest issue, as we at The War Zone have noted before , is that the JCPOA focuses on Iran's nuclear activities to the exclusion of everything else. Iran is, by the U.S. government's own admission, abiding by the letter of the deal. At the same time, however, the United States, as well as Israel, accuse Iranian authorities of violating the spirit of the agreement by not using relief from international sanctions and other tangible benefits to pursue stabilizing policies in the Middle East and elsewhere. Trump outlined this basic argument in his remarks on May 8, 2018: "In theory, the so-called 'Iran deal' was supposed to protect the  United States and our allies from the lunacy of an Iranian nuclear bomb, a weapon that will only endanger the survival of the Iranian regime.  In fact, the deal allowed Iran to continue enriching uranium and, over time, reach the brink of a nuclear breakout. The deal lifted crippling economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for very weak limits on the regime’s nuclear activity, and no limits at all on its other malign behavior, including its sinister activities in Syria, Yemen, and other places all around the world." Many have argued that the JCPOA is therefore inherently unworkable and that the U.S. government should discard it, which the Trump Administration has now chosen to do. At the same time, many criticisms of the deal are based on either honest or deliberate misunderstandings of its mechanisms, which appears to have informed Trump's final decision at least to some degree. So, here's a quick overview of what Trump said and did not say: Regardless, this is what his administration now plans to do: It is without a doubt worth considering whether Iran should be penalized for continuing the various aforementioned malign activities. It's also worth asking whether or not the Iran Deal, which was serving its stated purpose, was worth getting rid of entirely in pursuit of that goal. "The fact is they are going to want to make a new and lasting deal, one that benefits all of Iran and the Iranian people," Trump declared in his remarks, which you can watch in full below. "When they do, I am ready, willing, and able." However, the Iran deal is a multi-national affair and the other parties, Iran, Russia, China, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany have already made it clear they intend to continue within the JCPOA framework for the foreseeable future. The trilateral statement from the U.K., French, and German governments perhaps represent the greatest immediate challenge for the United States, given that Trump pointedly threatened anyone who continued to deal with Iran with additional sanctions. Russia and China have both reiterated their support for the deal, as well. The Israeli government, especially Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is a long time critic of the deal, has openly embraced Trump's decision. Iran already appears willing to try and use the Trump Administration's decision to drive a wedge between it and some of its oldest allies, saying that it will continue to work with the remaining parties to continue with the JCPOA. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani did say he was ordering the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran to begin preparations for restarting enrichment and processing work if the deal completely collapses. "This is a psychological war, we won’t allow Trump to win... I’m happy that the pesky being has left the Barjam," Rouhani said in his own statement after Trump's announcement, using the Farsi acronym for the JCPOA. "Tonight we witnessed a new historic experience... for 40 years we’ve said and repeated that Iran always abides by its commitments, and the US never complies, our 40-year history shows us Americans have been aggressive towards great people of Iran and our region." Trump's decision also comes literally right before newly appointed U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was set to meet with North Korean representatives in that country to iron out the final details about a historic meeting between the American president and premier Kim Jong Un at a still undisclosed location. A central goal of those discussions will be the elimination of North Korea's nuclear arsenal and ballistic missiles, which will already be a tall order . The United States has also been looking to immediately secure the release of three Americans that North Korea is holding hostage. It's not clear how the Trump Administration's decision vis-a-vis Iran might impact the geopolitical situation in the Middle East or elsewhere more broadly, but we might not have to wait long to see the second- and third-order effects.

"China is taking charge of a key element in Iran's nuclear deal","createPerformanceMark('first image displayed'); Iran's Ali Akbar Salehi speaks during a meeting in Beijing on Friday. Simon Song Iranian Vice-President Ali Akbar Salehi, who is also head of the country's Atomic Energy Organisation, on Friday said China would play "a leading role" in redesigning the Arak heavy-water reactor to significantly reduce its plutonium output. Selahi's comment, made as he wrapped up his meeting with Chinese nuclear experts and officials in Beijing, again highlighted China's role in the recent nuclear deal reached by Iran and the world powers, as well as the two countries' close cooperation in energy projects. As one of the key elements of the deal on Iran's nuclear programme with the P5+1 group - comprising China, Russia, the United States, Britain, France and Germany - Iran has agreed to redesign the Arak reactor, which is already in its final stage of construction, to reduce its annual plutonium production from 10kg to less than 1kg to "remove the concerns", according to Salehi. "China has accepted … a leading role in a working group that would look into the redesign and refurbishing of Arak. Americans will also participate very seriously," he said. Salehi held meetings with Foreign Minister Wang Yi and China Atomic Energy Authority chairman Xu Dazhe. Under the nuclear deal framework, a trilateral meeting between China, Iran and the US was expected to take place in mid-September on the sidelines of the International Atomic Energy Agency's general conference, despite internal political wrestling between the congress and the administration on the deal within the US , according to Salehi. In this photo released by the Iranian Presidency Office, President Hassan Rouhani, left, speaks as he is accompanied by the head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization Ali Akbar Salehi on a visit to the Bushehr nuclear power plant. AP Photo/Iranian Presidency Office, Mohammad Berno The Iranian vice-president said the country was also seeking Chinese assistance to build two small nuclear reactors with a capacity of 100 megawatts each. The two sides had discussed the issue "at length" and were expected to close deals "in the coming months", he said. China had "indicated readiness" to finance the projects, he added.

REUTERS/Brendan Smialowski/Pool Salehi said Iran would also look into the possibility of building larger nuclear power plants, with capacities of 1,000MW each, as the country aims to build 20,000MW of nuclear power capacity in 30 years. Iran has previously signed agreements with Russia to build two 1,000MW nuclear reactors. With economic sanctions on Iran lifted after the implementation of the nuclear deal, the multibillion-dollar trade relationship between China and Iran is set to expand. China is expected to invest more heavily in Iran's oil, gas and industrial sectors. Foreign Minister Wang was earlier quoted by state-run Xinhua as saying the deal "created more favourable conditions for the development of the China-Iran relationship".","https://www.businessinsider.com/chinas-role-in-iran-nuclear-deal-2015-8"
"Lessons Of A Collapsed North Korean Nuclear Deal","David Welna  Nearly a quarter-century ago, the U.S. signed an agreement aimed at stalling North Korea's drive for nuclear weapons. That deal collapsed eight years later. SCOTT SIMON, HOST: President Trump announced, of course, that June 12 summit with North Korea's back on and also blamed his predecessors. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: This should've been handled many years ago not only by President Obama but by other presidents. SIMON: The U.S. did strike a nuclear deal with North Korea under President Clinton. It held together for nearly eight years, then collapsed. And North Korea exploded its first nuclear bomb. NPR's David Welna revisits the deal known as the Agreed Framework. DAVID WELNA, BYLINE: In the early 1990s, North Korea appeared hellbent on going nuclear. It rejected proposed international inspections, announced it was pulling out of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and said it intended to produce weapons-grade plutonium. Then former President Jimmy Carter intervened. He went to Pyongyang, brandishing an olive branch. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JIMMY CARTER: The time has come to establish full friendship and understanding. WELNA: That helped lure North Korea, also known as the DPRK, into negotiations. In late 1994, a deal was struck that shut down its plutonium-producing reactor. The top U.S. negotiator was Robert Gallucci. He hailed the so-called Agreed Framework, at the time, as a breakthrough. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ROBERT GALLUCCI: Hundreds of nuclear weapons' worth of material would have been produced by these reactors. These reactors will be frozen now. WELNA: In return for shutting down those graphite reactors, the U.S. promised to supply North Korea with heavy fuel oil and two light water reactors. Joel Wit was the State Department's coordinator for implementing the deal. JOEL WIT: There were provisions to establish diplomatic relations. There were provisions to lift economic sanctions. There were provisions for security assurances. And so for them, all of that was a good deal. WELNA: But in 2002, a different administration did not see the deal good for the U.S. President George W. Bush declared North Korea part of an axis of evil. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GEORGE W. BUSH: North Korea has a regime arming with missiles and weapons of mass destruction while starving its citizens. WELNA: Later that year, the U.S. accused North Korea of secretly pursuing another path to nuclear weapons not through the prohibited plutonium process but by enriching uranium. Donald Rumsfeld, at the time, was defense secretary. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD RUMSFELD: It is a fact. It is a reality that they stand in direct breach of, I guess, four separate agreements. WELNA: The official then in charge of arms control at the State Department was John Bolton, who's now President Trump's national security adviser. Bolton would later write that North Korea's uranium enrichment was, quote, "the hammer I had been looking for to shatter the Agreed Framework." Nicholas Eberstadt, of the American Enterprise Institute, says he and Bolton often discussed that deal. NICHOLAS EBERSTADT: John Bolton's assessment was that the North Korean side was untrustworthy and was negotiating in bad faith. And I'd say that the record, since then, amply bears out misgiving. WELNA: Freed from inspections, North Korea tested its first nuclear weapon in 2006. Last month, a North Korean official declared, in her words, a feeling of repugnance towards John Bolton. But Joel Wit, who is now with the Stimson Center, says, in private, it was a different story. WIT: The North Koreans, who have a good sense of humor and wanted to sort of twist the knife a little bit into the Americans, would thank John Bolton for helping them build a nuclear weapons stockpile. WELNA: The lesson from all this, says Stanford University nuclear weapons expert Siegfried Hecker, is... SIEGFRIED HECKER: If you're going to pull out of a deal, you'd better be prepared for the consequences. WELNA: A lesson he also applies to the recent U.S. exit from the nuclear deal with Iran.

The weak explosions on May 24 at entrances to the Punggye-ri test site deep beneath Mount Mantap did not trigger the internal collapses that would put the site out of commission, a U.S. official told CNN , based on seismic data. No geology experts or arms inspectors – just a small delegation of foreign journalists – were allowed to monitor the showy detonations. North Korea removed technical equipment from the tunnel complex before they blew up the entrances, U.S. officials have also confirmed.

"Divided at the centre: Germany, Poland, and the troubles of the Trump era","Piotr Buras & Josef Janning  @JJ52  19th December, 2018  For most Europeans, it is now obvious that the foreign policy of US President Donald Trump threatens the global liberal order. Trump’s hostility towards multilateral arrangements and his unilateral “America First” policy directly oppose the European Union’s interests and principles in many areas – from the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal to free-trade agreements and the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty. His foreign policy has also sparked debate in Europe on the EU’s defence capabilities and role in the world, including on whether “European sovereignty” can offset the United States’ apparent abandonment of its traditional role as guarantor of the liberal order. Trump’s behaviour is also hitting Europe where it is most vulnerable – unity and cohesion between member states – at a delicate moment. As movements that attack the pro-EU mainstream are becoming increasingly popular in many European countries, Trump’s unilateralism and his emphasis on the nation state as the natural actor in international affairs are strengthening their nationalist narratives. Moreover, Trump’s attacks on Brussels align perfectly with the calls for emancipation from the EU’s supposed dictates from countries such as the United Kingdom, Poland, Hungary, and Greece. The US president’s power to deepen this divide in Europe – which is probably more severe than that created by the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq – should not be underestimated. Nowhere can this be seen more clearly than in the relationship between Germany and Poland. At stake is much more than bilateral relations between two neighbouring countries. In many ways, the Polish-German relationship forms the principal bridge between east and west, connecting two still rather different parts of the EU. Indeed, as the relationship is key to the future of the European project in many respects, the current crisis between Poland and Germany is a problem for the whole bloc. And Trump’s behaviour threatens any attempt to ease tensions between them. This paper analyses the Poland-Germany relationship in the context of their approaches to US foreign policy and, more broadly, their evolving perceptions of America as a global player and a partner of the EU. It pays particularly close attention to the ways in which Polish and German policies on the US have affected their EU defence ambitions and their attitudes towards multilateralism and Russia. Trump’s actions have brought about intense debates, new initiatives, and even important shifts in the foreign policies of Germany and Poland – which often have opposing priorities. While there remains a real possibility of a collapse in their relationship due to increasing mistrust, Berlin and Warsaw continue to have significant shared interests. Beginning in the mid-1990s, Germany was the most influential advocate of Polish accession to the EU and eastern enlargement more broadly. Poland’s interest in protecting its independence by joining the EU and NATO aligned with Germany’s desire to create a relationship with its eastern neighbours that was close as that with those to the west. Since 2004, when Poland and nine other eastern European states joined the EU, Polish-German relations have centred on Poland’s aim to create a “partnership for Europe” with Germany, as well as Berlin’s promise to treat Warsaw and Paris as equally important. [1] Yet, today, the relationship is widely viewed as being weaker than at any time since 1989 – so weak that it hampers efforts to re-energise the European project. This could be seen at the November 2018 celebrations marking the centenary of Polish independence, during which Polish President Andrzej Duda visited Berlin for a two-day conference on Germany’s policy on Poland since 1918. Meant as a symbol of re-engagement and goodwill, the trip ended in disaster. Duda perceived German journalists’ questions about the Polish approach to the rule of law as provocative, while his audience booed his criticism of the EU. Similarly, Poland’s ambassador to Berlin irked his hosts by describing the last 100 years of German policy on Poland as a “single catastrophe”. Made in the presence of German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas, this claim appeared to dismiss the three decades in which Berlin had pursued reconciliation with Warsaw and a constructive neighbourhood policy. Taken together, these two events form a microcosm of the crisis in Polish-German cooperation that began in 2015, when the right-wing, populist Law and Justice Party (PiS) came to power in Poland. In many ways, the crisis stems from the differing trajectories the sides have embarked on in their respective European policies. In his January 2016 speech on Polish foreign policy priorities, then foreign minister Witold Waszczykowski named the UK as Poland’s key diplomatic partner in Europe. In the preceding 25 years, his predecessors had named Germany in this role. While Warsaw’s rhetoric on Berlin has fluctuated during the last three years, mutual mistrust and major policy differences have continued to define their relationship, reflecting a deeper change in their perceptions of the EU. The PiS government has challenged the idea of closer EU cooperation, defended Polish national sovereignty against Brussels and Berlin, and rejected Germany’s role as the key power in the bloc. Disputes between the European Commission and the Polish government over the latter’s alleged violations of the rule of law, the Nord Stream 2 energy pipeline, and migration policy have overshadowed bilateral relations between Poland and Germany. As Warsaw criticised Berlin for its alleged dominance of the EU and demanded reparations for the second world war, German political elites complained about Poland’s refusal to cooperate on migration policy and its apparent lack of interest in improving the bilateral relationship. Germany’s recent leadership in managing European crises has triggered a domestic debate about how to readjust German foreign and security policy to better fulfil this role. For instance, Germany has been instrumental in forging EU unity on Russia sanctions policy, contributed greatly to strengthened NATO deployments in eastern Europe, and, most recently, advanced the debate on European sovereignty in response to dramatic shifts in US foreign policy. As German political scientist Gunther Hellmann put it , “ eine neuartige Erfahrung wird dabei sein, dass sich die Bundesrepublik nicht mehr automatisch auf die institutionellen Fixpunkte NATO und EU oder die Führungsleistungen zentraler Verbündeter wie die USA oder Frankreich verlassen kann, die der deutschen Außen- und Sicherheitspolitik in den vergangenen Jahrzehnten Orientierung und Entlastung lieferten ” (it will be a new experience for Germany to be unable to automatically rely on institutions such as NATO or the EU and the leadership of major allies such as the US or France, which in past decades have provided orientation and relief to German foreign and security policy). While they have yet to determine the direction and scope of the rhetorical and political changes this requires, political elites in Berlin are increasingly aware of the implications of their country’s pivotal position in the EU. Against this background, the 2018 edition of ECFR’s EU Coalition Explorer provides further evidence that the relationship between Poland and Germany has weakened in the last two years. Although the countries are in frequent contact with each other, most German respondents to the survey – comprising policymakers and policy analysts – view Poland and Germany as having few significant shared interests, and perceive Warsaw as relatively unresponsive to Berlin. Polish respondents still see Germany as being among their most important partners, albeit as less important than Hungary. However, German respondents view Poland as having disappointed their government during the last two years – and Polish respondents see Germany the same way. In the German view , Poland is as disappointing as Hungary and the UK. This slump in the Berlin-Warsaw relationship reflects, and is one of the most important causes of, a wider European malaise. Arguably, one cannot solve the problems of uncertain leadership in the EU and the growing east-west divide within the bloc without addressing the Polish-German crisis. Both individually and as partners, Germany and Poland are key to the future of European integration. Whether and how Germany could lead Europe – rather than act as the continent’s hegemon, as it is sometimes perceived – has become more pressing as the bloc stumbles from one crisis to the next. Berlin is likely to see itself as leading from the centre: acting as an honest broker for the various interests of EU member states rather than as an Ideengeber that provides clear guidance and seeks support for its own policy recommendations. It remains to be seen whether this form of leadership will suffice. Nonetheless, Germany can only lead effectively if it has the trust, support, and cooperation of other member states – not least Poland, as its second-largest neighbour, a key economic partner, and the biggest country in central and eastern Europe. Leading from the centre can hardly work if it is seen as merely a cover for Franco-German bilateralism. This is why Berlin perceives the effort to bring Poland back into the fold as crucial to the legitimacy and efficiency of its ideal of European leadership. As its stated goal is to maintain European unity, Germany cannot allow tensions between various parts of the bloc to create permanent political divisions. The country needs the cooperation of central and eastern Europe due to its close economic relationship with the region; its desire to find the right balance between protectionism and economic liberalism within the single market; and its aim to address security threats to Europe’s south and east. While Germany is crucial to maintaining unity within the EU, it is Poland’s political course that will largely determine whether the bloc will become increasingly divided. With Germany intent on preserving the status quo in European integration, the Polish government seems determined to roll back the supranational concept of EU founder Jean Monnet in favour of an intergovernmental construction – “l’Europe des patries” (a Europe of nations), in the words of another French EU founder, Charles de Gaulle. The fact that Polish and German policies are falling out of sync creates, therefore, a serious strategic challenge for not only Germany and Poland but the entire EU. Warsaw’s drift away from the European mainstream not only hampers Berlin’s aspirations to be an honest broker within a unified EU but also threatens the core Polish interest of maintaining a strong union. This is where the crisis of transatlantic relations – sparked by Trump’s behaviour – comes in. The Polish and German governments’ capacity to reconcile their policies on the US will have profound implications for the EU’s ability to pursue an effective independent foreign policy. Berlin and Warsaw have very different ideas about how to respond to the challenge Trump’s presidency poses to Europe. The prevailing German reaction has been to stress the need to defend the multilateral order and strengthen Europe’s resilience – for Maas, the answer to “America First” was to be “Europe United”. In contrast, the Polish response has been to remain calm and embrace the opportunities of the new political reality. Thus, while Germany emphasises European unity, Poland is investing in its bilateral partnership with the US. In some ways, these differences originate in the countries’ diverging analyses of what Trump’s presidency means for Europe and the transatlantic relationship. Interestingly, both the German and Polish narratives contain a large dose of fatalism. Germany’s new approach to America seems to be governed by what political scientist Thomas Kleine-Brockhoff calls “continuity theory”, or the “assumption that the changes in US foreign policy began well before Trump’s election – and will outlast his presidency well into the future”. If, having become overstretched in its global commitments, the US was always likely to dismantle the multilateral order and unilaterally pursue the American interest at any cost, Germany and the EU have to prepare for transatlantic tension (or even confrontation) that outlasts Trump’s radical presidency. Poland’s fatalism about America has an entirely different character. It is anchored in the notion that US security guarantees are indispensable in an increasingly dangerous geopolitical environment. Due to the lack of viable alternatives, Poland has no choice but to bet on continuous American security engagement with central and eastern Europe. To ease their doubts, Polish politicians seek America’s assurances – as seen in their quest to attract additional deployments of US combat forces on Polish soil. Since the stakes are so high, investment in the relationship with the US seems the only approach that can pay off. And, if it fails, the outcome will not be more disastrous than that of any other strategy. These differences may be unsurprising given Berlin’s and Warsaw’s diverging security perceptions, and the dissonance between traditional Polish Atlanticism and the long-standing anti-American sentiment sometimes found in Germany. A no less important factor is the roles the countries play in Trump’s vision of the world as a competition between great powers. He has singled out Germany as America’s main obstacle – even opponent – in Europe. Although his concerns about Germany’s large trade surplus and low defence expenditure are grounded in reality, Trump has criticised the country with an intensity that has chilled US-German relations for almost all his term. Within Trump’s narrative, a “very bad” Germany sharply contrasts with a reliable Poland, which meets NATO defence spending targets and is interested in an energy partnership with the US that would boost American liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports. Indeed, he has publicly courted the Polish authorities by visiting Warsaw in July 2017 and mentioning Poland as a key ally twice in his September 2018 speech before the UN General Assembly. Trump’s ideological similarities with the nationalist, populist Polish government and his differences with German Chancellor Angela Merkel – whom the international media has hailed as the last defender of the liberal order – are also crucial: while the Polish authorities saw Trump’s victory as continuing a political trend that began in Warsaw in 2015, the German political elite has publicly portrayed itself as fundamentally in conflict with the values and norms of the new America. Merkel’s remark that “the times in which we can completely rely on others are somewhat over” – made in Trudering in May 2017 – is perhaps the most famous expression of the transatlantic crisis. The fact that she is widely seen as a committed Transatlantikerin (her support for the Iraq war in 2003 put her at odds with then chancellor Gerhard Schröder and even public opinion) lends particular significance to her words. In a subsequent television interview, the chancellor said that Germany’s “second loyalty” (after loyalty to its people) should be to the EU – an important shift from the days in which she gave the EU and transatlantic relations equal weight. Merkel has not specified what Germany’s new strategy should look like, but she has conveyed German leaders’ overwhelming distrust and frustration with the Trump administration’s foreign policy. In Germany, Trump has become a symbol of a historic rupture with the US, heralding the end of the transatlantic era and of America’s role as the key guarantor of the multilateral liberal order and the only reliable pillar of European security. Indeed, as Maas wrote in August 2018, “the US and Europe have been drifting apart for years. There is less of an overlap in the values and interests that shaped our relationship for two generations.” Arguably, Trump’s behaviour has had a powerful impact on the Merkel government’s foreign policy, encouraging German leaders to echo French President Emmanuel Macron’s call for “European sovereignty”. Maas has set out to “reassess” Germany’s relationship with the US – and to create what he calls a “balanced partnership” in which Germany and Europe have an appropriate share of responsibility, and the EU can “form a counterweight when the US crosses red lines”. To this end, he has made substantive recommendations: establishing international payments and financial communications channels independent of the US; a European monetary fund; and a new alliance of multilateralists (comprising like-minded nations that oppose the US retreat from multilateral institutions). All in all, German leaders seek to address an “America First” foreign policy as a long-term challenge that requires Europe unity and resilience. Meanwhile, their Polish counterparts reject any narrative that focuses on America’s new unpredictability and desire for retrenchment. Warsaw largely views relations with Washington through the lens of security policy. Although the Polish public and government were unsettled by the possibility of American-Russian rapprochement at the beginning of Trump’s presidency, this has not come to pass. The Polish authorities have felt vindicated in their belief that Trump’s presidency would not – as leaders in Berlin worried – have negative consequences for Poland and Europe more broadly. Warsaw did not take Trump’s remark that “NATO is obsolete” entirely seriously, as the US remained committed to strengthening the Alliance’s eastern flank. Indeed, despite the disconcerting rhetoric, American contributions to Europe’s security have materially increased under Trump. And this is, as Polish diplomats and experts underline, a matter of hard facts rather than perceptions. Not only has Washington fulfilled the commitments it made at the 2014 NATO Summit in Wales; Trump has also declared that the US will increase the budget of the European Deterrence Initiative from $4.8bn in 2018 to $6.5bn in 2019. America is deploying another three brigades to Europe on a rotational basis, while pre-positioning additional ammunition and training equipment there. From the Polish government’s perspective, there is no reason to complain about US retrenchment. The American military presence, seen as the cornerstone of Poland’s security, includes a military hub in Powidz, a rotational heavy brigade in Zagan, the Redzikowo base of the European Phased Adaptive Approach anti-missile shield (designed to protect the entire alliance), and occasional aerial and naval patrols or naval patrols in the Baltic Sea. Furthermore, the 2018 US National Defense Strategy defines Russia as a “strategic adversary”, in line with threat perceptions in Warsaw. In fact, the Polish government is much more enthusiastic about the direction of Washington’s current policy than that under Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama, who attempted to “reset” American-Russian relations. Germany and France criticise American unilateralism for threatening the West’s unity, but Poland has other concerns. In Warsaw, political elites’ fear that America will betray Polish or European interests is weaker than their concern about the consequences of loosening transatlantic bonds. In other words, pushing European sovereignty as the medicine for the transatlantic crisis is seen as more dangerous than the disease it intends to cure. This scepticism about the direction of the western European debate about Trump and transatlantic relations only enhances Poland’s eagerness to strengthen its bilateral relationship with the US and position itself as Washington’s best ally in Europe. As such, Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Bartosz Cichocki has predicted that “in a few years’ time ... we can be in a completely different category of American allies” as “Poland is a kind of ‘substitute’ for the UK and Turkey in Europe.” This ambition has become the driving force of Poland’s foreign policy. It was on display during Duda’s visit to Washington in September 2018, where he signed a declaration on a US-Polish strategic partnership. Instead of pushing for the US to defend multilateralism, Warsaw has tended to cultivate the bilateral relationship and accept – willingly or otherwise – Trump’s new rules of the game. Polish Foreign Minister Jacek Czaputowicz acknowledged in a speech at the Stefan Batory Foundation in October 2018 that Trump has fundamentally changed the way that international politics works – and that Poland needs to adapt to this new reality. During his recent visit to Washington, Duda asserted that he pursues a “Poland First” policy. And, in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York, Duda did not echo his German counterpart’s call to defend multilateralism. Instead, he used the opportunity to criticise the current form of “multilateralism of usurpation and hierarchy”, contrasting this with “positive multilateralism of equal states and free nations” based upon the idea of “sovereign equality”. While Germany insists that the EU should establish strategic autonomy partly by taking foreign policy decisions through qualified majority voting, Warsaw perceives this as a threat to national sovereignty. The foreign policy tension between Warsaw and Berlin is most evident (and most problematic for Europe) in Trump’s rejection of the multilateral Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) on Iran’s nuclear programme. Germany has been at the forefront of EU efforts to establish a special purpose vehicle (SPV) designed to circumvent US sanctions on European companies that deal with Iran, while Polish diplomats regard any measures directed against the US as unacceptable. This may be at least partly because the SPV might also be used to circumvent potential US sanctions on European (particularly German) companies involved in the Nord Stream 2 energy pipeline project – which Poland has encouraged Washington to oppose. Therefore, on the JCPOA as other areas, the Trump administration’s foreign and security policy could have profound implications for EU cohesion. The American president’s criticism of low European (especially German) military expenditure and his ambiguous comments about NATO have lent new impetus to the debate on European defence. For France, the debate is about autonomy; for Germany, it is about responsibility. Meanwhile, Poland and several other countries have criticised the EU’s renewed interest in military cooperation for potentially undermining NATO. Arguably, it is inconceivable that Europeans would have engaged in so many political declarations and substantive projects – such as Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) and the European Intervention Initiative (E2I) – in their current form and scope without Trump’s interventions. In this way, security and defence policy has become an unexpectedly promising avenue for European integration. European countries now broadly accept the idea that they should do more on defence. However, the speed and form of this “more” are no less contentious than they were before Trump entered the White House. In fact, Trump’s behaviour has exacerbated the differences between some EU member states – not least Poland and Germany (as well as Poland and France). In a nutshell, the more Germany and France engaged in discussions about a “European army” or “common defence” as a response to what they perceive as the new transatlantic reality, the more Poland has emphasised the primacy of NATO and sought a closer relationship with America. Poland has long been concerned that the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) would weaken the transatlantic alliance by needlessly duplicating NATO structures and capabilities. One of the first decisions the PiS government made was to cancel its predecessor’s order of French Caracal helicopters, thereby damaging security cooperation with Paris and undermining Warsaw’s credibility within the EU. Poland only joined PESCO reluctantly and at the last minute (perhaps with the aim of watering down the project). And the country has traditionally preferred to work with US defence companies rather than their western European competitors – regardless of who occupied the White House. Poland’s long-standing concerns about the CSDP have grown due to its European partners’ response to the apparent shift in US policy on Europe under Trump. France’s dominant role in the response has played a particularly significant part in this. Macron pushed for greater European sovereignty in defence by advocating for an ambitious version of PESCO and launching the contentious E2I. Designed as an intergovernmental “coalition of the willing” outside the EU’s legal framework, the E2I came in response to France’s failure to found PESCO as an exclusive group of countries that had similar threat perceptions and were able to develop common defence capabilities. The version of PESCO the EU eventually adopted reflected Germany’s thinking more than that of France: while Paris was mainly interested in creating EU military capabilities and structures, Berlin focused on the political effects of the CSDP as a vehicle for EU integration. Berlin’s support for broad participation in PESCO – including countries as sceptical of the project as Poland – caused Paris to turn to other initiatives. Thus, while France may not have been entirely successful in pushing its defence agenda, it has undoubtedly driven efforts to respond to Trump’s challenge to Europe. For Poland and other countries in eastern Europe, the fact that the UK played no role in these defence cooperation plans and discussions was also important. As a pillar of the transatlantic relationship, the UK has long been a respected security partner in the region. In line with Warsaw’s identification of London as a key ally, the sides finalised a bilateral security partnership agreement in December 2017. The UK’s decision to leave the EU likely helped spur the deal, as it will leave the bloc with one less strong advocate for ensuring NATO remains Europe’s primary security provider. Meanwhile, Germany has limited its involvement in the debate on European defence cooperation due to the peculiarities of its approach to security policy. Supporting the establishment of a European army has long been part of the electoral platforms of both the Social Democrats and the Christian Democrats (as reflected in their current coalition agreement). However, this vision rarely guides policy planning. Mostly interested in the political dimension of the CSDP, Berlin has welcomed European defence cooperation as a form of integration that would strengthen the EU rather than as a tool to develop shared military capabilities. Equally, Germany lacks a strategic culture with clearly defined security goals and an understanding of the instruments needed to achieve them (France, in contrast, has always had a clear idea about the threats it wanted an upgraded CSDP to address). And the poor condition of the German armed forces – which German politician Hans-Peter Bartels has described as of ‘limited use’ – undermines Berlin’s credibility as a security policy actor. As a result of these factors, Germany has oscillated between passivity and control in the European defence cooperation debate. Although Merkel has used Macron’s language on defence issues – most strikingly, in repeating Macron’s call for a European army in November 2018 – Germany has always worked to prevent the establishment of an exclusive PESCO or any other EU defence project it perceives as too disconnected from the transatlantic relationship. Nonetheless, Berlin has had little active input in the policy debate – a fact that only strengthens Polish elites’ belief that the idea of ‘European defence’ is largely a French post-transatlanticist project. Therefore, Poland joined two PESCO projects in 2017 and six more a year later with the explicit goal of strengthening the European contribution to NATO and preventing the creation of autonomous European capabilities. Warsaw’s main concern about PESCO has been that joint EU capability planning would undermine collective territorial defence, as western European countries would be more interested in developing military capabilities designed for crisis management and foreign intervention (particularly in north Africa) rather than those for responding to Russian aggression. This gap between eastern and western European countries’ threat perceptions is key to the differences in their approaches to, and expectations of, PESCO – as seen in Poland’s suggestion that the project should even include non-EU members. As Minister of Defence Mateusz Blaszczak stated : “I mean here the US in the first place, but also Norway and the UK after Brexit.” Unsurprisingly, France did not invite Poland to join the E2I. In November 2018, Macron went a step further, arguing : “what I don’t want to see is European countries increasing the budget in defence in order to buy Americans’ and other arms or materials coming from your industry. I think if we increase our budget, it’s to have to build our autonomy and to become an actual sovereign power.” This definition of European sovereignty is anathema to Warsaw, especially at a time when it is negotiating a major deal to procure the US Patriot missile-defence system. Polish daily Rzeczpospolita  responded to the French president with a sentiment many Polish leaders share: “Macron’s activities are the reason why the future of NATO and the security of central eastern Europe are becoming even more dependent on the US”. Indeed, while French and German thinking about strategic autonomy is based on the assumption that the EU can no longer fully rely on the US, the shift in Poland’s security policy towards transatlanticist or even Polish-American solutions is increasingly apparent. Like Trump’s verbal attacks on Germany, disputes within NATO about defence spending and Europe’s responsibilities have made the Alliance seem vulnerable and prompted Warsaw to mediate its security relationship with Washington through bilateral channels. The PiS government celebrated Trump’s July 2017 visit to Poland for the Three Seas Initiative (TSI) Summit – during which the president delivered what his adviser Steve Bannon called his “most important foreign policy speech” – as its main foreign policy success, despite the fact that it had no tangible results. Nonetheless, Duda used his September 2018 visit to Washington to invite the US to set up a permanent American military base in Poland, colloquially known as “ Fort Trump ”, and offered to contribute $2bn to the initiative. In line with this, the replacement of rotating US military deployments on Polish soil (as agreed at the 2016 NATO Summit in Wales) with a permanent one has become one of the main declared goals of Polish security policy. Poland’s insistence on a permanent American presence stems from its interpretation of Russian strategic thinking. According to Polish experts, the Kremlin views rotational deployments as a limited commitment – in both scope and time. As such, a permanent presence serves as a more effective deterrent. Warsaw does not accept the argument often put forward by German politicians that deploying American or NATO forces at the Alliance’s eastern flank would violate the provisions of the 1997 NATO-Russia Founding Act. Yet, from Warsaw’s perspective, Russia has repeatedly voided the agreement by changing the security environment, not least with its invasion of Ukraine and militarisation of Kaliningrad. However, it is political rather than legal issues that make Fort Trump divisive within the EU and NATO. A bilateral deal on a permanent American military deployment in Poland would erode the carefully constructed consensus between the country’s NATO allies. To be sure, the Polish government has stressed that Fort Trump would be based on an arrangement that did not require their consent: Czaputowicz told NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg in October 2018 that they would merely “be informed” about the talks with the US, arguing that a permanent deployment would strengthen the Alliance as a whole. Germany disagrees (as does France). Aside from the fact that it could be militarily counterproductive , establishing a permanent American base on Polish soil outside the NATO framework would be politically costly for Poland. By betting on an unequal bilateral alliance and alienating Germany and France, Poland could quickly become a dependent client of America – under Trump or subsequent presidents. Warsaw can be useful to the Trump administration in reducing the EU’s cohesion, thereby preventing unified European opposition to Washington on issues such as the INF Treaty and the JCPOA. In this way, concessions the US might extract from Poland in talks on Fort Trump could affect how the EU approaches these areas. Polish excitement about Fort Trump may well turn out to be premature even if, as expected, the US boosts its military deployments to Poland without establishing a permanent presence there. Trump seems reluctant to send more troops abroad without having a good cause for doing so – not least because of his campaign promises on this. He seems likely to portray Poland’s request as evidence of the success of his tough approach to NATO and European defence spending. The prospect of a permanent base may end up as a bargaining chip in NATO’s internal debates – or even in US-Russian discussions. Trump’s announcement in October 2018 that the US would withdraw from the INF Treaty could set Poland and Germany on opposite sides of a crucial European security debate. Signed in 1987 by US President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, the treaty prohibits America and Russia from developing and deploying land-based missiles with a range of 500-5,500km. As it bans the weapons the countries could use to fight a “limited” nuclear war in Europe, the agreement is widely perceived as a cornerstone of European security. Trump’s announcement, therefore, partially decoupled European and American security interests, with potentially catastrophic consequences. Freed from the limits of the INF Treaty, Moscow could openly deploy intermediate-range land-based missiles capable of hitting targets across Europe from within mainland Russia, prompting a US response and increasing the likelihood of a new nuclear arms race beyond the US and Russia. The US government has publicly accused Russia of spurning the treaty, partly by testing a cruise missile that exceeds INF limits, since 2014. However, there has been only a muted reaction from European countries as many of them have no way of independently verifying American intelligence on the missile – the SSC-8, a successor of the SS-20, which became the focal point of nuclear competition between the Soviet Union and the West in the 1970s and the 1980s. While Warsaw has voiced its concerns about the issue, Berlin initially described the evidence on the tests from American intelligence as “not unambiguous”. The German government then went further, responding to a parliamentary question from Die Linke’s Kleine Anfrage with the claim that the development of the SSC-8 did violate the INF Treaty. The silence of European leaders such as Merkel and Macron on the issue and Russia’s broader military build-up has long disappointed Warsaw. Trump’s announcement about the INF Treaty has met with criticism in Germany. But there is no German public debate on the threat Iskanders deployed to Kaliningrad or other Russian missiles could pose to German cities. This is partly because Berlin believes there is little chance that Moscow will launch an attack and partly because German political discourse on nuclear weapons is still heavily influenced by the Nachrüstungsdebatte (rearmament debate) that took place in West Germany in the 1980s. In that era, the West German government led by Chancellor Helmut Schmidt demanded that NATO respond to the deployment of the SS-20. With the US seemingly reluctant to react, Schmidt feared that the American nuclear guarantee to Europe would not hold without the deployment of a Western system that would deter the Soviets from using the new missile. The Alliance’s double-track decision in 1979 – which combined an offer of talks to the Soviet Union with the deployment of US Pershing II missiles in Germany – led to the collapse of Schmidt’s coalition government two years later. (His party, the Social Democrats, refused to support the deployment after it provoked the largest demonstrations in West German history and generated widespread public hostility to the US). Ever since, support for nuclear and other forms of arms control and disarmament has been one of the key features of Germany’s security policy and political culture. Against this background, the German public misread the discussions between Reagan and Gorbachev in Reykjavik in 1986, which eventually led to the INF Treaty, as a triumph of reason over the madness of nuclear arms races. In fact, the deal was a return to the status quo ante in nuclear deterrence. Thus, Maas responded to Trump’s declaration about the INF by claiming that Germany “would fight with all available diplomatic means to defend the treaty”. Former Social Democrat leaders published a joint letter in which they warned against a new arms race and called upon Europe and Germany to be the voice of “disarmament and common security”. “Russia and the United States accuse each other of violating the INF”, they wrote , envisaging Europe as a neutral intermediary between the powers. Meanwhile, the Greens reiterated their stance that the US should withdraw the 350 or so nuclear missiles it has stationed in Germany. Poland’s foreign ministry was far more conciliatory, stating that it agreed with the American assessment that Russia had violated the INF Treaty and, as a consequence, understood Trump’s move. (Minister Czaputowicz added that US withdrawal from the INF would not threaten Poland’s security because no new American intermediate-range missile would be used against Poland.) However, it is not Berlin’s and Warsaw’s differing views of the US decision and Russia’s alleged treaty violations that threaten to become the main point of contention, either bilaterally or within NATO and the EU. The most divisive issue is likely to be the effect of US withdrawal from the INF Treaty on Europe’s security environment. The American decision needs to be seen in its wider strategic context. China – whose tactical nuclear weapons threaten US allies in the Pacific while America’s hands are bound by INF Treaty restrictions – is likely to be the real target of Trump’s decision. Nonetheless, the US has for some time considered a change in its nuclear strategy to address Russia’s military build-up. Indeed, the country’s February 2018 Nuclear Posture Review advocates strengthening American nuclear tactical capabilities through the deployment of sea-based missiles (which the INF Treaty does not cover). Yet, even before Trump became president, the US had mulled responding to Russia’s INF violations with the development and deployment of new land-based intermediate-range missiles. Following his announcement about the INF Treaty, it seems that the US will choose the latter option to redress the nuclear imbalance in Europe. This debate could deepen the mistrust and misunderstanding between Poland and Germany, preventing the EU and NATO from formulating a common response to the challenges of a future arms race. In fact, from Warsaw’s perspective, a new arms race has already started – with the West remaining passive as the threat from Russia grows. Poland is particularly concerned about Russia’s military build-up in Kaliningrad and what it sees as the “nuclearisation” of Russian military doctrine. Unlike Germany, Poland has no aversion to nuclear weapons and still sees itself as a second-tier NATO member because it does not host permanent deployments of American missiles or troops. Warsaw rejects German criticism of efforts to strengthen NATO in ways that could violate the 1997 NATO-Russia Founding Act, not least because Germany hosts large numbers of US troops and equipment. For the Polish government, this allows Germany to feel safe in a manner that Poland cannot. However, the gap between Polish and German threat perceptions is even more fundamental than this. Warsaw sees its principal goal of further strengthening the NATO and US military presence on its soil as the only logical response to the current military imbalance between NATO and Russia, and the lasting military imbalance between Poland and Russia. In contrast, Berlin believes that increasing the American military presence in Poland would threaten the country – by prompting further Russian escalation. Breaching the NATO-Russia Founding Act would, so the German argument goes, cause Moscow to retaliate by amassing even more troops in Kaliningrad and, possibly, Belarus. This would make Poland (and Europe) less secure. The announced American withdrawal from the INF Treaty makes a collision between these differing philosophies more likely. Because they believe an arms race is already under way, some PiS leaders claim that Trump’s decision could even provide an opportunity to restore the strategic balance, with Poland playing a key role in this by hosting “rapid reaction forces on its territory in [Fort Trump] as well as missile forces to deter Russia”. Trump’s behaviour has also driven a wedge between Poland and Germany on energy policy. To be sure, the countries’ conflicting views on cooperation with Russia and the importance of renewables have often put them at loggerheads with each other bilaterally and in the EU. This tension has considerably intensified in the last two years – and not only because of Trump. The key problem has been Nord Stream 2, which provoked heated arguments and legal disputes as it entered its final stage. However, Trump supercharged this controversy with an unprecedented (business-orientated) intervention on the topic, as well as his broader attitude towards Germany. Energy has played an important role in the debate about the trade imbalance between the US and Europe. Trump’s strategy for reducing America’s trade deficit has been not only to impose tariffs and other restrictions on imports but also to increase American exports in lucrative sectors such as LNG. Thus, boosting European imports of American LNG has become a priority of his European policy – one that fits neatly with his depiction of Germany as America’s key adversary in Europe, not at least due to its huge trade surplus. Berlin supports Nord Stream 2, as it would make Germany the hub of central European gas supply lines. But the project would also cause EU member states, especially those in central and eastern Europe, to be more dependent on Russian gas imports. Geopolitics aside, Trump believes that it is not in America’s economic interest for Europe to establish a closer energy partnership with Russia or for Germany to strengthen its economic position in central and eastern Europe. And Nord Stream 2, which is scheduled to become fully operational by the end of 2019, has remained a divisive issue within the EU. While some, especially Germany and Austria, openly support the project, others – mostly Poland and Baltic states, but also the European Commission – oppose it. Moreover, the development of LNG infrastructure (with terminals in Swinoujscie and Krk) is a priority of the TSI – a project involving countries on the Baltic, Adriatic, and Black seas that Germany has long viewed as an attempt to build an alliance within the EU, thereby weakening the bloc. Trump, who has never concealed his contempt for European integration, likely sees playing on these divisions as a means of enhancing US influence in Europe. Warsaw doubtlessly hopes that American criticism of Nord Stream 2 will be decisive in the long dispute over the project. Supported by nine other EU member states, Poland has long opposed Nord Stream 2 for: weakening Ukraine, which currently exacts transit fees on Russian gas exports to Europe; working against the EU’s goal of diversifying its energy supplies away from Russia; and violating the Third Energy Package, which requires “unbundling”, or dividing energy extraction and distribution between different companies. However, these complaints have not had the desired result. Berlin remains unimpressed with Warsaw’s arguments about the security risks of Nord Stream 2, though some influential voices in the German debate support this point of view. Most importantly, an attempt to use legal arguments to prevent the pipeline from being built, or at least render the project financially unsustainable, has failed too. In September 2017, the EU Council’s legal service rejected (on Germany’s insistence, according to Der Spiegel ) the European Commission’s request to allow it to negotiate a special arrangement with Russia on behalf of EU member states. The Commission also proposed an amendment to the Third Energy Package that would have required Nord Stream 2 to fully comply with the EU legislation, substantially increasing costs for the pipeline consortium. In March 2018, the EU Council’s legal service also rejected this initiative, dealing a powerful blow to Warsaw’s hopes. (Under proposed changes to the gas directive, all import pipelines would have to not be owned directly by gas suppliers, and would have to maintain non-discriminatory tariffs, transparent operations, and 10 percent capacity for third parties.) Having lost the battle within the EU, US interest in EU pipeline politics provides Warsaw with one last chance to derail the project. It became clear that Warsaw might be able to count on US support in January 2018, when Rex Tillerson, then US secretary of state, visited Poland. Tillerson said that Nord Stream 2 is “undermining Europe’s overall energy stability and security” and that the US would “continue to take steps [to prevent it] as we can”. In an interview published shortly afterwards, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki urged the US administration to impose sanctions on the companies involved in the project. The issue of possible American punishment hit the headlines after Trump lashed out at Germany ahead of the NATO Summit in July 2018, calling Berlin “captive of Russia” and “totally controlled by Russia” while criticising the planned pipeline as “very inappropriate”. While Merkel emphasised that Berlin would make “autonomous decisions” on energy supply and German business representatives claimed that Trump’s threats “encroach on European energy policy”, Poland pinned its hopes on American determination to cancel Nord Stream 2. Indeed, during a visit to Warsaw in November 2018, US Energy Secretary Rick Perry confirmed that the US could still impose sanctions on companies involved in the project. The dispute over potential US sanctions has driven a wedge between Poland and Germany, deepening mistrust between them more than any other issue. For Poland, sanctions provide its last chance to achieve a strategic goal; for Germany, the US threat of such measures is unacceptable interference in the EU’s internal affairs and German economic interests. Berlin also sees Warsaw’s drive for sanctions as completely unacceptable. As German diplomat Wolfgang Ischinger argued , Trump’s behaviour is pushing Germany “towards Russia and China”. Poland’s strategic interest in energy cooperation with the US extends beyond Nord Stream 2. Warsaw rejected the new pipeline for not only geopolitical but also economic reasons – with American LNG imports playing an important role in its energy security calculations. Poland intends to allow its contract with Gazprom to expire in 2022, making it fully independent of Russian energy imports. The country will replace around 10 billion cubic metres of Russian gas per year with Norwegian gas imported through the planned Baltic Pipe, as well as LNG from various – ideally, American – companies. Swinoujscie’s LNG terminal has the capacity of 6bcm and is already operational. According to some Polish government sources, LNG imports and the Baltic Pipe could also help Poland become a gas hub in central and eastern Europe. The relatively high prices of LNG and Norwegian gas could prevent this from happening, as could a lack of interest in buying “Polish” gas in the region. However, long-term contracts with Gazprom linked to Nord Stream 2 would undoubtedly destroy any hope of achieving this goal. [2] Therefore, Trump’s interest in promoting American LNG exports aligns with Polish strategic aims, creating common ground for an energy partnership. In November 2018, Polish state-owned energy giant PGNiG signed a 24-year LNG import contract with US firm Cheniere – under which, from 2023, Poland will buy 2bcm of LNG per year from the Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi terminals, in the Gulf of Mexico. The previous month, Poland signed a contract with US firm Venture Global LNG for 2bcm of LNG per year from 2022. The country is also negotiating two other contracts. While the exact price of the gas is not publicly known, PGNiG claims that it is 20-30 percent lower than that of Russian gas. As part of the TSI, the energy partnership with America largely aligns with infrastructure projects between northern and southern European countries. Although Poland aims to become a hub for distributing gas across the region through the TSI, this would require further integration and an estimated €615bn in transportation infrastructure investment before 2025. Berlin worries that, in addition to weakening the unity of the EU, the TSI will undermine Germany’s political relationship with central and eastern Europe. This runs counter to Berlin’s strategic aim of remaining anchored in Europe’s east and west. While the Polish government has stressed the purely infrastructural character of the project, many PiS politicians and advisers have described the TSI as a plan B for Europe, should the EU collapse. To strengthen its position as a regional leader and counterbalance Germany and France, Poland has encouraged the US to endorse the TSI and invest in the project. Trump’s July 2017 visit to Warsaw to attend the TSI Summit appeared to signal that the initiative has American support. So did his energy secretary’s visit to the TSI Summit in Bucharest in September 2018. However, the US has not announced any major investments in the TSI aside from those linked to LNG cooperation. As a result, its advocates hope that the EU will back projects in the framework of the TSI. Both European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and the Maas attended the Bucharest summit as observers. While Germany has shifted towards supporting the TSI (to avoid being left out), Poland would still prefer to work with the US on the project. Trump’s behaviour has undoubtedly driven Berlin and Warsaw further apart on a range of issues. Weakening the consensus between European countries and undermining the EU appears to be the deliberate policy of the current US administration. Yet divisions between Berlin and Warsaw over transatlantic issues have at least as much to do with their long-held views of US policy, the EU, and NATO. Another principal obstacle is the pervasive mistrust between the German and Polish governments, which shapes their perceptions of each other. To put it bluntly, Germany sees the current Polish government as undermining the cohesion of Europe and ignoring the normative and legal obligations of EU membership. For Berlin, Warsaw seeks to roll back political integration while retaining all the benefits of membership, not least financial support. In contrast, Poland sees Germany as claiming a hegemonic role in Europe, using its control over institutions in Brussels to force its preferences on others. Given these irreconcilable positions, Polish-German disputes over how to respond to changes in transatlantic relations should come as no surprise. Both sides should work to narrow the gap between them. German leaders have no interest in ending their partnership with Poland, as this would have far-reaching implications for Germany’s role in its eastern neighbourhood. Determined to contain centrifugal forces within the EU, Berlin aims to promote the benefits of shared sovereignty. Equally, Polish leaders have no interest in alienating their country’s most important economic partner. A cooperative Germany is Poland’s bridge to the west; a distant Germany could be a barricade. Both need each other, albeit for somewhat different reasons – Poland’s dependence on Germany is mostly economic, while Germany’s dependence on Poland is mostly political. Nonetheless, current trends suggest that the bilateral relationship will deteriorate further. Avoiding this outcome will require a new strategy and significant political will. The latter is in short supply, especially in Poland. But Germany and Poland can reconcile at least some of their interests – to the benefit of both them and the wider EU. Initially, this effort should involve the following steps: Relations between Germany and Poland are too important to their broader interests – and to the cohesion of the EU – to be allowed to deteriorate further. Berlin and Warsaw both aim to shape the EU’s policies and institutions, even if they have profoundly different goals and strategies. Failure to address their differences and to overcome obstacles to cooperation would hamper both on the European stage – albeit in an asymmetric way, given the disparities between them in size, strength, and influence. As the fabric of EU cooperation is made up of strong bilateral relationships, neither Warsaw nor Berlin can afford to waste the potential of a once-productive partnership.

"The Real Achievement of the Iran Nuclear Deal","Right now, a thousand pundits and politicians are debating the details of Thursday’s framework nuclear deal with Iran. That’s fine. I think the details are far, far better than the alternative—which was a collapse of the diplomatic process, a collapse of international sanctions as Russia and China went back to business as usual with Tehran, and a collapse of the world’s ability to send inspectors into Iran. But ultimately, the details aren’t what matters. What matters is the potential end of America’s 36-year-long cold war with Iran. For the United States, ending that cold war could bring three enormous benefits. First, it could reduce American dependence on Saudi Arabia. Before the fall of the shah in 1979, the United States had good relations with both Tehran and Riyadh, which meant America wasn’t overly reliant on either. Since the Islamic Revolution, however, Saudi Arabia has been America’s primary oil-producing ally in the Persian Gulf. After 9/11, when 19 hijackers—15 of them Saudis—destroyed the Twin Towers, many Americans realized the perils of so great a dependence on a country that was exporting so much pathology. One of the unstated goals of the Iraq War was to give the United States a large, stable, oil-producing ally as a hedge against the uncertain future of the House of Saud. What George W. Bush failed to achieve militarily, Barack Obama may now be achieving diplomatically. In recent weeks, American hawks have cited Saudi anxiety about a potential Iran deal as reason to be wary of one. But a big part of the reason the Saudis are worried is because they know that as U.S.-Iranian relations improve, their influence over the United States will diminish. That doesn’t mean the U.S.-Saudi alliance will disintegrate. Even if it frays somewhat, the United States still needs Saudi oil and Saudi Arabia still needs American protection. But the United States may soon have a better relationship with both Tehran and Riyadh than either has with the other, which was exactly what Richard Nixon orchestrated in the three-way dynamic between Washington, Moscow, and Beijing in the 1970s. And today, as then, that increases America’s leverage over both countries. Over the long term, Iran may also prove a more reliable U.S. ally than Saudi Arabia. Iranians are better educated and more pro-American than their neighbors across the Persian Gulf, and unlike Saudi Arabia, Iran has some history of democracy. One of the biggest problems with America’s Mideast policy in recent years has been that, from Saudi Arabia to Pakistan to Egypt, the governments the United States supports preside over populations that hate the U.S. Thursday’s nuclear deal, by contrast, may pave the way for a positive relationship with the Iranian state that is actually undergirded by a positive relationship with the Iranian people. Which brings us to the second benefit of ending America’s cold war with Iran: It could empower the Iranian people vis-à-vis their repressive state. American hawks, addled by the mythology they have created around Ronald Reagan, seem to think that the more hostile America’s relationship with Iran’s regime becomes, the better the United States can promote Iranian democracy. But the truth is closer to the reverse. The best thing Reagan ever did for the people of Eastern Europe and the U.S.S.R. was to embrace Mikhail Gorbachev. In 1987, American hawks bitterly attacked Reagan for signing the INF agreement , the most sweeping arms-reduction treaty of the Cold War. But the tougher it became for Soviet hardliners to portray the United States as menacing, the tougher it became for them to justify their repression at home. And the easier it became for Gorbachev to pursue the policies of glasnost and perestroika that ultimately led to the liberation of Eastern Europe and the disintegration of the U.S.S.R. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, like Gorbachev, wants to end his country’s cold war with the United States because it is destroying his country’s economy. And like Gorbachev, he is battling elites who depend on that cold war for their political power and economic privilege. As Columbia University Iran expert Gary Sick recently noted , Iran’s hardline Revolutionary Guards “thrive on hostile relations with the U.S., and benefit hugely from sanctions, which allow them to control smuggling.” But “if the sanctions are lifted, foreign companies come back in, [and] the natural entrepreneurialism of Iranians is unleashed.” Thus “if you want regime change in Iran, meaning changing the way the regime operates, this kind of agreement is the best way to achieve that goal.” The best evidence of Sick’s thesis is the euphoric way ordinary Iranians have reacted to Thursday’s agreement. They’re not cheering because they want Iran to have 6,000 centrifuges instead of 20,000. They’re cheering because they know that opening Iran to the world empowers them, both economically and politically, at their oppressors’ expense. Finally, ending the cold war with Iran may make it easier to end the civil wars plaguing the Middle East. Cold wars are rarely “cold” in the sense that no one gets killed. They are usually proxy wars in which powerful countries get local clients to do the killing for them. America’s cold war with the U.S.S.R. ravaged countries like Angola and El Salvador. And today, America’s cold war with Iran is ravaging Syria and Yemen. When America’s relationship with the Soviet Union thawed, civil wars across the world petered out because local combatants found their superpower patrons unwilling to send arms and write checks. The dynamic in the Middle East is different because today’s cold war isn’t only between Iran and the United States, it’s also between Iran and Sunni Arab powers like Saudi Arabia and Egypt, neither of which seems particularly interested in winding down the civil wars in Syria and Yemen. Still, a different relationship between the United States and Iran offers a glimmer of hope. In Syria, for instance, one reason Iran has staunchly backed Bashar al-Assad is because it fears the fierce hostility of his successors. The United States cannot entirely alleviate that fear, since some of the groups battling Assad—ISIS, most obviously—are fiercely hostile to Iran and to Shiites in general. But if Iran’s leaders knew that at least the United States would try to ensure that a post-Assad government maintained good relations with Tehran, they might be somewhat more open to negotiating a transfer of power in Syria. Clearly, the United States should push for the best nuclear deal with Iran that it possibly can. But it’s now obvious, almost three decades after Reagan signed the INF deal with Gorbachev, that it’s not the technical details that mattered. What mattered was the end of a cold war that had cemented Soviet tyranny and ravaged large chunks of the world. Barack Obama has now begun the process of ending America’s smaller, but still terrible, cold war with Iran. In so doing, he has improved America’s strategic position, brightened the prospects for Iranian freedom and Middle Eastern peace, and brought himself closer to being the kind of transformational, Reaganesque president he always hoped to be.

"Europe Should Strike Tough Pose with Trump on Iran Nuclear Deal","France, the United Kingdom, and Germany (the ‘E3’) appear set to intensify ongoing talks with the US in an effort to convince Donald Trump to stick to the Iran nuclear deal. Trump has threatened to withdraw from the agreement in May unless certain preconditions were met. Europeans hope the ongoing discussions will be able to find a middle way to both safeguard the nuclear deal and address outstanding areas of concern with Iran, such as on missiles and regional issues. However, Trump’s recent nomination of Mike Pompeo as US secretary of state increases the risk that this approach will backfire on Europe. European policymakers largely viewed Rex Tillerson as a voice of moderation within the White House and as someone who, together with secretary of defense James Mattis, influenced Trump towards a more pragmatic position on Iran. If Europe is serious about saving the nuclear deal, then the appointment of Pompeo, an Iran-hawk in Washington , should serve as an urgent prompt to rethink its current strategy. Some in European policy circles hoped that Trump’s statement on the nuclear deal on 12 January this year was part of his maximalist negotiating tactics, and that if Europe showed some flexibility, the president would be climb down from these demands. But one of the reasons Trump cited when firing Tillerson was their disagreement over the Iran nuclear deal. This should indicate that the moderate voices in the White House have been unable to bridge gaps between Trump and Europe over the nuclear deal. Trump, meanwhile, remarked on the “ very similar thought process ” he and Pompeo share on a number of issues. Pompeo has been especially outspoken on Iran: he opposed the nuclear deal, supported regime change, and downplayed the costs of war with Iran. With Pompeo now in charge of US diplomacy, Europeans are likely to face a tougher and non-accommodating negotiating posture from the Trump administration over the nuclear deal. This comes against a backdrop of rising regional tensions between Iran and Israel , in addition to repeated pledges from Trump to confront Iran, most recently in his Nowruz message marking the Iranian new year. Trump’s deal-making during his term in office should create doubt as to whether he would actually implement a side framework agreement of the type that his administration is currently seeking to strike with Europe over Iran policy. On foreign policy matters, Trump has remained dangerously unpredictable, and threatened everything from trade war to nuclear war. The pattern of negotiations between his administration and the US Congress over immigration and healthcare suggests that, even if Trump’s counterparts make concessions to fulfill his demands, there is no guarantee that he will, in the end, accept it. Europeans should therefore be clear-eyed about the chances of success of current talks with the United States. Based on recent precedent, Trump is likely to perceive Europe’s flexibility and accommodation over Iran policy as a weakness that he can exploit to raise the benchmarks of demands. Moreover, by threatening imminent withdrawal from the nuclear deal, Trump is increasingly pressuring the E3 to jump on board with his efforts to undermine the agreement. Republican lawmakers such as Senator Bob Corker have also adopted this stance and warned that, unless the E3 sign up to the side framework agreement that meets US demands, Trump is unlikely to extend sanctions waivers due in May. Yet, in their attempt to save the nuclear agreement through reaching a broader understanding with the Trump administration on Iran policy, the E3 must ensure that Europe does not become complicit in hollowing out the nuclear agreement. So far, the International Atomic Energy Agency has repeatedly verified that Iran is fulfilling its nuclear-related obligations. However, Iran has firmly indicated it will take reciprocal action to match any US backtracking from the deal. A potential side agreement between the E3 and the US with respect to the nuclear deal therefore risks a tit-for-tat exchange between Tehran and Washington that could alter and muddy their respective commitments under the agreement and cumulatively cause it to unravel. In light of Pompeo’s appointment, the E3 should harden their negotiating tactics on the nuclear deal in ways that match the mindset of the Trump administration. First, Europeans should take a unified and more assertive position in forthcoming talks with the US to underscore that they will not be party to, nor accept as permissible, violations of a multilateral and United Nations Security Council-enshrined agreement. The E3 should continue to outline that it will not, and indeed cannot, alter expiration dates of the terms in the nuclear deal (so-called “sunset provisions”) as Trump has demanded. If Trump wants to kill the deal, he must take full responsibility, and Europe should avoid guilt by association. Second, Europe should continue to show openness to working with the US administration on a follow-up to the nuclear agreement with Iran once the current deal has reached a more mature stage of implementation. The E3 should also have a candid exchange with Iran on regional security and demonstrate to the Trump administration that a range of tools exists to address concerns related to Iran. But in return for this flexibility, Europeans should outline an expectation that Washington will adhere to its existing obligations under the multilateral agreement and minimize the unpredictability surrounding Trump’s waivers of sanctions. The sequencing of European measures and flexibility will be important to strengthening the E3’s position. For example, the European Union should first receive firm assurances that Trump will waive nuclear-related sanctions in May before it even debates the tougher measures against Iran’s missiles programme proposed by the US and reportedly supported by the E3 during a meeting with EU foreign ministers on Monday this week. The E3 should also consider how political and legislative measures within the US could better guarantee US commitments to the nuclear deal. This could entail extensions in the length of time between each waiver of US secondary sanctions related to Iran’s nuclear programme (thereby easing the unpredictability surrounding Trump’s actions), and pressing for progress in the Airbus aviation deals with Iran explicitly permitted under the nuclear deal. Third, Europeans should prepare for the worst-case scenario – namely, a US withdrawal from the agreement and snap-back sanctions in May – and minimise the damage that will ensue. Pompeo’s appointment should be a trigger for European policymakers and companies to step up contingency planning to salvage the deal even without the US. For Iran to continue implementing the restrictions on its nuclear programme, there must be a degree of political and economic incentives. As outlined elsewhere , Europe could provide this package to Iran by using a range of political and technical tools that ring-fence companies from the enforcement of US secondary sanctions through legal carve-outs, sector-specific exemptions, political understandings, and reviving the EU Blocking Regulation. In current talks with the US, Europe should privately stress its willingness to pursue alternative options to preserve the nuclear agreement. A significant benefit of outlining a contingency plan at this stage is the deterrence impact it may have on Trump’s decision to kill the deal through highlighting the isolation the US would face. In short, Europe should outline, as it has done on the issue of trade and the Paris climate accord, that it will work with like-minded coalitions to fill the gaps left by US withdrawal. This strategy may not, in the end, alter the decision by Trump to execute his campaign promise to “dismantle” the “disastrous deal” with Iran. But this approach at least provides Europe with the political capital to try to salvage the agreement and thereby secure its own non-proliferation goals. If Iran’s nuclear program expands in respond to Trump’s withdrawal, other regional powers, such as Saudi Arabia, have warned that they will do the same. A firm European position in defense of the diplomatic accord may also reduce the growing risk of confrontation between Washington and Tehran in the Middle East, for which Europe will inevitably bear the cost. This approach also sets a precedent that Europe is a credible international partner, demonstrating political willingness to safeguard international norms at a time when global leadership is lacking. Ellie Geranmayeh is a policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations based in London since October 2013. She focuses on European foreign policy in relation to Iran on the nuclear talks and wider regional issues. It is good to see that the European Council on Foreign Relations is issuing this advice and guidance to European governments. Let’s hope they listen. ‘First, Europeans should take a unified and more assertive position in forthcoming talks with the US to underscore that they will not be party to, nor accept as permissible, violations of a multilateral and United Nations Security Council-enshrined agreement.’  Yes, and that position should be “You go your way, and we’ll go our way,” as with the Paris Climate Agreement. And, the European assertion should be – perhaps behind closed doors – that they will continue to meet their obligations under UNSC RES/2231 (2015), and if secondary sanctions are applied against European companies, retaliatory measures will be seriously considered. ‘You play hardball, we’ll play hardball’ – that’s the message needed in a ballgame with Trump, Pompeo and Bolton. Thanks Ms Geranmayeh. A very good read and I hope EU does play “hard ball” with the Trump adm in its upcoming negotiation! Interesting post , although it is reasonable , and even much more than that , to become skeptical concerning the prospect of that JCPOA agreement , one may also observe it bit differently : Trump indeed declared that that deal is disastrous . Yet , his stance , is not really understood in concrete terms , I mean , what is so wrong with it ?? The atomic energy agency , has declared over and over , that the Iranians are fully complying with it . The more reasonable assumption is that , Trump wants , or wanted  to take out the Iranians , whatsoever so , notwithstanding any deal ( and see all those declarations concerning the regime change in Iran ) . On the other hand , he has declared recently , that if it would be fixed indeed , then , possible modification in his opposition can become reality , and so , the deal would be kept . So , one needs to ask the simple question , how to reconcile : Certain ” fixation ” and no more than that , with those  notions of : the utmost disastrous deal of Obama , or changing at first place the regime in Iran . There is a chance however , that : Having understood ( after being elected ) how complicated and disastrous it can be , to withdraw from that deal , he looks for a ” ladder ” for descending back to reality . As such , the Europeans , can offer that ladder by : Suggesting , that Iran , in no way , would no more , and never transfer ballistic missiles and such knowledge related to Lebanon and Yemen ( as clearly condemned by Trump and Nick the ambassador to the UN , and in connection with the JCPOA indeed ) . So , the Iranians would maintain the deal , gain lifting of sanctions , and also , we shall avoid so an imminent war in Lebanon .By that , we can have a chance of : all around deal . everybody wins , no one loses in fact . Bit more than slim chance , but the only reasonable one , right now it seems . P.S : Maybe his recent hawkish appointments ,support in fact such stance . Old trick of Old dogs : you secure your right political flank , so , if you would move to the left , you would have a hawkish back up. Thanks The United States of America does not need Europe. Europe is a basketcase. You have native populations so pessimistic about the future that they arent even reproducing. You have an invasion of Muslims into the continent under the watch of a nutty German woman, and they are actually reproducing. Imagine that. You have a European central bank who is still AFTER 10 YEARS maintaining 0% interest rates and running a low growth moribund economy in a world where everybody else is increasing interest rates to normal levels and is seeing sustained highef GDP growth.  All of the major industries of this century sit in America from Google to Amazon to Uber to Tesla etc. And the US now has ultra low corporate taxes as well. In other words, you are dying we are not. Iran will NEVER get a nuclear weapon and certainly not as stipulated in the failed Iran deal. You can agree or not agree but Israel and the US will take out any capabilities they acquire with military strikes. I think Trump benefits by being unpredictable. Iran is forced to meet the JCPOA requirements while the US can make sure that Iran gets no new business deals/benefits. Given this, I don’t see any difference whether he stays in the agreement or opts out. The European fools are running around thinking they can satisfy Trump. My impression is that come May 12 he will find an excuse to superficially stay in the deal with another 3 month deadline. This is a game where Iran will have to make the next move.

"Trump Should Do His Nuke Deal Homework","Shadow Government:  Trump Should Do His Nuke Deal Homework  Trump Should Do His Nuke Deal Hom...  There are many reasons to doubt that the expected summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un will result in a breakthrough, given Pyongyang’s history of duplicitous negotiations and decades-long pursuit of nuclear weapons. But Trump is right to pursue the summit, both to reduce the risk of military conflict and to see if there is a realistic chance that diplomacy can resolve the North Korean nuclear crisis. Trump is confident in his negotiating skills and likely thinks that he is better positioned to close a deal than decades of prior negotiators were. To maximize the chances for breakthrough, however, Trump and his incoming national security advisor, John Bolton, should study a set of negotiations that they both frequently deride: those between President Barack Obama’s administration and Iran. Despite Trump’s criticism of the Iran nuclear deal, or Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), it offers lessons for the president as he prepares to talk with Pyongyang. First, comparing the JCPOA and past U.S. negotiations with North Korea, such as the 1994 Agreed Framework , suggests that Trump should assess the possibility for a big deal that results in a comprehensive agreement between Washington and Pyongyang, rather than a small deal in which North Korea would make limited nuclear concessions in exchange for limited benefits from the international community. The Agreed Framework, in which North Korea agreed to freeze the development of two nuclear reactors in exchange for fuel oil, represented small diplomacy. The framework ultimately failed because North Korea continued a covert nuclear program, prompting President George W. Bush’s administration to withdraw. In negotiating the JCPOA, the Obama administration drew two lessons from this failure: First, the United States and allies should seek a deal that would comprehensively address Iranian nuclear issues, rather than agree to an incremental approach that would leave Iran with ample opportunities to cheat. Second, the United States should front-load a deal so that Iran would have to move quickly to meet extensive nuclear commitments, such as removing centrifuges and dismantling its Arak reactor. This structure was intended to prevent Iran from getting what it wanted — sanctions relief — in exchange for only partly meeting its commitments. To date, the Iran deal has worked as intended: Iran implemented extensive nuclear commitments in the first six months after the accord was announced, and JCPOA critics generally concede that the provisions in force during the deal’s initial years severely constrain Iranian nuclear activity. Trump should seek a similarly comprehensive agreement that requires North Korea to implement a wide-ranging set of nuclear steps before the United States and its allies implement significant economic concessions. Indeed, if the JCPOA collapses in the coming months, it will be because critics of the deal, including Trump, see it as too small. The JCPOA allows Iran to begin expanding its nuclear enrichment program in the early 2020s and does not address Iran’s support for terrorism and other malign activities across the Middle East. From an Iranian perspective, the JCPOA has failed to deliver promised economic relief, due in part to the fact that the United States kept in place tough sanctions on Iran’s support for terrorism, ballistic missiles program, and regional malfeasances. This has enabled critics in both Washington and Tehran to argue that the deal fails to adequately protect their national interests. With North Korea, Trump should use the summit to assess the possibility of a genuinely big deal that would comprehensively address numerous North Korean threats to the United States and its allies. But to begin a serious discussion about potential parameters of a big deal, Trump needs to enter the summit with an understanding of the issues on which he is prepared to negotiate. In public and private statements, the Trump administration has been clear that it will insist on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. However, the Trump White House has taken few public positions on other issues, such as formally ending the Korean War, the U.S. force posture on the peninsula, or security guarantees that Beijing (and Washington) might provide Pyongyang, suggesting that Trump may be open to negotiations on wide-ranging issues other than the core U.S. objective of denuclearization. Kim will undoubtedly come to the table expecting to discuss these issues, and Trump needs to know before he and Kim meet which of them the United States is prepared to negotiate over and which it is not. On sanctions, the lesson from the JCPOA is that Trump will need a clear vision of what sanctions the United States would be prepared to lift as part of a nuclear deal with North Korea and which the United States would insist on keeping in place even after a deal is in effect. North Korea will insist on lifting recent rounds of U.N. sanctions as a central part of any deal. But the Trump administration needs to decide if it would also be willing to ease U.S. bilateral sanctions as part of a deal, such the U.S. trade embargo, or whether the United States would keep such sanctions in force to ensure ongoing pressure on North Korea for its human rights abuses and other non-nuclear issues. More generally, Trump and U.S. allies will need to decide what, if any, sanctions are non-nuclear in nature and so should be excluded from any deal. Trump and Bolton should also understand that negotiations with Pyongyang are not just about the United States and North Korea — they are about China, much as Iran’s negotiations were in part about Iran’s role in the Middle East. While the JCPOA did not include sanctions relief on Iran’s support for Hezbollah or against the country’s destabilizing regional activities, Iran wanted the deal in part to end its isolation and legitimize its regional role. Similarly, Pyongyang sees negotiations with the United States as a way to enhance its regional statute and recalibrate its relationship with Beijing, which has grown increasingly tense and is likely to remain so, despite Kim’s recent summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping. North Korea’s interest in being less dependent on China may make Kim more eager to strike a deal. Conversely, Beijing is concerned about maintaining a seat at the negotiating table and could try to spoil negotiations if it thinks a U.S.-North Korea deal includes terms contrary to China’s interests. Finally, the JCPOA negotiations show the importance of setting a specific timetable for concluding negotiations and of keeping pressure up while negotiations are under way. When the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council — Britain, China, France, Russia, and the United States — plus Germany, announced an interim nuclear deal with Iran in late 2013, negotiators gave themselves six months to conclude a comprehensive agreement. They ultimately extended that deadline in several stages, but the existence of the self-imposed timetable ensured that all parties stayed focused on reaching an agreement, rather than playing for time. A fixed schedule for any negotiations with Pyongyang following the Trump-Kim summit will be even more important given North Korea’s long history of using negotiations as a stalling tactic to buy time to make nuclear progress. Meanwhile, keeping sanctions in place increases U.S. leverage with each passing day, given that sanctions only really began to bite last year and that their economic impact on Pyongyang is still building. There are many reasons to doubt that the United States will reach a diplomatic breakthrough with North Korea. Pyongyang has a long history of duplicity in negotiations and has elevated nuclear weapons as a core symbol of the Kim family’s power and legitimacy. Weeks after photos from Trump’s summit with Kim dominate global headlines, talks may well collapse as it becomes clear North Korea is not prepared to end its nuclear program. But by studying the lessons of the JCPOA, Trump can increase the odds of using the summit to determine if there is even a glimmer of hope for a peaceful resolution to today’s greatest nuclear threat.

"'No One Will Trust' U.S. if Trump Ends Nuclear Deal, Iran's President Says","President Hassan Rouhani of Iran said Tuesday that if President Donald Trump backs out of the 2015 nuclear deal, "no one will trust America again" and his country could then resume work on expanding its nuclear capabilities. Rouhani raised that possibility in an interview with NBC News just before Trump spoke for the first time as president before the United Nations General Assembly, where he called Tehran a "murderous regime" and the nuclear deal "an embarrassment to the United States." Under the framework agreement between Iran and six world powers — the U.S., the U.K., France, China, Germany and Russia — Tehran agreed to curb its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of some economic sanctions. Trump and his top diplomats have threatened to withdraw from the deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, saying Iran has violated it in spirit, if not in letter. "The exiting of the United States from such an agreement would carry a high cost, meaning that subsequent to such an action by the United States of America, no one will trust America again," Rouhani told Nightly News anchor Lester Holt in a one-on-one interview airing Tuesday. He added: "Every word was analyzed many times by countries involved before its ratification, so if the United States were to not adhere to the commitments and trample upon this agreement, this will mean that it will carry with it the lack of subsequent trust from countries towards the United States because the greatest capital that any country has is trust and credibility." The Trump administration recently imposed new economic sanctions on Iran, citing its development of ballistic missiles and the launching of a satellite-carrying rocket into space . And while Trump has reluctantly certified to Congress that Tehran is in compliance with the agreement ─ a stance that six fellow signatories share ─ he may take a more aggressive approach when the deal comes up for renewal in October. Trump is also reportedly weighing new measures against Iran's proxy forces in Iraq and Syria, and its support for militant groups elsewhere. Asked if Iran would continue to abide by the deal if the United State withdrew, Rouhani said his country's commitments "would no longer exist" and it would be free to pursue a new path. "One of the options and choices were one of our counterparts not to remain in the current framework would be to go back to previous activities," Rouhani said. "This is one option. And that's not difficult. We can easily go back to previous conditions if counterparts were to not live up to their commitments. But you do know fairly well that Iran will not be the initiator of this return to that path." But he stressed that Iran would resume "peace activities only," saying the country had no intention of leaving the agreement. "So we will never go towards production of nuclear weapons, just as in the past we never intended to go towards that path nor did we ever. It has always been peaceful." Rouhani defended Iran's use of ballistic missiles, saying that it fell outside the nuclear agreement and that his country would never sacrifice its "defensive missile capabilities." He also complained that the Trump administration was lumping Iran in with North Korea by describing both countries as nuclear threats. "We wish to have nuclear energy for peaceful uses just as today, in Arak, there is collaboration between America, China and Iran for the completion of the power plant in Arak," Rouhani said of the industrial city where his country has been modifying a reactor pursuant to the nuclear agreement. Rouhani also addressed Iran's detention of a father and son, Baquer and Siamak Namazi , who have joint American and Iranian citizenship and were convicted of "collaborating with an enemy state." The Iranian president said Tehran does not recognize dual citizenship, and so the courts see the Namazis as Iranians only. And he said the government's separation of powers prevented him from influencing a decision by the judiciary. © 2019 NBC UNIVERSAL","https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/iran-nuclear-talks/no-one-will-trust-u-s-if-trump-ends-nuclear-n802611"
"Obama Yields, Allowing Congress Say on Iran Nuclear Deal","Advertisement Supported by By  Jonathan Weisman and Peter Baker WASHINGTON — The White House relented on Tuesday and said President Obama would sign a compromise bill giving Congress a voice on the proposed nuclear accord with Iran as the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, in rare unanimous agreement, moved the legislation to the full Senate for a vote. An unusual alliance of Republican opponents of the nuclear deal and some of Mr. Obama’s strongest Democratic supporters demanded a congressional role as international negotiators work to turn this month’s nuclear framework into a final deal by June 30. White House officials insisted they extracted crucial last-minute concessions. Republicans — and many Democrats — said the president simply got overrun. “We’re involved here. We have to be involved here,” said Senator Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland, the committee’s ranking Democrat, who served as a bridge between the White House and Republicans as they negotiated changes in the days before the committee’s vote on Tuesday. “Only Congress can change or permanently modify the sanctions regime.” The essence of the legislation is that Congress will have a chance to vote on whatever deal emerges with Iran — if one is reached by June 30 — but in a way that would be extremely difficult for Mr. Obama to lose, allowing Secretary of State John Kerry to tell his Iranian counterpart that the risk that an agreement would be upended on Capitol Hill is limited. As Congress considers any accord on a very short timetable, it would essentially be able to vote on an eventual end to sanctions, and then later take up the issue depending on whether Iran has met its own obligations. But if it rejected the agreement, Mr. Obama could veto that legislation — and it would take only 34 senators to sustain the veto, meaning that Mr. Obama could lose upward of a dozen Democratic senators and still prevail. The bill would require that the administration send the text of a final accord, along with classified material, to Congress as soon as it is completed. It also halts any lifting of sanctions pending a 30-day congressional review, and culminates in a possible vote to allow or forbid the lifting of congressionally imposed sanctions in exchange for the dismantling of much of Iran’s nuclear infrastructure. It passed 19 to 0. Why Mr. Obama gave in after fierce opposition was the last real dispute of what became a rout. Josh Earnest, the White House spokesman, said Mr. Obama was not “particularly thrilled” with the bill, but had decided that a new proposal put together by the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee made enough changes to make it acceptable. “We’ve gone from a piece of legislation that the president would veto to a piece of legislation that’s undergone substantial revision such that it’s now in the form of a compromise that the president would be willing to sign,” Mr. Earnest said. “That would certainly be an improvement.” Senator Bob Corker , Republican of Tennessee and the committee’s chairman, had a far different interpretation. As late as 11:30 a.m., in a classified briefing at the Capitol, Mr. Kerry was urging senators to oppose the bill. The “change occurred when they saw how many senators were going to vote for this, and only when that occurred,” Mr. Corker said. Mr. Cardin said that the “fundamental provisions” of the legislation had not changed. But the compromise between him and Mr. Corker did shorten a review period of a final Iran nuclear deal and soften language that would make the lifting of sanctions dependent on Iran’s ending support for terrorism. The agreement almost certainly means Congress will muscle its way into nuclear negotiations that Mr. Obama sees as a legacy-defining foreign policy achievement. The Senate is expected to vote on the legislation this month, and House Republican leaders have promised to pass it shortly after. “Congress absolutely should have the opportunity to review this deal,” the House speaker, John A. Boehner of Ohio, said Tuesday. “We shouldn’t just count on the administration, who appears to want a deal at any cost.” White House officials blitzed Congress in the days after the framework of a nuclear deal was announced, making 130 phone calls to lawmakers, but quickly came to the conclusion that the legislation could not be blocked altogether. Moreover, officials increasingly worried that an unresolved fight could torpedo the next phase of negotiations with Iran. “Having this lingering uncertainty about whether we could deliver on our side of the deal was probably a deal killer,” said a senior administration official, who asked for anonymity to describe internal deliberations. Under the compromise legislation, a 60-day review period of a final nuclear agreement in the original bill was in effect cut in half, to 30 days, starting with its submission to Congress. But tacked on to that review period potentially would be the maximum 12 days the president would have to decide whether to accept or veto a resolution of disapproval, should Congress take that vote. The formal review period would also include a maximum of 10 days Congress would have to override the veto. For Republicans, that would mean the president could not lift sanctions for a maximum of 52 days after submitting a final accord to Congress, along with all classified material. American and Iranian officials are using different words to describe elements of the preliminary agreement to limit Iran’s nuclear program. And if a final accord is not submitted to Congress by July 9, the review period will snap back to 60 days. That would prevent the administration from intentionally delaying the submission of the accord to the Capitol. Congress could not reopen the mechanics of a deal, and taking no action would be the equivalent of allowing it to move forward. Mr. Corker also agreed to a significant change on the terrorism language. Initially, the bill said the president had to certify every 90 days that Iran no longer was supporting terrorism against Americans. If he could not, economic sanctions would be reimposed. Under the agreement, the president would still have to send periodic reports to Congress on Iran’s activities regarding ballistic missiles and terrorism, but those reports could not trigger another round of sanctions. The measure still faces hurdles. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, fresh off the opening of his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, dropped plans to push for an amendment to make any Iran deal dependent on the Islamic Republic’s recognition of the State of Israel, a diplomatic nonstarter. But he hinted that he could try on the Senate floor. “Not getting anything done plays right into the hands of the administration,” Mr. Rubio said. Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, abandoned an amendment to make any Iran accord into a formal international treaty needing two-thirds of the Senate for its ratification, but he, too, said it could be revived before the full Senate. Mr. Earnest said the president also wanted no more changes. “We’re asking for a commitment that people will pursue the process that’s contemplated in this bill,” he said. Democrats had implored Mr. Obama to embrace the legislation. “If the administration can’t persuade 34 senators of whatever party that this agreement is worth proceeding with, then it’s really a bad agreement,” Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, a Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, said. “That’s the threshold.” To temper opposition to the deal, Mr. Kerry, Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew and Energy Secretary Ernest J. Moniz gathered with senators Tuesday morning in a classified briefing, after a similar briefing on Monday for the House. But the administration met firm opposition in both parties. The agreement “puts Iran, the world’s worst state sponsor of terrorism, on the path to a nuclear weapon,” said Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, as he emerged from the briefing. “Whether that’s a matter of months or a matter of years, that’s a dangerous outcome not just to United States and allies like Israel but to the entire world.” An earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of the Secretary of Energy. He is Ernest Moniz, not Earnest. David E.

"","Last month marked the 35th anniversary of the deadliest attack against US forces since World War II: the bombing of the US Marine barracks in Beirut on October 23, 1983 that killed over three hundred people, including 241 US military personnel. The official US line now is that elements of what would later become Hezbollah, backed by Syria and Iran, were responsible for the attack—although all three parties continue to deny involvement. During an event marking the anniversary, US President Donald Trump, with his customary love of theatrical moments, signed new legislation targeting Hezbollah. The first response from Lebanon was defiant. For a long time the United States has pitted itself against Iran and, by extension, Hezbollah. Since the Islamic Revolution at the end of the 1970s in Iran and, later, Hezbollah’s inception during the Lebanese Civil War, the Americans have hunted the two in a remarkably consistent way. This has not changed under President Trump; American strategy, however, has shifted. It has been influenced by a fundamental repositioning of US policy vis-a-vis the entire world—a mindset most commonly referred to as “America First.” The Trump administration has been more aggressive in removing itself from or renegotiating existing treaties, and seems content with exercising a much more risk-friendly foreign policy. To understand how this new policy of Trumpism has affected Hezbollah, Lebanon, or Iran, looking at the realities on the ground is somewhat pointless. To understand these changes, one should instead examine Trump’s version of reality. This is not a new phenomena when regarding the foreign policy of America, but under Trump it has become particularly acute. The Trump paradigm, which is not an openly declared policy, is that the US will do what it likes and what suits it, with little regard to how it impacts other nations—allies included. This has had huge global implications. How many treaties has Trump made redundant, or at least announced his intention to scrap? In less than two years Trump has, for example, exited a landmark international climate change agreement, unilaterally walked away from the Iran nuclear deal, and, most recently, indicated he would junk an arms control agreement with Russia. Every foreign policy decision under Trump’s direction is a wild card. Trump’s targeting of Hezbollah comes as part of a shift in America’s Middle East strategy to more closely reflect the policy goals of Israel and, to a lesser extent, Saudi Arabia—both hellbent on countering Iranian influence across the region. So far, Trump’s administration has sought to counter the group by targeting its financiers. This is not a radical departure from the previous administration, but it seems that Obama during his second term was less interested in pursuing Hezbollah and more amenable to working with the group’s patron, Iran. In 2008, at the outset of the Obama administration, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) launched a law enforcement campaign, code-named Project Cassandra, to disrupt Hezbollah’s alleged global drug trafficking and money laundering network. Following its investigation into Hezbollah’s sources of funding, the DEA alleged that the group reaped $1 billion per year laundering money from drug proceeds. Near the end of Obama’s first term, drawing on evidence from the DEA investigation, the US Treasury blacklisted local financial institution the Lebanese Canadian Bank (LCB). According to the original indictment issued in the Southern District of New York US Federal District Court, LCB was involved in a tri-continental money laundering operation that stretched from South America to North America and West Africa. A money exchange entity in a West African country that was a subsidiary of LCB was accused of channeling the proceeds, but the money came mostly from manipulation of the used car market, including pre-owned vehicle dealerships in the US, with smaller amounts coming from Latin America. Allegedly, LCB was also involved in the financing of Hezbollah activity, but the actual affiliation of LCB was never visible, above the level of individual branch managers having some connections to the group. There was never a smoking gun linking bank executives to Hezbollah, and, in 2013, LCB’s board and all shareholders agreed to a settlement of over $100 million on the condition of no admission of guilt. That year, discussions began in earnest between the Obama administration and its counterparts on the UN Security Council, plus Germany and the EU, that ultimately led to negotiations on an Iran nuclear deal framework. In pursuit of a drawdown of Iran’s nuclear weapons capability, the Obama administration began quietly withdrawing support for Project Cassandra, a Politico investigation published last December reported. The Politico investigation concluded that the Obama administration sidelined the operation because it feared DEA investigations and Treasury actions would jeopardize negotiations with Iran. It was only 15 months ago, in August 2017, that Lebanon’s prime minister, Saad Hariri, stood on the White House lawn as Trump declared a forthcoming answer to the “menace” of Hezbollah. At the time, we did not know what Trump had in store. In May, Trump withdrew the United States from the Iran nuclear deal, in part on the implied notion that Iran was using the country’s economic recovery from sanctions relief to fund Hezbollah. The Americans see Iran’s support for Hezbollah as a destabilizing force, in both a political and security sense, away from the interests of the US and its allies in the region. The Iranians see Hezbollah as a useful tool extending Persian political influence and its interpretation of Shiite Islam, Waliyat al-faqih, serving as a resistance and counter to Israel and, in recent years, securing mutual interests in Syria. In August, the US reapplied a first phase of sanctions, and in early November reimposed a second phase of sanctions targeting key Iranian trading and energy activities, namely the nation’s petroleum exports. The US is targeting Iran’s economy to alter its political influence and military behavior in the region, and to temper Iranian financial support to Hezbollah. Back in 2015, after the Iran deal was concluded, Congress passed a law—the “Hizballah International Financing Prevention Act” (HIFPA)—meant to kneecap the group financially and isolate it from the banking system worldwide. The legislation may have been driven more by America’s political environment rather than regulatory need, Executive reported in 2016, placating conservatives and war hawks in the Congress enraged by the agreement with Iran. It is, however, unclear what practical effect that law had in cutting Hezbollah off from the international financial system. HIFPA required the Obama administration to report to Congress on Hezbollah’s alleged narcotics trafficking and alleged transnational criminal activities, but if that was done the reports were never made public.

"Trump slaps Europe in the face with Iran deal pull-out","By Georgi Gotev | EURACTIV.com with AFP  German Chancellor Angela Merkel (L) talks to French President Emmanuel Macron (R) and US President Donald J. Trump (C) at the beginning of the plenary session of the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany, 7 July 2017. [Felipe Trueba/EPA/EFE] Comments  Print    In the aftermath of Donald Trump’s announcement to withdraw from a landmark deal curbing Iran’s nuclear programme, the leaders of Britain, France and Germany who signed the agreement published a joint statement saying they will continue to stick by it. President Donald Trump pulled out from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPoA), the official name of the 2015 deal curbing Iran’s nuclear on Tuesday (8 May), defying European pleas and prompting international outcry. Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iran deal drew comparisons with his move last June to pull out from the Paris climate agreement. Similarly, the European reaction to continue with the Paris deal bears resemblance with the vow to forge ahead with the Iran deal. European leaders reacted with anger and defiance after President Donald Trump yesterday (1 June) announced the United States, the world’s second biggest carbon emitter, was quitting the 2015 Paris Agreement. The big difference however is that this time the US prepares to slam heavy sanctions on its allies who are doing business in Iran. Another aspect is the toxic effect of this announcement for the Middle East, the EU’s backyard. Trump's decision to withdraw from #IranDeal is his biggest slap in the face to date to US allies. More significant than TPP withdrawal, Paris withdrawal, Jerusalem decision, or “trade war”. We stand united on our commitments Go ahead @FedericaMog  @eu_eeas ! pic.twitter.com/wEAFrfXA0K — EESC President (@EESC_President) May 8, 2018 Trump poured scorn on the “disastrous” accord, describing it as an “embarrassment” to the United States that does nothing to contain Iran’s nuclear ambitions. The Iran Deal is defective at its core. If we do nothing, we know what will happen. In just a short time, the world’s leading state sponsor of terror will be on the cusp of acquiring the world’s most dangerous weapons…. pic.twitter.com/58qwBLzxIH — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 8, 2018 “I am announcing today that the United States will withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal,” Trump said in an address to the nation from the White House. Statement on the Iran Nuclear Deal: https://t.co/O3SpryCKkc — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 8, 2018 Slapping aside more than a decade and a half of careful diplomacy by Britain, China, France, Germany, Iran, Russia and past US administrations, Trump called for a “new and lasting deal.” That grand bargain, he said, would have to include not just deeper restrictions on Iran’s nuclear programme, but on its ballistic missiles and support for militant groups across the Middle East. “We cannot prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb under the decaying and rotten structure of the current agreement,” he claimed. “We will not allow American cities to be threatened with destruction and we will not allow a regime that chants ‘Death to America’ to gain access to the most deadly weapons on Earth.” It remains far from clear if the international community, or Iran, will play along. Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani — whose standing at home now risks being undermined by the deal’s collapse — was furious, accusing Trump of “psychological warfare”. Trump’s onerous demands and his warning that Iranians deserve better than their current “dictatorship” will only heighten suspicions his ultimate goal is regime change. “If the regime continues its nuclear aspirations, it will have bigger problems than it has ever had before,” he warned. Hawkish US officials believe that after 38 years in power, Iran’s clerical regime is substantially weakened by domestic economic pressure, changing demography, public demonstrations, and costly foreign military adventures. The decision marked a stark diplomatic defeat for Europe, whose leaders, repeatedly and in person, begged the mercurial US leader to think again. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Wednesday (2 May) that the nuclear deal with Iran should not be cancelled but its negotiating framework needed to be broadened. In a joint statement, Germany’s Angela Merkel, Britain’s Theresa May and France’s Emmanuel Macron voiced their “regret and concern” at Trump’s decision.

The nuclear non-proliferation regime is at stake. — Emmanuel Macron (@EmmanuelMacron) May 8, 2018 European firms doing business in Iran now have a six month deadline to wind up investments, or risk US sanctions, Trump’s hawkish advisor John Bolton warned, while ruling out talk of reconsideration. “We’re out of the deal. We’re out of the deal. We’re out of the deal,” he said. EU foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini said in a statement that the nuclear deal “is not a bilateral agreement and it is not in the hands of any single country to terminate it unilaterally”. ?Remarks by @FedericaMog on the statement by US President Trump regarding the Iran nuclear deal #JCPOA  #IranDeal ? https://t.co/wZ9orJKXOY — European External Action Service – EEAS ?? (@eu_eeas) May 8, 2018 She said she was “particularly worried” by the announced new sanctions. “I will consult with all our partners in the coming hours and days to assess their implications. The European Union is determined to act in accordance with its security interests and to protect its economic investments.” Washington’s new ambassador to Berlin, Richard Grenell, said on Twitter: “US sanctions will target critical sectors of Iran’s economy. German companies doing business in Iran should wind down operations immediately.” As @realDonaldTrump said, US sanctions will target critical sectors of Iran’s economy. German companies doing business in Iran should wind down operations immediately. — Richard Grenell (@RichardGrenell) May 8, 2018 And Treasury Secretary Stephen Mnuchin made it clear that Washington was acting “under both our primary and secondary sanctions authorities,” meaning that European firms with investments or operations in the United States could be targeted if they continue to trade with Iran. In a sign of the depth of European displeasure, plans are already being drawn up in Brussels to introduce measures blocking US sanctions, an extremely rare move against an allied government. While Iran’s arch foes in Israel and Saudi Arabia welcomed Trump’s decision, signatories to the existing deal vowed to plow ahead without the United States. Trump’s decision offers him a domestic political victory, fulfilling a longstanding campaign promise and underscoring his no nonsense political brand. But the long term impact for American foreign policy and for the Middle East was less clear. Former US president Barack Obama — whose administration inked the deal — made a rare public criticism of his successor, describing Trump’s decision to abandon the Iran nuclear deal as “misguided” and a “serious mistake.” “The consistent flouting of agreements that our country is a party to risks eroding America’s credibility, and puts us at odds with the world’s major powers.” In contrast, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who last week released a trove of intelligence on a pre-2003 Iranian plan to develop a nuclear weapon which Trump cited approvingly in his speech, was overjoyed. “Israel fully supports President Trump’s bold decision today to reject the disastrous nuclear deal,” Netanyahu said, in a televised address. Shortly after, Syrian state media reported nine pro-government fighters were killed in an Israeli missile strike near Damascus, where Iranian proxies are known to operate. Israel had already opened bomb shelters and put the military on high alert in case of attack from the Iranian forces deployed in Syria in defence of Bashar al-Assad’s regime. Energy industry insiders say Trump’s tough stance on Iran will probably keep oil prices higher than they would otherwise be. The European Commission was unable yesterday to answer questions how would higher oil prices impact on the European economies. . @realDonaldTrump 's verdict on #Iran deal will be not only his most important decision on diplomatic front-the economic impact may be huge too. In Spain, if oil prices reach $75, it would cost its econ -0.7% of GDP & 0.8% fall in employment (150.000 more unemployed ppl) — Jorge Valero (@europressos) May 8, 2018 The US President's decision is extremely irresponsible. #IranNuclearDeal is a big diplomatic success that benefits the entire international community and the Iranian people.
