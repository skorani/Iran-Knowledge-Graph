Ayatollah Khamenei’s Fateful Choice	Advertisement Supported by Editorial By  In the 13 years since Iran’s nuclear program was discovered, the Iranians have worked to keep the program alive and the major powers at bay. Now they are jeopardizing the nuclear agreement that would benefit them and the security of the region. The agreement, under negotiation with the United States, Britain, France, Russia, China and Germany, is supposed to be completed on June 30, though a delay is now considered likely. The by Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the final word on whether Iran finally accepts a deal to curb the nuclear program in exchange for a lifting of international sanctions, appeared to stiffen his hard line against concessions. He said on Tuesday that he would not abide any long-term freeze on Iran’s sensitive nuclear work and again ruled out foreign inspections of Iranian military sites. He also insisted that all economic sanctions be lifted immediately once a deal is signed and that verification by the International Atomic Energy Agency of Iran’s obligations under the deal would not be allowed. His statements are at odds with a framework agreement reached on April 2 in which Iran agreed it would sharply constrain the enrichment of uranium for at least 10 years, block the production of plutonium and curb nuclear research and development. Iran also agreed to undertake key tasks — like moving excess centrifuges to storage — before sanctions are lifted, and submit to broad verification by the international agency. Western officials also say Iran has agreed to a process of “managed access” that would allow inspectors to visit suspicious locations, including military sites. If Ayatollah Khamenei’s intention is to maneuver for advantage, his public demands in reopening settled commitments will undercut rather than strengthen the hands of his negotiators. Of course, it’s also possible that he now has no intention of accepting any nuclear agreement with the West. That would be a missed opportunity for Iran and the world and could have dangerous consequences. As the negotiations approach the deadline, some in the United States are also intensifying their criticism against the deal. One goal of the agreement is to ensure that the time it will take Iran to produce enough fissile material for a nuclear bomb is increased from three months now to at least 12 months. Some critics argue the deal does not do that, in part because Iran will retain a small enrichment program and thousands of centrifuges, though many leading technical experts say it does. Other critics accuse the Obama administration of dropping a demand that Iran disclose full details of its past efforts to pursue a nuclear weapon. But the April framework specifies that Iran address those concerns, and Secretary of State John Kerry on June 16 that Iran would have to answer outstanding questions about the weapons program before receiving significant sanctions relief under any deal. Compromises are part of any negotiation. Any agreement can really be judged only when the text is signed and details are made public. The April framework accord was a solid basis on which to build a credible final deal. Ayatollah Khamenei must decide whether he and his government can live with the economic and political consequences if he sabotages this deal.

Disarmament Groups Welcome Iran Framework; Israel Is Mistrustful	Advertisement Supported by By  and Advocates of disarmament and reconciliation with embraced the announced Thursday that would limit Iran’s nuclear capabilities, calling it a welcome alternative to war, while the Israeli government and its supporters voiced deep criticism and said the opposite outcome was more likely. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said he had told President Obama in a telephone call that “a deal based on this framework would threaten the survival of Israel.” In Tehran, , which could portend the end to burdensome sanctions on the country, brought no immediate official reaction from Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who will have the final word on a completed agreement. But state-run television, in what appeared to be a precedent as well as a sign of top-level approval, broadcast live Mr. Obama’s announcement from the White House about the agreement’s details. The Arms Control Association, a nonpartisan group in Washington, called the framework agreement a “historic breakthrough” that, if fully carried out, would block potential Iranian pathways to a bomb. The group said the agreement “promises to lead to one of the most consequential and far-reaching nuclear nonproliferation achievements in recent decades.” The National Iranian American Council, an advocacy group in Washington, said that if the framework agreement led to a final deal by June 30, as negotiators hope and expect, it would achieve “through diplomacy what neither war nor sanctions could ever have accomplished.” The agreement was reached in Lausanne, Switzerland, between Iran and the group of powers known as the P5-plus-1 — Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States — and it contained what disarmament experts said were surprisingly specific provisions. Iran agreed to reduce by roughly two-thirds the number of installed centrifuges it has for enriching uranium fuel, and to take other steps to limit its uranium enrichment. It agreed to dismantle and rebuild a reactor so that it would not produce plutonium fuel, and to allow extensive inspections to assure the world of its peaceful intent. In exchange, the P5-plus-1 powers would lift the array of sanctions that have been imposed on Iran for years. In , which considers Iran its most dangerous enemy, the official reaction to the framework agreement was, not unexpectedly, harsh and mistrustful. Mr. Netanyahu, an outspoken critic of the nuclear negotiations, reiterated in a statement issued by his office what he had told Congress in Washington last month. “Such a deal would not block Iran’s path to the bomb,” he said. “It would pave it.” He and other Israeli officials sought to cast Iran as an expansionary and deceitful power that is bent on destroying Israel and meddling in Israel’s neighbors. “The smiles in Lausanne are detached from the wretched reality where Iran refuses to make concessions on the nuclear issues and continues to threaten Israel and the rest of the countries of the Middle East,” said Yuval Steinitz, the intelligence minister. The World Jewish Congress, an umbrella group of communities in 100 countries, was less critical, but still highly skeptical. Its president, Ronald S. Lauder, said in a statement that “the key question was if Iran could be trusted to implement the deal.” The Al Manar broadcasting channel of Hezbollah, the Shiite militant organization in Lebanon that is an important Iranian ally, carried Mr. Obama’s speech and showed a logo of Ayatollah Khamenei and the slogan: “Victory for Steadfastness.” Whether Iran is racing toward nuclear weapon capabilities is one of the most contentious foreign-policy issues challenging the West. The framework agreement is bound to be seen as a boon by Hezbollah, which relies on Iran for financing and weapons, and has lately claimed to see common interests with the United States in fighting Al Qaeda and the Islamic State. Hezbollah’s Saudi-backed Sunni political rival in Lebanon, the Future Movement, has been wary of an Iran deal. Syria’s state news agency did not immediately react. But the deal would most likely help President Bashar al-Assad of Syria by lifting sanctions on Iran, which has subsidized Syria’s government in a civil war now four years old. Mr. Assad’s opponents by and large argue that the United States has sacrificed them and their movement in order to prioritize the Iran deal. Britain and France, members of the group of big powers that negotiated the deal, praised the outcome but cautioned that a final agreement must still be finished and signed. President François Hollande of France warned in a statement that “sanctions that are lifted can be reimposed if the deal is not applied,” adding that Paris would watch closely to ensure that “a credible, verifiable agreement be established under which the international community can be sure Iran will not be in a position to have access to nuclear arms.” The British foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, said the “extremely tough” talks had provided a good basis to reach what could be a comprehensive deal. “This is well beyond what many of us thought possible even 18 months ago and a good basis for what I believe could be a very good deal,” Mr. Hammond said in a statement. “But there is still more work to do.” Mr. Hammond said a fuller deal that kept to the parameters of the initial agreement would provide reassurance that Tehran’s nuclear program was peaceful, but added that intensive talks on the details now lay ahead, especially about oversight measures and mechanisms regarding United Nations Security Council resolutions.

Israel’s Unworkable Demands on Iran	Advertisement Supported by Editorial By  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has gone into overdrive against a nuclear agreement with Iran. On Monday, his government that it claimed would ensure a better deal than the preliminary one that Iran, President Obama and other leaders of major powers announced . The new demands are unrealistic and, if pursued, would not mean a better deal but no deal at all. Mr. Netanyahu is acting as if he alone can dictate the terms of an agreement that took 18 months and involved not just Iran and the United States but Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China. He wants to appear reasonable. “I’m not trying to kill any deal; I’m trying to kill a bad deal,” he said on NBC News’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday. But he offers no workable options. There are important details to be worked out before a final agreement is expected to be concluded by June 30. Even so, the framework is surprisingly comprehensive and offers the best potential for preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. As outlined on Monday by Yuval Steinitz, Israel’s minister of intelligence and strategic affairs, the Israelis are now insisting that Iran end all research and development on advanced centrifuges, which are used to enrich uranium; reduce the number of operating centrifuges at its Natanz plant beyond what was agreed to in the framework; and close its underground enrichment facility at Fordo. Also, Israel has demanded that Iran allow inspections “anywhere, anytime” by international monitors, ship its stockpile of enriched uranium out of the country and disclose past nuclear-related activities that might involve military uses. In any negotiation, there could never be a deal without compromise. It would be preferable if every vestige of Iran’s nuclear program were eradicated. But that was never going to happen, not least because Iran’s know-how could never be erased. Iran’s leaders would not accept a deal in which they did not maintain some elements of a nuclear program tailored for energy and medical purposes — not weapons. Ultimately, Mr. Obama had to make many judgment calls in getting a deal that would prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. The alternative is no deal, and Iran simply moves forward on its nuclear program without any limits. Shuttering Fordo was an early goal, but, in the end, the agreement would allow Iran to keep a small number of centrifuges spinning and to produce medical isotopes at the plant. For the Iranians, it was a matter of political symbolism and jobs to keep the plant open; Mr. Obama apparently felt there were enough protections that he could agree. Ideally, more of the 10,000 centrifuges operating at the Natanz enrichment plant would be stopped, as Israel has demanded, but the agreement would halt 5,000 — a significant reduction. The deal permits Iran to retain only a small amount of enriched uranium and provides for disposing of the rest (including shipping it out of the country). All the options would ensure that Iran can’t enrich the material for nuclear weapons. While the deal does not grant international monitors the right to go anywhere, anytime, it does impose a tough inspection regime and establishes a commission to resolve disputes if Iran blocks access to a suspected site. It allows research on advanced centrifuges, but the machines can’t be used for enrichment for 10 years. There is confusion about how the deal addresses Iran’s willingness to come clean on its past military activities, but experts have said that a final agreement would require Iran to answer all questions before sanctions are lifted. The Israelis have also said there should be no agreement or lifting of sanctions until Iran recognizes Israel. Iran’s hostility and threats toward Israel and its involvement in terrorist activities are heinous and unacceptable. But those issues should be dealt with separately; resolving them should not be made conditions of the nuclear agreement. Getting to a final deal won’t be easy. Mr. Obama must continue to be tough and determined in the coming months of negotiations. Israel’s demands, however, must not become an excuse to scuttle what seems to be a very serious and potentially groundbreaking deal.

Netanyahu Says Final Nuclear Deal Must Include Iran’s Recognition of Israel	Advertisement Supported by By  JERUSALEM — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel introduced a new demand Friday for the final phase of negotiations over Iran’s nuclear program, saying the completed deal must include an “unambiguous Iranian recognition of Israel’s right to exist.” Mr. Netanyahu, the world’s most vocal critic of the emerging agreement between six world powers and Iran, convened a special session of his security cabinet on Friday, hours before the onset of the Passover holiday, to review the framework agreement announced the night before. He emerged the group “is united in strongly opposing the proposed deal,” contending it “would pose a grave danger to the region and to the world, and would threaten the very survival of the state of Israel.” As the negotiations continued furiously in Lausanne, Switzerland, over the past week, Mr. Netanyahu made daily statements railing against them. He emphasized Iran’s involvement in regional conflicts, most recently Yemen, and denounced an Iranian general’s declaration in recent days that “the destruction of Israel is nonnegotiable.” “Well, I want to make clear to all: the survival of Israel is nonnegotiable,” the prime minister declared on Friday. “Israel will not accept an agreement which allows a country that vows to annihilate us to develop nuclear weapons, period.” Israel is not a party to the talks, which aim to reach a final accord by June 30, and at times he has complained of being left out of the loop. But President Obama, in a telephone call to Mr. Netanyahu shortly after the framework was announced, promised to renew security consultations and deepen coordination. A guide to help you navigate the deal between global powers and Tehran. One question going forward is how fiercely Mr. Netanyahu will fight the deal in Congress, where he spoke against it last month at the invitation of the House speaker, John A. Boehner, a Republican, infuriating the White House and some Democratic members. He gave no hint of his next steps in the Friday statement, beyond the demand for recognition. While Mr. Netanyahu had not previously mentioned recognition in regard to Iran, he has made a similar call in recent negotiations with the Palestinians. Asked on Friday about Mr. Netanyahu’s new demand, a State Department spokeswoman, Marie Harf, told reporters in Washington that the negotiations with Iran on the agreement were “only about the nuclear issue.” In the Palestinian arena, Mr. Netanyahu has demanded not only the recognition of Israel’s right to exist – something the leadership has already done — but recognition that Israel is the nation-state of the Jewish people. Without that recognition, the prime minister argues, any peace deal would not necessarily portend the end of the long-running conflict. Mr. Netanyahu’s statement on the Iran deal was his lengthiest and most detailed of the past week. It criticized the framework agreement, saying it leaves “Iran with a vast nuclear infrastructure,” since it does not call for shutting facilities, destroying centrifuges or halting research and development. The prime minister also criticized the promise to “lift sanctions immediately,” saying it “would greatly bolster Iran’s economy” and “give Iran thereby tremendous means to propel its aggression and terrorism throughout the Middle East.” “Such a deal does not block Iran’s path to the bomb,” he said, reprising language he used in his speech to Congress. “Such a deal paves Iran’s path to the bomb.” The alternative, he said, is not war, but “standing firm, increasing the pressure on Iran until a good deal is achieved.” Rick Gladstone contributed reporting from New York.

None	Federica Mogherini, left, the European Unionâs foreign policy chief, and Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif of Iran announced the details of the agreement. Questions about issues in the news for students 13 and older. Ever since the Iranian Revolution and the Iran hostage crisis, the United States and Iran have not had formal diplomatic relations. George W. Bush famously called Iran a part of the “axis of evil” in his . But on Thursday, the United States announced that it had reached a framework agreement with Iran to prevent it from developing nuclear weapons. When should countries negotiate with their traditional enemies? Do you think negotiating with Iran is good foreign policy? In Michael R. Gordon and David E. Sanger write: LAUSANNE, Switzerland â Iran and the world powers said here Thursday that they had reached a surprisingly specific and comprehensive general understanding about the next steps in limiting Tehranâs nuclear program, though Western officials said many details needed to be resolved before a final agreement in June. Both Germanyâs foreign office and President Hassan Rouhani of Iran said that the major parameters of a framework for a final accord had been reached, after eight days of intense debate between Secretary of State John Kerry and his Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif. There was no mistaking the upbeat mood surrounding the announcement. âWe have stopped a cycle that is not in the interest of anybody,â an exuberant Mr. Zarif said at a news conference after the announcement. Speaking from the White House, President Obama made a strong case for the deal, saying that it âcuts off every pathwayâ for Iran to develop a nuclear weapon and that it establishes the most intrusive inspections system in history. âIf Iran cheats,â he said, âthe world will know it.â Even two of the most skeptical experts on the negotiations â Gary Samore and Olli Heinonen of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard and members of a group call United Against Nuclear Iran â said they were impressed with the depth of detail. Mr. Samore, who was Mr. Obamaâs top adviser on weapons of mass destruction in his first term as president, said in an email that there is âmuch detail to be negotiated but I think itâs enough to be called a political framework.â Just a day ago, that appeared in doubt. Read the entire article, then tell us … â When should countries negotiate with their traditional enemies? How can a country know when negotiating will most likely lead to more conflict down the line, and when diplomacy can actually promote peace? â Do you think negotiating with Iran is good foreign policy? Or should the United States keep trying to weaken Iran through economic sanctions to yield more concessions in the future? Why? â Republican senators, critical of President Obama’s negotiation strategy, recently to Iran’s leaders warning them that an agreement with the Obama administration might not last and could be revoked “with the stroke of a pen.” Do you think Republicans are correct in attempting to undercut a possible deal with Iran? â President Obama recently with Cuba, another traditional United States enemy.

Countries should negotiate with  their traditional enemies when their traditional enemies declare war without any accusations or specific reasons or when they  break a specific law. Yes, I Do. I Support HIs Administration negotiation because everyone deserves a second chance. I don’t think countries should ever negotiate with enemies, especially since it is one of the big five. Iran, Russia, China, Venezuela, and North Korea. They all work together. Russia and Iran have the crude oil. Venezuela has the oil refineries. China has two aircraft carriers. We have less than eleven. North Korea has it’s arms and hacking. What do they all have in common? They all hate America. We don’t negotiate with terrorists. We need to weaken our enemies. Bring them crashing down. Have them begging us for mercy. That’s a big reason why Ronald Reagan was the best president. Carter was going to submit to the soviets. Reagan made the soviets submit to America. The Second World War. Days before the start of war. Germany and the U.S.S.R. made a pact. Made a pact to not attack each other. Surprise! Germany invaded the U.S.S.R. Doesn’t history repeat itself? Cuba? You mean the ones who agreed to set up nuclear missile silos against the U.S. The one who reluctantly took them down? Who disagreed with Gorbachev when we weren’t going to have WWIII? What could possibly go wrong? Hmmm. Let’s think about that for a second. Treaties. Never. Last. I think the traditional enemies must negotiate their countries.The countries can know the time with tradicionsles enemy and also with the line. They must also have peace. I think if you can do business. I think that if Iran can do business. I think not that that if Iran can do business …. poruqe he is good man who can do things for himself. Iran if you can negotiate aterior. I think that if Republicans are not correct but should put according to Iran. I think not deverian should support Obama and support to Cuba. Because Obama is doing than those roles Fayan to their countries and Cuba does not. I think that Cuba can not support Obama for not think they lleban by the way they are. It’s okay if they support Obama Cuba will not peliar that supported Obama .. My thinking is to support Cuba’s is the best there is more than Obama. We have had two disasters of wars in the Middle East and Afghanistan killing thousands of Americans and uncounted numbers of Iraqis and Afghans. Now people are pushing to attack Iran. President Obama is doing the right thing.  Negotiation is the best plan Always. As soon as possible. As calm as possible. Would you ever believe that all these  US flags on the streets of Havana ( clothes,hats,cars, toys, etc. )would ever ever  be seen???? It s the photo of the year and the success of the decade.

Iran Assails U.S. Plan for a Vote in Congress	Advertisement Supported by By  and TEHRAN — ’s president on Wednesday dismissed the compromise worked out between the Obama administration and Congress over an impending nuclear agreement as internal American politics, saying the Iranians were negotiating with six countries, not just with the United States. The president, Hassan Rouhani, also repeated Iran’s position that onerous economic sanctions that have been imposed on the country for years by the United Nations, the United States and the European Union must be lifted with the signing of any final agreement. The remarks by Mr. Rouhani, a prime architect of a reached April 2 with the so-called P5-plus-1 group of powers — Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States — amounted to the first official Iranian reaction to a reached on Tuesday between the White House and the Senate over the nuclear negotiations. American and Iranian officials are using different words to describe elements of the preliminary agreement to limit Iran’s nuclear program. In what was seen by some as a setback for the White House, the compromise, in the form of a Senate bill, would give lawmakers a greater say in the terms of a final deal, which negotiators of Iran and the P5-plus-1 group are working to complete by June 30. Republicans and some Democrats in Congress, highly suspicious of Iran’s motivations, have expressed worry that provisions of the framework agreement are too lenient toward Iran and would leave it with the capacity to divert enrichment to make bombs, despite Iran’s guarantees that its purposes are peaceful. ’s government, which considers Iran its most dangerous enemy, has expressed the same doubts. “I declare here that whatever the says and what the House of Representatives and radicals in America are after, what the mercenaries in the region say, is not related to our nation and the government,” Mr. Rouhani said during a speech in northern Iran reported by state news media. “We request cooperation for cooperation, good will for good will, respect for respect,” Mr. Rouhani said. “We declare to you that we are not negotiating with the U.S. Senate or the House of Representatives. The party we are negotiating with is called the P5-plus-1 group.” Mr. Rouhani drew loud applause by emphasizing Iran’s position that any nuclear agreement was predicated on a termination of all the sanctions, which have severely impaired the country’s economy. As Iran and world powers including the United States try to reach a deal on nuclear controls in exchange for the lifting of sanctions, Iranians from all walks of life are watching and hoping for a new start. “Let the world, the P5-plus-1, the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate, the U.S. president and the U.S. government, let everybody know that if there is not going to be an end to sanctions in this round of the talks, there is not going to be a deal,” he said. “At the end of these talks and upon the time of signing the deal there should be an announcement on the end and lifting of the oppressive sanctions against the Iranian nation.” In Israel, officials welcomed the compromise reached in Washington, with Yuval Steinitz, the minister of intelligence and strategic affairs, describing the congressional move as “an achievement for Israeli policy.” He credited the by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as “decisive” in developing the bill, which Mr. Steinitz called “a very important element in preventing a bad deal.” “This is more pressure and another barrier in the face of a bad agreement,” Mr. Steinitz, who lobbied in London and Paris before the framework was announced, said on Israel Radio on Wednesday. “Therefore the administration and the negotiating team will make more of an effort to seal gaps and to achieve an agreement that looks better, or is at least more reasonable, so that it will pass in Congress.” Thomas Erdbrink reported from Tehran, and Rick Gladstone from New York.

None	With less than a week to go before the June 30 deadline for a nuclear deal between Iran and the major powers, there is an intensifying debate in Washington about the strengths and weaknesses of any agreement that might emerge. There are also growing questions about whether â after 19 months of negotiation â an agreement is even possible, given what appears to be a growing intransigence on the Iranian side. If the major powers and Iran clinchÂ an accord on Iranâs nuclear program, it will be a major contribution to regional security. Thatâs because an agreement wonât happen â and shouldnât happen â unless it significantly constrains Iranâs ability to produce a nuclear weapon for a decade or more and subjects Iran to intrusive international inspections. The tradeoff for Iran is a lifting of international economic sanctions that have substantially crippled its economy and the potential of greater engagement with the international community. It is a complicated negotiation â involving the United States, Britain, France, China, Russia and Germany as well as Iran â and there are many interlocking parts affecting all aspects of Iranâs program. Here is a selection of documents, reports and analyses that can help shed light on this important topic: Advertisement
Obama Denounces Attempts to Derail Nuclear Deal With Iran	Advertisement Supported by By  PANAMA — President Obama fiercely defended the framework nuclear agreement with Iran on Saturday and criticized those Republicans he said were politicizing foreign policy and working to derail the deal. “I don’t understand why it is that everybody’s working so hard to anticipate failure,” Mr. Obama said of the negotiations to hammer out a final nuclear accord, during a news conference at the end of a summit meeting of Latin American nations here. “My simple point is let’s wait and see what the deal is.” He said he remained “absolutely positive” that if a final agreement codified the commitments agreed upon earlier this month, it would be the best way of preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. And he said that he was worried that Republican critics of the deal were trying to “screw up” its completion. American and Iranian officials are using different words to describe elements of the preliminary agreement to limit Iran’s nuclear program. Mr. Obama singled out Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who he said had suggested that Secretary of State John Kerry was “somehow less trustworthy” than Iran’s supreme leader in describing the deal, calling it “an indication of the degree to which partisanship has crossed all boundaries.” “That’s not how we’re supposed to run foreign policy,” Mr. Obama said. “That’s a problem. It needs to stop.” As he departed the summit meeting where a historic meeting with President Raúl Castro of Cuba provided concrete evidence of one of his most significant foreign policy achievements, Mr. Obama faced mounting questions about another goal — . The framework was forged in Switzerland this month, and American negotiators and allies are working with Iran to finalize an agreement by June 30. “We’ve got work until the end of June to make sure that we’ve got a document that works,” Mr. Obama said. “If, in fact, we’re not satisfied that it cuts off the pathways for Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon, then we won’t sign it.” A guide to help you navigate the deal between global powers and Tehran. Mr. Obama is facing a double bind over the next two months with the deal pending. Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has suggested that his country will not comply with crucial conditions, including unfettered access to nuclear sites. He has insisted that sanctions be lifted immediately after a deal is signed, something the United States has said would not happen. Closer to home, the Republican-led Congress is demanding review power over any agreement, and will begin considering bipartisan legislation next week that would allow them to review the deal, vote to disapprove it and limit Mr. Obama’s ability to waive sanctions. Some Republican critics of the accord, including Mr. McCain, have seized upon the assertions of Iran’s leaders to argue that Mr. Obama is on the brink of ceding too much in the talks. “It’s not surprising to me that the supreme leader or a whole bunch of other people are going to try to characterize the deal in a way that protects their political position, but I know what was discussed in arriving at the political agreement,” Mr. Obama said. As for Congress, he said he had talked to Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and a sponsor of the review bill, and Senator Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland, the panel’s senior Democrat, about how to give Congress a voice in the debate. “I want to work with them so that Congress can look at this deal when it’s done,” Mr. Obama said. “What I’m concerned about is making sure that we don’t prejudge it,” he added, or allow opponents of the deal to “try to use a procedural argument essentially to screw up the possibility of a deal.” Advertisement
None	Is the White House trolling Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel to sell the nuclear framework deal with Iran? It certainly appeared that way on Wednesday, when the official White House Twitter account posted a graphic depicting a cartoon bomb with its fuse being snipped to illustrate how the accord would âshut down Iranâs pathway to a nuclear weapon.â The picture (hashtagged, naturally, #Iran Deal) was reminiscent of a diagram Mr. Netanyahu presented to the United Nations in September 2012 that showed a bomb with a fuse sticking out of the top and a blast at the end. He wielded a red marker to draw a line showing his determination to halt Iranâs program before it developed a nuclear weapon. Worth sharing: Here's how the would shut down Iran's pathway to a nuclear weapon â  — The White House (@WhiteHouse) The White House version has a red line at just the same point, to describe what it says would happen without a diplomatic accord with Iran, ticking off a list of activities â including uranium enrichment and stockpiles and the development of more centrifuges â that could allow Iran to quickly develop a nuclear weapon. But it also has a blue line at the bottom, linked to a list of ways administration officials say the deal would thwart those moves, such as eliminating Iranâs stores of highly enriched uranium, limiting and vastly reducing its low-enriched uranium stockpile, and cutting its centrifuges by two-thirds. The Twitter post is apparently just one part of an elaborate sales pitch President Obama is making to build support in Congress and around the world for the proposed nuclear deal, to which Mr. Netanyahu has expressed fierce opposition. And maybe, after a season of public hostility between Mr. Obama and Mr. Netanyahu over the Iran deal, among other matters, a little bit of a dig at the worldâs most prominent critic of the agreement.

None	Hillary Rodham Clinton called the framework for an Iran nuclear deal that was reached on Thursday an âimportant step,” adding that while âthe devil is always in the detailsâ in such negotiations, âdiplomacy deserves a chance to succeed.â The comments, in a statement issued Thursday evening by a spokesman, are Mrs. Clintonâs first on the negotiations since they became a flash point in Israeli elections last month. âThe understanding that the major world powers have reached with Iran is an important step toward a comprehensive agreement that would prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon and strengthen the security of the United States, Israel and the region,â Mrs. Clinton said. âPresident Obama and Secretary Kerry have been persistent and determined in pursuit of this goal, building on a decade of bipartisan pressure and diplomacy,â she added, referring to Secretary of State John Kerry. âGetting the rest of the way to a final deal by June wonât be easy, but it is absolutely crucial. I know well that the devil is always in the details in this kind of negotiation.” Mrs. Clinton, who is all but certain to seek the presidency in 2016, said she supported the Obama administration in trying, between now and June, to achieve a deal that âverifiably cuts off all of Iranâs paths to a nuclear weapon, imposes an intrusive inspection program with no sites off limits, extends breakout time, and spells out clear and overwhelming consequences for violations.â âThe onus is on Iran and the bar must be set high,â she said. âIt can never be permitted to acquire a nuclear weapon. It is also vital that these efforts be part of a comprehensive strategy to check Iran’s regional ambitions, defend our allies and partners and reinforce American leadership in the Middle East.â Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has repeatedly criticized the negotiations to curtail Iran’s nuclear program as ineffective, and on Wednesday he said that a deal would âthreaten the survivalâ of Israel. Mrs. Clinton, who was secretary of state under Mr. Obama when the seeds of the Iran negotiations began, has been measured in discussing them publicly over the last 18 months, supporting the administration but also sounding a note of caution about whether Iran would honor a deal. By MICHAEL R. GORDON and DAVID E. SANGER An understanding was reached about limiting Iranâs nuclear program, but key issues remain before a final agreement in June. Like the Politics Newsletter?

Iran to Restart Some Nuclear Activity in Response to U.S. Withdrawal From Nuclear Deal	Advertisement Supported by By  GENEVA — Iran will restart part of its halted nuclear program in response to the U.S. withdrawal from a landmark 2015 nuclear deal but does not itself plan to pull out of the agreement, the state-run IRIB news agency reported on Monday. Citing a source close to an official commission which oversees the nuclear deal, IRIB reported that President Hassan Rouhani would announce that Iran would reduce some of its "minor and general" commitments under the deal on May 8 - exactly one year after U.S. President Donald Trump announced the U.S. pullout. Trump subsequently reimposed tough sanctions on Iran, including on its lifeblood oil exports with the stated intent of reducing them to zero and starving Iran's economy. "The Islamic Republic of Iran in reaction to the exit of America from the nuclear deal and the bad promises of European countries in carrying out their obligations will restart a part of the nuclear activities which were stopped under the framework of the nuclear deal," the source said, according to IRIB. Similarly, the semi-official Iranian Students' News Agency (ISNA) reported that Iran on Wednesday will announce "reciprocal actions" to the U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal, quoting "knowledgeable sources". Some European Union leaders had been unofficially told of Iran's decision, the report said. The United States acted on Friday to force Iran to stop producing low-enriched uranium and expanding its only nuclear power plant. Trump, who was not in office when the nuclear deal was negotiated, said it was flawed in Iran's favor for doing nothing to curb its ballistic missile program or its support of proxy forces in several Middle East wars. Iran has said its development of ballistic missiles has nothing to do with its nuclear activity and is wholly defensive in nature, and that its support for allies around the Middle East is not Washington's business. U.S. DEPLOYMENT TO MIDDLE EAST Under the 2015 deal, Iran restricted the capacity of its uranium enrichment program - widely seen as a route to developing a nuclear weapon - in exchange for a lifting of most international sanctions. U.N. nuclear inspectors have repeatedly verified Iranian compliance with the accord. Iran has denied ever pursuing a nuclear weapons program. The other signatories to the deal - European powers Germany, France and Britain - and Russia and China remain committed to it. The EU has been looking into ways of preserving its economic benefits that Iran says must stay or it could abandon the deal. The Trump administration is now deploying a carrier strike group and bombers to the Middle East in response to troubling "indications and warnings" from Iran and to show the United States will retaliate with "unrelenting force" to any attack, U.S. national security adviser John Bolton said on Sunday. Bolton - who has spearheaded an increasingly hawkish U.S. policy on Iran - said the decision, which could exacerbate tensions between the two countries, was meant to send a “clear and unmistakable message” of U.S. resolve to Tehran. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also issued a warning to the Islamic Republic on Sunday. "It is absolutely the case that we have seen escalatory actions from the Iranians and it is equally the case that we will hold the Iranians accountable for attacks on American interests," Pompeo told reporters aboard a flight en route to an Arctic Council meeting in Finland. If these actions take place, if they do by some third-party proxy, a militia group, Hezbollah, we will hold the Iranian leadership directly accountable for that.” (Reporting by Babak Dehghanpisheh with additional reporting by Lesley Wroughton; Editing by Mark Heinrich and Raissa Kasolowsky) Advertisement

Iran’s Supreme Leader Says Sanctions Must Lift When Nuclear Deal Is Signed	Advertisement Supported by By  and TEHRAN — ’s supreme leader on Thursday challenged two of the United States’ bedrock principles in the nuclear negotiations, declaring that all economic sanctions would have to be lifted on the day any final agreement was signed and that military sites would be strictly off limits to foreign inspectors. The assertions by the leader, Ayatollah , could be tactical, intended to give both the negotiators and himself some political space to get Iran’s hard-liners accustomed to the reached a week ago with the United States and other world powers. But they sharply illustrated the difficult hurdles that lie ahead as Secretary of State John Kerry and a large team of diplomats, energy experts and intelligence officials try to reach a June 30 deadline that would ensure that Iran could not race for a bomb for at least a decade — and would establish a permanent inspection regime to catch any cheating. In his remarks, Ayatollah Khamenei added several stinging criticisms of Iran’s regional competitor, Saudi Arabia — calling its new leaders “inexperienced youths” — a sign of rising regional tensions that could pose another threat to the negotiations, even as diplomats strive to keep the issues on separate tracks. King Salman, the country’s newly installed leader, is 79, though many around him are a generation younger. Saudi Arabia is currently allied with the United States against Iran in the developing civil war in Yemen, which is fast becoming a major source of regional instability. Mr. Kerry accused Tehran this week of direct military support to the rebels there and warned Tehran to back off. Ayatollah Khamenei’s comments were the first time he has discussed the framework that emerged from the nuclear talks last week in Lausanne, Switzerland. His pronouncements are considered vital because they shape the “red lines” for Iranian negotiators, though they have often showed considerable flexibility in working out details that seem to adhere to his literal meaning while still accommodating some Western demands. For example, he had previously required that no nuclear facilities could be closed, but under the framework accord one of them — Fordo, a deep underground enrichment site — is being converted to a research center where fissile material is banned. Another, a heavy-water reactor, is being redesigned to prevent it from making bomb-grade plutonium. On Tuesday night the director of the C.I.A., John O. Brennan, said he believed Ayatollah Khamenei had been persuaded, over the past two years, that an accord was necessary to avoid an economic free fall in Iran. But the ayatollah himself said Thursday that he saw no need to make a clear pronouncement on the deal because no signed agreement yet existed. But he emphasized his longstanding position about the sanctions, saying that they “should be lifted all together on the same day of the agreement, not six months or one year later.” The Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, who spoke at a different event on Thursday, echoed the supreme leader’s remarks but with a potentially crucial difference, saying the sanctions have to be lifted on the day a deal is put in place, potentially months after a signed agreement. “We will not sign any agreement unless all economic sanctions are totally lifted on the first day of the implementation of the deal,” Mr. Rouhani said during a ceremony for Iran’s nuclear technology day, which celebrates the country’s nuclear achievements. While the June 30 deadline is still months away, the ayatollah’s comments pose some significant potential challenges to Mr. Kerry and his negotiating team. Mr. Kerry and President Obama have been saying that sanctions would be suspended in phases, as Iran complied with its obligations. That is critical to American leverage in making sure that Iran follows through on its commitments to vastly reduce its uranium stockpile — a process that will take months, if not longer — and decommissions centrifuges, placing them in storage. On Wednesday night, on the “PBS NewsHour,” Mr. Kerry said that in any final agreement, Iran would also have to resolve outstanding questions with the International Atomic Energy Agency over suspected military dimensions of the . “It will be part of a final agreement,” he said. “It has to be.” American and Iranian officials are using different words to describe elements of the preliminary agreement to limit Iran’s nuclear program. Mr. Kerry’s assurances did little to mollify the deal’s many congressional critics, who pounced on Ayatollah Khamenei’s comments as proof that the nuclear deal is unworkable. “As each new day reveals a new disagreement, it’s increasingly clear that Iran, in fact, failed to reach agreement with the United States and its partners on a political framework that addresses all parameters of a comprehensive agreement,” said Senator Mark Kirk, Republican of Illinois. who has led an effort to impose new sanctions on Iran — a step President Obama says is clearly intended to blow up any progress that has been made. In his remarks Thursday, Ayatollah Khamenei seemed to rule out any inspections inside military bases or compounds. That could become problematic. While Mr. Obama and Mr. Kerry have said the inspection requirements they have negotiated would be among the most intrusive in history, they have not said whether they would extend to military sites. Several of the sites the United States is most concerned about in Iran are on military bases, including Fordo. Inspectors have visited the site regularly, and the atomic energy agency has, periodically, been allowed onto other military bases. Similarly, the timing of sanctions relief is far more complicated than simply setting a date. Even with cooperation from the Iranian side, the technical issues are so complex that agency officials say resolving them will be a lengthy process. As Iran and world powers including the United States try to reach a deal on nuclear controls in exchange for the lifting of sanctions, Iranians from all walks of life are watching and hoping for a new start. Mr. Obama can suspend some of the United States sanctions with the stroke of a pen, but actually terminating them would require congressional action. Other sanctions are based on United Nations Security Council resolutions. Mr. Kerry said in Lausanne last week that under a final deal, if one is reached, a new set of resolutions would be passed, ending many of the sanctions but keeping proliferation controls in place. Even if sanctions are legally eliminated, major corporate players may initially be reluctant to do business in Iran. Banks have been heavily fined for violations and would want assurances about the new rules. Investors may fear that sanctions could “snap back” if there was a dispute between Iran and the West, leaving their investments stranded. Ayatollah Khamenei may have thrown another new factor into the equation by suggesting there was plenty of time to consider a deal and review the actions of opponents, and said the deadline of June 30 was in no way sacred. “They might say that we have only three months left. Well, if three months becomes four months the sky won’t come falling down,” he said. “Just as the other side pushed the negotiations back by seven months,” he added, referring to an extension decided in November. A guide to help you navigate the deal between global powers and Tehran. However, June 30 is the date at which the current extension of negotiations runs out. So unless it is renewed — something both sides have previously rejected — the temporary limits on Iran’s enrichment activities will terminate that day. And after June 30, Congress has threatened to impose new sanctions if a satisfactory deal is not in place. Ayatollah Khamenei did not criticize those details of the framework that had already been agreed to, even though some of them, if put in place, would represent big compromises from all parties, including Iran. He repeated that while he was not optimistic about negotiating with world powers — especially with the United States — he did support the talks and Iran’s diplomatic team. “I have agreed to this particular instance of negotiations and I support the negotiators,” Ayatollah Khamenei said, according to his official website, . In recent days, almost all major figures in the Iranian establishment have , while adding the usual caveat that Iran’s rights must be guaranteed. Most, including Friday Prayer leaders and military commanders, have said they supported the talks. Yet, speaking to an audience of religious chanters in his Tehran office, the ayatollah said the government should allow critics of the deal to speak their minds, “as it will help unity” in the country. It must be clear, the ayatollah said, that the negotiations were not going beyond the nuclear field. “But,” he continued, “if the other side refrains from its normal bad actions, this will become an experience that we can continue on other issues. If we see that once again they repeat their bad actions, it will only strengthen our experience of not trusting America.” With the ayatollah’s unusually strong remarks about the Saudis on Thursday, the sectarian-tinged seemed potentially to be developing into yet another wedge between Washington and Tehran.

Trump Vandalizes the Iran Deal	Advertisement Supported by By  Opinion Columnist President Trump’s attempt to blow up the Iranian nuclear deal isn’t foreign policy. It’s vandalism. Trump is abandoning the Iran deal, with nothing to replace it, even though his own and say that Iran appears to be in compliance; even though his own secretary of defense says that staying in the deal is in America’s interest; even though our allies are pleading to stick with it. The reason for Trump’s decision seems obvious: The deal was President Barack Obama’s. This petty retreat from diplomacy is the most significant national security move Trump has made. It means that Trump is isolating the United States, not Iran, and it increases the risk of military conflict down the road. If there’s anything we should have learned, it’s to avoid unnecessary wars in the Middle East — but Trump may be laying the groundwork for yet another. “Many regard the invasion of Iraq as the worst foreign policy move in the history of the American republic,” James Dobbins, a much respected retired diplomat, tweeted after Trump’s speech. “Now we have a competitor.” The Iranian deal may not permanently solve the problem of Iran’s pursuit of nuclear weapons, but it delays any crisis for nearly 15 years or more. Trump doesn’t want to risk a possible crisis then, so he chooses to have one now — apparently, just for the satisfaction of kicking sand at Obama. A crisis won’t necessarily result right away. It could be some months before sanctions would actually kick in, and in any case Iranian President Hassan Rouhani that the nuclear deal could remain in place even if the Americans pull out. Rather, Iran may try for moderation to peel European allies away from America — and Trump is playing into this Iranian strategy. Some in the international community will regard the actions of President Trump and of Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, and see Khamenei as more of a statesman. Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seems to be itching for a joint American-Israeli strike on Iran. Netanyahu may see political advantages to a triumphant airstrike, and I fear Trump might as well. Trump may have absorbed the unfortunate lesson from his military strikes on Syria that when he fires missiles, he is hailed as presidential. I’m told that the United States years ago secretly built a replica of the Iranian complex at Fordo, which is deep underground to protect it from bombings, and practiced striking it with new munitions to see whether it could be destroyed. Based on those tests, America could indeed destroy Fordo — and that will give hawks in the Trump administration, like John Bolton, more confidence as they advocate military options down the road. Bolton is smart and knowledgeable, but his hawkish approach also has a track record. Let’s see how it did in three cases: First, Bolton agitated for the Iraq War and still considers the invasion to have been a wise decision. The war, remember, killed , about half a million Iraqis, and cost the U.S. some $3 trillion — or $24,000 per American household. Second, Bolton in 2002 helped kill the Agreed Framework that had kept North Korea from building a single nuclear warhead during the Clinton years. North Korea was secretly evading the framework, so tough negotiation was required — but instead Bolton helped blow up the deal, and since then North Korea has conducted six nuclear tests and developed intercontinental missiles that can reach the U.S. Third, Bolton in 2003 and 2004 helped end a European initiative to reach a deal with Iran on nuclear issues at that time, when the program was in much earlier stages. In each of these cases, Bolton and the hawks were right that diplomacy was a flawed tool and might not have achieved our objectives: In international relations, there are more problems than solutions. What is clear is that the hawkish non-diplomatic paths failed catastrophically. A basic problem with military options is that, as the Prussian strategist Helmuth Von Moltke observed, no military plan survives first contact with the enemy. After a strike, Iran might try to blow up Saudi oil installations, or block oil exports through the Strait of Hormuz, or it could use its proxies in Lebanon to stir up a war with Israel. I’ve reported in Iran ( by secret police and accused of spying), and I know full well that the regime is untrustworthy. That’s precisely the reason for the nuclear deal and the rigorous inspections that come with it. For now, the inspectors agree that Iran is essentially in compliance — while by failing to approve licenses for commerce with Iran, and by subverting normal trade relations. So why destroy a deal that is working, other than to dismantle some of Obama’s legacy? “What’s the purpose of all this?” asked Jake Sullivan, a former senior State Department official involved in the outreach to Iran. “You put pressure back on, and what’s the purpose? Is it to achieve a new nuclear deal? Is it about regime change?” Sullivan noted that there’s little chance of Trump actually negotiating a new deal, and added: “So what’s the point of this other than ‘Iranians are bad people and we’re going to hurt them.’ What’s the strategy other than a temper tantrum?” And that’s why I see Trump’s move as less about foreign policy than about vandalism.

After Nuclear Agreement, Analysts Weigh Deal’s Effects on Iranian Politics	Advertisement Supported by By  WASHINGTON — For watchers, a possible deal to rein in the country’s raises questions about its impact not only on arms control in the region but also on Tehran’s complex internal politics. Could a deal, and an easing of sanctions, empower reformers who would like to see an end to the 35-year cold war with America? Or might it set up for blame those who supported the talks, including President Hassan Rouhani, if an agreement produces less in the way of sanctions relief or economic progress than they have promised? Both situations are plausible, according to a range of experts who agree only on the pivotal nature of the talks. The deep divisions in American politics over the nuclear talks are precisely mirrored on the Iranian side, with hard-liners deeply skeptical about whether Iran is giving up too much. But Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah , has publicly expressed support for Iranian negotiators, quieting the skeptics and heartening Iranians who yearn for a breakthrough in their country’s relations with the world. “After three decades of propagating a culture of defiance against the U.S., it will be curious to see whether and how Khamenei spins a nuclear compromise as an act of resistance, not compromise,” said Karim Sadjadpour, who studies Iran at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. A guide to help you navigate the deal between global powers and Tehran. President Obama faces his own chorus of critics on the concessions necessary for a deal. But he is deeply invested in the talks and their potential to change relations with Iran beyond the goal of disrupting its progress toward a nuclear weapon. After the announcement of a framework for a deal on Thursday, a senior Obama administration official noted the volatility of Iranian debate around the nuclear issue. “We all tend to think of Iran as a sort of one-person country, that whatever the supreme leader says goes,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to describe how the framework came about. “Actually, Iran has politics.” “There is no doubt that Javad Zarif will have to sell this deal, just like we will, and his task is not simple or a given,” the official said, referring to Iran’s foreign minister. Independent scholars say Iran and the United States have been at odds for so long that Tehran’s factions have never had to react to a serious reconciliation. “Iran’s civil society, in contrast to its hard-liners, overwhelmingly wants this deal to happen,” Mr. Sadjadpour said. “But there are no guarantees that a nuclear deal will bring about greater political openness within Iran.” He said an internal crackdown after a deal is reached was just as likely if hard-liners want “to signal to people that external flexibility doesn’t signal internal weakness.” As Iran and world powers including the United States try to reach a deal on nuclear controls in exchange for the lifting of sanctions, Iranians from all walks of life are watching and hoping for a new start. Mr. Sadjadpour said that Ayatollah Khamenei would be quick to blame Mr. Rouhani if a deal did not produce sufficient sanctions relief to be felt by most people. The supreme leader, he said, has “undermined and ultimately emasculated every president he’s worked with” to protect himself and the regime. “After 26 years in power, it’s doubtful that he will take a different approach toward Rouhani,” he said. Trita Parsi, president of the National Iranian American Council and an outspoken advocate for improved relations with Tehran, struck a more optimistic note, suggesting that an agreement could be a watershed in internal Iranian affairs. “I think in many ways this is going to be decisive as to who defines Iran for the coming decades,” he said after flying back to Washington on Wednesday from Lausanne, Switzerland, where he was monitoring the talks. “If there’s a good deal, and sanctions are lifted and it boosts the Iranian economy, it will show that the moderates can actually get something done.” Mr. Parsi said that Mr. Rouhani, who took office in August 2013, had been given an extended honeymoon by most Iranians, despite economic stress and other problems, because they prefer his style to that of his more bombastic and divisive predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. “They lived through eight years of the alternative, and they know they don’t like that,” he said. Gary G. Sick, a former National Security Council official and now a Columbia University scholar who has studied Iran for more than four decades, said that Iran’s leaders would place great weight on presenting a deal as a victory, even if they made major concessions in the fine print. Whether Iran is racing toward nuclear weapon capabilities is one of the most contentious foreign-policy issues challenging the West. “They need something to hold up to the populace and say, ‘We’ve stood by our rights and our dignity,’ ” he said. That is in part because Iranian hard-liners, particularly the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, will be looking for ways to attack and undercut any deal, Mr. Sick said. The Revolutionary Guards “thrive on hostile relations with the U.S. and benefit hugely from sanctions, which allow them to control smuggling,” he said. Mr. Sick said he believed that a deal could begin a process of epochal change inside Iran. “If the sanctions are lifted, foreign companies come back in, the natural entrepreneurialism of Iranians is unleashed,” he said, then Iran’s political system will inevitably change, if slowly. “If you want regime change in Iran, meaning changing the way the regime operates, this kind of agreement is the best way to achieve that goal,” he said. Since the Islamic government took power, one side or the other has made a move to improve relations on at least seven occasions, said David B. Crist, a Defense Department historian and author of “The Twilight War,” a 2012 book on American-Iranian relations. Every attempt ended in failure, he said. Against that history, a nuclear deal would be “uncharted territory,” Mr. Crist said. At least initially, he said, a deal would enhance the power of Mr. Rouhani and the Iranian pragmatists, and it would probably lead to permanent diplomatic engagement with the United States. “The flip side of that is the danger of too much engagement, from an Iranian point of view,” he said, adding that the influence of the West could be seen as undermining Iranian youth. “And that could prompt a crackdown domestically.” Julie Hirschfeld Davis contributed reporting from Washington.

Sabotaging a Deal With Iran 	Advertisement Supported by Editorial By  Congressional critics of an emerging international agreement to limit Iran’s nuclear program moved with uncommon speed last week to force a vote that could have blown up the negotiations, which are now at a delicate stage. Cooler heads prevailed, and action was delayed. But Congress could still sabotage the deal. Apparently hoping to capitalize on the fiery denunciation of Iran by the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, in a speech to Congress, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, on Tuesday pressed for a vote this week on a bill that would require congressional review of any deal. But he backed down when the bill’s supporters insisted on delaying any vote until after March 24, the target set by the United States, five other major powers and Iran for reaching a framework agreement. The agreement is intended to offer Iran relief from crippling economic sanctions in return for tough restraints on its nuclear program for at least a decade. In the administration’s view, the agreement will not be a treaty requiring Senate ratification but a political commitment that is well within Mr. Obama’s authority to enter into without congressional approval. Congress’s chief power is that while Mr. Obama can waive certain sanctions on Iran on national security grounds, only Congress can permanently remove them. Congress also can enact new sanctions if Iran violates its commitments. The bill before the Senate could well scuttle any deal. Within five days of concluding an agreement, the president would have to submit the text to Congress as well as an assessment of Iran’s compliance and a certification that the deal does not jeopardize American security. That is an absurdly short timeline. More damaging, the bill would bar the president from easing sanctions on Iran for 65 days so Congress could hold hearings and decide whether to support the deal. The bill would also eliminate the presidential authority Mr. Obama used in 2013 to lift some sanctions against Iran under an interim agreement, thus calling into question America’s credibility and its ability to fulfill its promises under any new deal. And it would add onerous new conditions that have not been part of the negotiations so far. Congress can play a role going forward. One useful way for it to weigh in would be to support legislation introduced by, among others, Senators Barbara and Dianne Feinstein, both California Democrats, that would require Mr. Obama to report to Congress every 90 days on Iran’s compliance with the deal and that sets up an expedited process for Congress to reimpose sanctions if Iran violates its commitments. After more than a year of negotiations, the United States, Britain, France, China, Russia and Germany can take credit for an interim deal that has sharply limited Iran’s nuclear activities, and they are on the verge of a more permanent agreement that could further reduce the risk of Iran’s developing a nuclear weapon. Congress needs to think hard about the best way to support a verifiable nuclear deal and not play political games that could leave America isolated, the sanctions regime in tatters and Iran’s nuclear program unshackled.

The Revolution Lives!	Advertisement Supported by By  Beyond all the talk of centrifuges and enrichment capacities, President Obama’s deal with Iran is really a giant gamble on the nature of the Iranian regime. The core question is: Are the men who control that country more like Lenin or are they more like Gorbachev? Do they still fervently believe in their revolution and would they use their postsanctions wealth to export it and destabilize their region? Or have they lost faith in their revolution? Will they use a deal as a way to rejoin the community of nations? We got a big piece of evidence on those questions on Thursday. Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to the sort-of-agreed-upon nuclear framework. What did we learn? First, we learned that Iran’s supreme leader still regards the United States as his enemy. The audience chanted “Death to America” during his speech, and Khamenei himself dismissed America’s “devilish” intentions. When a radical religious leader uses a word like “devilish,” he’s not using it the way it’s used in a chocolate-cake commercial. He means he thinks the United States is the embodiment of evil. Second, we learned that the West wants a deal more than Khamenei does. “I was never optimistic about negotiating with America,” he declared. Throughout the speech, his words dripped with a lack of enthusiasm for the whole enterprise. President Obama is campaigning for a deal, while Khamenei is unmoved. That imbalance explains why Western negotiators had to give away so many of their original demands. The United States had originally insisted upon an end to Iran’s nuclear program, a suspension of its enrichment of uranium, but that was conceded to keep Iran at the table. Third, we learned that the ayatollah is demanding total trust from us while offering maximum contempt in return. Khamenei communicated a smug and self-righteous sense of superiority toward the West throughout his remarks. He haughtily repeated his demand that the West permanently end all sanctions on the very day the deal is signed. He insisted that no inspectors could visit Iranian military facilities. This would make a hash of verification and enforcement. Fourth, we learned that Khamenei and the U.S. see different realities. It’s been pointed out that Iranian and American officials describe the “agreed upon” framework in different ways. That’s because, Khamenei suggested, the Americans are lying. “I’m really worried as the other side is into lying and breaching promises. An example was the White House fact sheet,” he said. “This came out a few hours after the negotiations, and most of it was against the agreement and was wrong. They are always trying to deceive and break promises.” Fifth, Khamenei reminded us that, even at the most delicate moment in these talks, he is still intent on putting Iran on a collision course with Sunnis and the West. He attacked the Saudi leaders as “inexperienced youngsters” and criticized efforts to push back on Iranian efforts to destabilize Yemen. The foreign minister of the United Arab Emirates, Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed al-Nahyan, characterized Iran’s recent bellicosity this way: “It’s about Iran believing in exporting the revolution. It’s part of their regime, a part of their ideology.” Khamenei’s remarks could be bluster, tactical positioning for some domestic or international audience. But they are entirely consistent with recent Iranian behavior. His speech suggests that Iran still fundamentally sees itself in a holy war with the West, a war that can be managed prudently but that is still a fundamental clash of values and interests. His speech suggests, in a brilliant op-ed essay in The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday, that there is no congruence of interests between us and Iran. We envision a region of stable nation-states. They see a revolutionary anti-Western order. If Iran still has revolutionary intent, then no amount of treaty subtlety will enforce this deal. Iran will begin subtly subverting any agreement. It will continue to work on its advanced nuclear technology even during the agreement. It will inevitably use nuclear weaponry, or even the threat of eventual nuclear weaponry, to advance its apocalyptic interests. Every other regional power will prepare for the worst, and we’ll get a pseudo-nuclear-arms race in a region of disintegrating nation-states. If President Obama is right and Iran is on the verge of change, the deal is a home run. But we have a terrible record of predicting trends in the Middle East. Republican and Democratic administrations have continually anticipated turning points in the Middle East: Republicans after interventions, Democrats after negotiations. But the dawns never come. At some point, there has to be a scintilla of evidence that Iran wants to change. Khamenei’s speech offers none. Negotiating an arms treaty with Brezhnev and Gorbachev was one thing. But with this guy? Good luck with that. Advertisement
Next Round of Nuclear Talks With Iran Set for Next Week	Advertisement Supported by By  TEHRAN — The next round of nuclear talks between world powers and Iran is scheduled for next week in Vienna, as the two sides begin to address the issues they left unresolved earlier this month in Lausanne, Switzerland, and try to conclude a comprehensive agreement by the end of June. American and Iranian officials are using different words to describe elements of the preliminary agreement to limit Iran’s nuclear program. The European Union, the host of the talks, said in a statement released on Thursday that its senior negotiator, Helga Schmid, will meet with Iran’s deputy foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, on Wednesday, to pursue an agreement that would restrict Iran to peaceful research in the nuclear area in exchange for the phased lifting of economic sanctions. After the parties reached a framework agreement in Lausanne, Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, complicated matters by insisting that all and that all military sites would be off limits to inspectors. President Hassan Rouhani on Thursday acknowledged the problems but said he remained optimistic that the negotiators would reach a deal. “There is a difficult path ahead of us towards the final deal,” he said at a news conference during a trip to northern Iran, but the country’s “will and decision is to continue the negotiations until a final deal is reached.” Advertisement
Israeli Response to Iran Nuclear Deal Could Have Broader Implications	Advertisement Supported by News Analysis By  JERUSALEM — It took two days to call Prime Minister of after his March 17 electoral victory, and any of Mr. Netanyahu’s hawkish and divisive campaign rhetoric. It took Mr. Obama about two hours to call Mr. Netanyahu after Thursday’s announcement of a , and this time it was the Israeli leader who lectured the American that the emerging deal “would threaten the survival” of his state. The White House account of the call was conciliatory: The president promised to increase security consultations and cooperation with Israel to “remain vigilant in countering ’s threats.” The relationship between the two leaders, and their nations, has always been asymmetrical: The United States is the world’s sole superpower, Israel a small country in a volatile neighborhood. But while Mr. Obama’s promised reassessment of Washington’s longstanding protection of Israel in the United Nations flexes that larger muscle, Mr. Netanyahu is now in a powerful position to undermine the Iran nuclear deal, his counterpart’s signature foreign policy initiative. How fiercely Israel fights the deal, particularly in Congress, could have broad implications for the strained alliance and the Middle East peace process. “Ironically, just because of this deal, there is a chance that the Americans will try to compensate Israel somehow if we stop fighting against this deal, and we should exploit it in a smart way,” Giora Eiland, a former Israeli national security adviser, said in an interview Friday, noting that Mr. Obama “rushed to call” Mr. Netanyahu and “tried to be as nice as he could.” A guide to help you navigate the deal between global powers and Tehran. Mr. Eiland was one of several Israeli analysts who said the emphasis should turn to strengthening the verification procedures in the deal and clarifying the consequences if Iran violates it. “If Netanyahu chooses this option, at least we can gain some other benefits from the situation rather than to continue to blame and to undermine,” he said. “The time has come to make a real reassessment in regard to the Israel-American relationship.” Though Israeli and American officials have long denied any link between the Iranian and issues, the two are playing out simultaneously. In the coming weeks, , a United Nations Security Council resolution regarding Palestinian statehood. It is not hard to imagine Mr. Obama vowing to block it if Mr. Netanyahu lowers the volume on Capitol Hill. At the same time, Mr. Netanyahu must assemble a new governing coalition, and the Iran deal could put new momentum behind the idea of a unity government with his center-left rival, something Washington might favor. Mr. Netanyahu on Friday introduced a new demand for the nuclear negotiations, saying the final agreement must “include a clear and unambiguous Iranian recognition of Israel’s right to exist.” As he has several times this week, he noted an Iranian general’s recent declaration that “the destruction of Israel is nonnegotiable,” and said, “I want to make clear to all: The survival of Israel is nonnegotiable.” “Israel will not accept an agreement which allows a country that vows to annihilate us to develop , period,” he said. “Some say the only alternative to this bad deal is war. That’s not true. There is a third alternative — standing firm, increasing the pressure on Iran until a good deal is achieved.” The statement, issued in English and Hebrew shortly before the beginning of the holiday, followed a special three-hour session of Israel’s security cabinet, which Mr. Netanyahu said was “united in strongly opposing the proposed deal.” It did not mention Congress or hint at the prime minister’s strategy. Whether Iran is racing toward nuclear weapon capabilities is one of the most contentious foreign-policy issues challenging the West. Dore Gold, a former foreign policy adviser to Mr. Netanyahu who remains in his inner circle, said Friday that “it’s not for Israel to get into legislation” in Congress, but that the world powers negotiating a final deal by June 30 “include parliamentary democracies” and “an active press corps in all countries.” Opponents of the deal in Israel and the United States have been emphasizing what they view as Iran’s expansionary meddling in Iraq, Syria and Yemen as another reason not to trust it. The , a Washington-based policy institute that has been critical of the emerging nuclear deal, Friday that it could “further supercharge Iranian aggression in the region” and encourage Iran’s Sunni Arab adversaries to develop nuclear capabilities. “This is a battle for ideas, and Israel will have to put forth its arguments,” said Mr. Gold, a former Israeli ambassador to the United Nations and president of the “We’re past the elections now in both countries. Everybody is making their case, their point. If the final agreement reflects what’s in this framework, we’re talking about something that is nothing less than a historical error.” Mr. Gold said the framework’s provisions allowing Iran to keep much of its nuclear infrastructure intact, in light of what he called Iran’s history of violating international agreements, was a primary concern. But several Israeli commentators said Friday that the deal looked better than expected, noting that even if it only delays Iran from producing a nuclear weapon by its decade-long duration, that is far longer than what an Israeli or American military strike could achieve. “Even Israel could learn to live with it,” , a security analyst for the news site Ynet. “Put simply, Obama is offering an olive branch to Netanyahu in an attempt to cooperate on the design of the final agreement over the next three months. The Israeli government should warmly embrace the offer without batting an eye.” Nahum Barnea, a columnist for the Israeli daily Yediot Aharonot, described Israel’s crusade against the deal as “a resounding failure,” writing, “As the clash between Netanyahu and Obama on the Iranian issue heightened, Israel’s influence on the course of the negotiations and its outcome lessened.” “The dilemma that Netanyahu faces today is not an easy one. He can push the leaders of the Republican majority in the two houses of Congress to try to torpedo the agreement,” Mr. Barnea said. “It is doubtful whether doing this would achieve its purpose.” But Emily Landau, an Iran expert at Israel’s , said Israel’s campaign in recent months had succeeded, at least, in preventing critics of the deal from being marginalized as “warmongers or idiots.” Ms. Landau was one of many in Israel who opposed Mr. Netanyahu’s speech in Congress last month against White House wishes, but she said that it helped reframe the debate in newspaper editorials and foreign policy institutes. “If you look at very serious analysts at the unofficial levels, you see them coming together with the same interpretations, whether they sit in America or France,” she said Friday. “It’s not just Israel is out of step with the international community — we’re past that. If the Obama administration tries to continue with that line, it’s getting old and stale. There’s a need to confront the serious and important criticism that a lot of knowledgeable people have.” For Ms. Landau, that criticism starts with how Iranian violations of the agreement would be detected, who would determine if such violations warranted confrontation and who would “take action if it’s deemed necessary to take action that goes beyond the sanctions.” The situation reminded Mr. Eiland, the former Israeli national security adviser, of an in which King David fasts for seven days after Batsheva bears him a very sick son. Once the baby dies, the king asks for something to eat, explaining, in the book of Samuel: “Why should I fast? I can’t bring him back to life.” Israel should say to the Americans, “We understand this is a fait accompli, it is something that cannot be reversed,” Mr. Eiland said. “Let’s try to solve other problems we have. Don’t push us to the corner in the Palestinian arena, make sure you’re not going to be against us in the U.N. Let’s try to improve what can be improved, let’s stop fighting because this specific game is over.” Advertisement
An Emerging Nuclear Deal With Iran	Advertisement Supported by Editorial By  Iran and the six major powers may be within reach of an agreement to limit Iran’s nuclear program. After months of little apparent progress, the suggests that negotiators in Geneva might be able to complete a framework by the end of March, with a final accord reached at the end of June. This isn’t certain, but it offers hope that the protracted nuclear threat from Iran can be resolved peacefully. If it comes together, any agreement would have to establish verifiable limits on the nuclear program and ensure that Iran cannot quickly produce enough weapons-usable material for a bomb. A pact would not end Iran’s nuclear program outright, which it says it needs for power generation and medical purposes, or erase the nuclear know-how Iran and its scientists have acquired over since an agreement between President Eisenhower and Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi for the United States to provide Iran with nuclear technology. Critics of any deal — including those in Congress, such as Senator Mark Kirk, a Republican of Illinois, and Senator Robert Menendez, a Democrat of New Jersey; and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel — demand complete dismantlement of Iran’s program given the country’s history of lying about its efforts to produce nuclear fuel and pursue other weapons-related activities. But their desired outcome simply cannot be achieved. President George W. Bush wasn’t able to secure that goal in 2003 when Iran had only a few dozen centrifuges, the machines that enrich uranium for nuclear fuel. Now, 12 years later, Iran has an estimated centrifuges, not to mention scores of other facilities, including some that have been hardened to withstand a military attack. Bombing Iran might delay the nuclear program for a couple of years but it wouldn’t eradicate it, and the blowback — provoking Iran to speed up production of a nuclear weapon, fueling regional tensions — would be severe. The United States and its partners (Britain, France, Russia, China and Germany) have properly focused in the negotiations on curbing Iran’s activities, especially uranium enrichment for weapon purposes. They are trying to structure the agreement so they would know at least a year in advance if Iran moved to speed up its program to build a nuclear bomb. That would allow plenty of time to re-impose sanctions, interrupt the program through cyberwarfare or take military action. During talks in Geneva this week, progress was reportedly made on the time frame of a deal. The idea is to establish a 10-year period in which Iran’s ability to produce nuclear fuel would be strictly limited, with restrictions eased gradually in the following five years. The lure for the Iranians is that reaching a deal would result in an easing of crippling economic sanctions that have been imposed by the United Nations and Western nations, and that after the deal runs its course they would be able to pursue nuclear enrichment for energy and medical purposes without constraints. Some Iranians had wanted to restrict the deal to seven years, while some Americans had wanted 15 years or longer. The central factor in any deal is how to limit Iran’s ability to enrich weapons-grade uranium, which means barring it from enriching uranium above the 5 percent grade for normal power reactors, reducing the number of operating centrifuges from 10,200, limiting the number of advanced centrifuges, and cutting the amount of low-enriched uranium stockpiled in Iran. Iran’s major nuclear installations are already monitored by the International Atomic Energy Agency and watched by the United States. But any agreement would also have to require Iran’s ratification of the international agency’s additional protocol, an agreement that allows for even more aggressive inspections to ensure materials are not diverted to a covert nuclear weapons program. The nuclear threat has dominated Iran’s relations with the United States for more than a decade. If this can be resolved, the two countries may be able to tackle other differences, including Iran’s missile program and its growing involvement in regional conflicts. It won’t be easy, but it could open up space for cooperation. Mr. Netanyahu, who is scheduled to address Congress next week, has already denounced the deal. The agreement must be judged on the complete package, not on any single provision. Even if the deal is not perfect, the greater risk could well be walking away and allowing Iran to continue its nuclear activities unfettered. Advertisement
Trump Can Make the Most of a Bad Iran Deal	Advertisement Supported by Op-Ed Contributor By  WASHINGTON — Secretary of State last month that United States policy toward Iran shouldn’t begin and end with the nuclear deal. Washington’s issues with that country are far wider, Mr. Tillerson said, citing Iran’s meddling in Syria and Iraq, and its support for terrorist groups like Hezbollah. The secretary of state is certainly right about that. But he elided an important point: Without a stable approach to the nuclear deal, questions about its fate will distract from and ultimately hobble broader American diplomacy on Iran and other crucial issues in the Middle East. President Trump — who campaigned on promises to tear up the nuclear deal — has indicated that in mid-October, when the next 90-day deadline for recertifying Iran’s compliance with the agreement arrives, he will find that Iran has violated it. This could lead to the deal’s collapse. But there seems to be in any significant way. The Iranians appear to be exploiting and trying to get away with what they can when it comes to the deal’s limits on certain nuclear activities like the production and storage of heavy water. Likewise, they seem to be levied by the United Nations but not actually included in the nuclear agreement itself. None of these appear to constitute a material breach of the agreement. The problem the United States faces is not Iranian compliance, but the very terms of the agreement. Mr. Trump isn’t wrong when he says it’s a “bad deal.” It’s too narrow in scope, permitting Iran to work on its missile and centrifuge technology even while uranium enrichment is paused. More worrying, it’s only temporary. Some of its strictures begin to phase out in less than a decade, during which time Tehran can expand its power in the Middle East, just as the United States’ tools for trying to keep it in check — in particular, sanctions — are limited. But like it or not, the clock is not so easily turned back. Any realistic Iran policy must take this as its starting point. Rather than ripping up the deal or simply acquiescing to it, the Trump administration should strengthen both the deal and the policy framework of which it is a part. Stability on the issue of the nuclear agreement will eliminate a distraction and create leverage to rally international support for a better Middle East strategy. That’s why the United States should work with allies to more strictly interpret the existing text of the accord. Along with Britain, France and Germany — sometimes known as the E.U.3 — the United States should close any loopholes being exploited by Iran, increase intelligence cooperation on Iran’s nuclear activities and push international inspectors to interpret their mandate more broadly. These allies should also agree to enforce United Nations rules that aren’t included in the agreement, like those strictly limiting Iran’s arms trade. Working with these same allies, the United States should also tackle issues omitted from the nuclear deal, like Iran’s missile program. Through a package of sanctions, export controls, interdictions and missile defense, they should aim to prevent Iran from acquiring an intercontinental ballistic missile and from continuing to export missile technology. The United States and the E.U.3 should also address the problem of the nuclear deal’s expiration date by jointly declaring now that they intend to expand and extend the agreement, rather than allow Iran’s nuclear activities to suddenly increase when it expires. In parallel, they should seek to strengthen global nonproliferation efforts so that even if nuclear restrictions specific to Iran cannot be extended, Tehran faces more challenges to weaponization when the deal does lapse. All of this must go hand in hand with a larger strategy to counter Iranian aggression in the Middle East. Iran’s leaders appear to be increasingly self-confident, perceiving success in , and . And Iran is steadily expanding its network of . To reverse these trends, the United States must move from generalities about countering Iran to specific aims — for example, preventing Iranian forces from entrenching in , or deterring the use of anti-ship cruise missiles in the Bab el Mandeb Strait off Yemen’s coast. American officials need to communicate these boundaries to Iran and back them up with a range of tools, including sanctions, diplomacy and limited military force if necessary. These measures require help from America’s allies, who are not eager to fiddle with the nuclear agreement or face up to the problem of Iran’s regional policies. This is where diplomacy comes in. Allies in Europe and elsewhere know the deal is controversial in Washington, and they take seriously Mr. Trump’s threats to stop honoring it. Policy makers in Washington should make clear that their allies’ cooperation with efforts to strengthen the deal and counter Iran are required to avoid that outcome. The United States cannot subordinate its entire policy toward Iran or the Middle East to the preservation of the nuclear accord. And it shouldn’t shoulder sole responsibility for addressing Iran’s threats while Europe enjoys the deal’s benefits. Even then, this would constitute only the start of a policy for addressing the challenge of Iran. Iran is adept at exploiting chaos, which is endemic in the Middle East. Washington will need sound approaches to the wars in Syria and Yemen, Iraq’s fragility and other regional challenges like the . But none of this will be possible if there is an international crisis every time there’s a new deadline for certifying compliance or waiving sanctions. Michael Singh ( ), a former senior director for Middle East affairs at the United States National Security Council, is the managing director of Washington Institute for Near East Policy.

None	A group of Senate Democrats who had been pushing for legislation to impose new sanctions on Iran said Tuesday that they would hold off on a vote until late March. The decision is a victory for President Obama, who has threatened to veto any such legislation while negotiations with Iran are underway. , the group of 10 senators, led by Senator Robert Menendez — who is an author of the bill — said they would hold off in acknowledgment of Mr. Obama’s concern about congressional action. The senators said that they would not vote for the Nuclear Weapon Free Iran Act of 2015 before March 24, the deadline that was set for Iran to make concessions to demonstrate that its nuclear program is peaceful. They also said that they would vote for the legislation only if Iran failed to reach an agreement on a political framework “that addresses all parameters of a comprehensive agreement.” Negotiating teams had set June 30 as a deadline for concluding talks on technicalities of a comprehensive deal. Despite promising to hold off on a vote, the senators expressed doubts about Iran’s intentions. “We remain deeply skeptical that Iran is committed to making the concessions required to demonstrate to the world that its nuclear program is exclusively peaceful by March 24 â the deadline agreed upon for a political framework agreement,” they wrote. “Considering Iranâs history in nuclear negotiations and after two extensions of the joint plan of action, we are concerned that Iran is intentionally extending the negotiations to improve its leverage at the negotiating table.” Here is David E. Sanger’s article in today’s Times about American and Iranian lawmakers who are looking to influence negotiations. By DAVID E. SANGER While the House of Representatives weighs whether to impose new sanctions on Tehran, the Iranian Parliament is working on a resolution of its own.

Iran’s Foreign Minister Warns of Unlimited Atomic Fuel Enrichment if Talks on Final Agreement Fail	Advertisement Supported by By  Iran’s foreign minister raised the prospect on Friday of unlimited Iranian atomic fuel enrichment if the final phase of talks with the United States and other big powers on Iran’s disputed nuclear program does not achieve an agreement by a June 30 deadline, with all sanctions dropped. The foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, also said the Americans had diverged from a on April 2 by publishing what they described as a fact sheet about the framework’s basic provisions. Contrary to that assertion, Mr. Zarif said, there would be no phased removal of sanctions to ensure Iranian compliance. American and Iranian officials are using different words to describe elements of the preliminary agreement to limit Iran’s nuclear program. “The United States for their own domestic reasons, and that’s their right and prerogative, produced a fact sheet, which was not exactly what we adopted,” Mr. Zarif . It was his first extensive interview with a Western news organization since the framework agreement was reached in Lausanne, Switzerland. Iran has been subjected to a litany of economic and financial sanctions over the years — from the United Nations Security Council, the United States and the European Union — over uranium enrichment and other nuclear activities. The framework agreement would curb those activities and provide guarantees that Iran’s nuclear program was peaceful in exchange for the removal of the sanctions, which have deeply hurt the Iranian economy. While Iranian officials have always asserted that their program is peaceful — and Mr. Zarif did so again in the Euronews interview — the language he used about a possible failure to reach a final agreement was unusually blunt. As Iran and world powers including the United States try to reach a deal on nuclear controls in exchange for the lifting of sanctions, Iranians from all walks of life are watching and hoping for a new start. “We’ve said from the beginning that we need to choose the path,” he said, speaking in English. “We can have the path of confrontation or we can have the path of cooperation. We cannot have a little bit of each. If we take the path of confrontation, the United States and the United Nations will continue with their sanctions, and Iran will continue with its enrichment program. Without any limitations.” Mr. Zarif’s interview was the second strong public pushback against the United States this week over the remaining challenges to resolving the nuclear dispute. On Wednesday, Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, worked out between the Obama administration and Congress that gave American lawmakers a greater voice on terms of a final deal. Iran, Mr. Rouhani said, was negotiating with a group of six countries — the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council plus Germany — not just the United States. Last week Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, who has the final word on Iran’s nuclear activities, said any final agreement must end all sanctions on the day that a pact is signed. video Advertisement
None	The best thing that can be said about the 98-1 on Thursday was that it did not make a flawed bill any worse. Republicans who are determined to sabotage the emerging nuclear agreement between Iran and the major powers wanted to pile on a number of problematic amendments but debate on them was precluded because of party infighting. The bill sets the procedures for Congress to review â and possibly vote on â the agreement, which would have Iran curb its nuclear program in return for a lifting of international sanctions. It would prohibit President Obama from waiving economic sanctions on Iran â the crucial element of any agreement under which Iran rolls back its nuclear program â for at least 30 days, and up to 52 days, after signing an agreement so Congress has time to weigh in. The legislation was the product of compromise among senators who are viscerally opposed to any deal with Iran and those who made an institutional argument that Congress must have a role in such an important agreement. The measure now goes to the House of Representatives, where passage is considered certain. In theory, the legislation creates new and potentially dangerous uncertainties for the nuclear agreement, which is supposed to be completed by June 30 and offers the best chance of restraining an Iranian program that had become a serious threat. But a letter sent to Mr. Obama by 150 House Democrats on Thursday was a welcome hint that Congress may not be able to kill a nuclear deal after all, no matter how hard the opponents are trying. In the letter, the lawmakers express strong support for the negotiations and the interim political framework that was announced last month. They urge Mr. Obama to âstay on courseâ towards a strong and verifiable final agreement and, taking implied aim at opponents who have raised the prospect of military action against Iran, declare that âwar itself will not make us safe.â The number and nature of the signatories is key, representing one-third of the members of the House and including Jewish members and Democratic leaders. That suggests there may be enough support in the House to prevent Congress from disapproving a final deal and from sustaining a disapproval vote over Mr. Obamaâs certain veto. The problem is that if Congress gets to the point of taking a vote of disapproval, that could cause Iran and the world to question Americaâs commitment to a final agreement, a potentially disastrous outcome if the deal is sound and verifiable.

Iran’s Leaders Fall Into Line Behind Nuclear Accord	Advertisement Supported by By  TEHRAN — Since the Islamic Revolution in 1979, Iranian hard-liners have been free to take to the streets and object to any form of compromise with the West, and particularly the United States. But when a conspicuously small group of hard-liners did so on Tuesday morning in front of the Parliament building, holding up placards and shouting slogans against the nuclear framework agreed to last week in Lausanne, Switzerland, the Iranian Interior Ministry condemned the demonstration as illegal, because the protesters had failed to obtain a permit. There were also very few reporters. It was perhaps the first time that conservatives — in this case mostly young people genuinely disappointed over the compromises has made to reach a nuclear agreement — seemed disconnected from the power structure here. Analysts say the message from the top is clear: Get with the program. Senior officials, important clerics, lawmakers and Revolutionary Guards commanders, who in the past have reflexively opposed any accommodation with the West, now go out of their way to laud Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and his team of negotiators, as well as the government of President Hassan Rouhani. On Tuesday, Gen. Mohammad Ali Jafari, the highest-ranking commander of the Corps, joined the chorus. “The Iranian nation and the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps thank these dear negotiators for their honest attempts and political jihad, and for their resistance on the defined red lines,” the semiofficial Mehr news agency quoted him as saying. One influential cleric even issued a statement to correct a quote attributed to him that suggested he had been slightly critical of the nuclear framework. “Unfortunately, these remarks are lies attributed to him,” the office of Ayatollah Naser Marakem Shirazi hastily made clear. American and Iranian officials are using different words to describe elements of the preliminary agreement to limit Iran’s nuclear program. Only one man had remained silent: Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader, whose word is always the last. However, analysts say the broad support among conservatives is almost certainly a reflection of his thinking. Hamidreza Taraghi, a political analyst close to Ayatollah Khamenei, said it should not be surprising that Iran’s establishment had closed ranks behind the negotiators and the talks. “Wherever Foreign Minister Zarif goes to explain about the negotiations, his arguments are convincing and accepted,” he said. “Of course, we worry about some details, but they will be hammered out and solved, we are sure.” On Tuesday, Mr. Zarif earned glowing praise after he paid a visit to Parliament to describe the nuclear framework and answer lawmakers’ questions. Outside were the 150 or so hard-line demonstrators. “We are the voice of the people,” one of the protesters said. “We are worried over this deal.” But some people passing by had different ideas. “Go home,” someone yelled from a car window. “Drink the chalice of poison,” another shouted, a reference to a remark by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the former leader of Iran, describing his bitter feelings upon signing a cease-fire after eight bloody years of war with Iraq. “The people can swear at us,” said Vahid Aziz, an engineering student who held up a placard saying “We Are Worried.” They can swear, he said, because Iran is a democracy. “We also have the right to say something.” A guide to help you navigate the deal between global powers and Tehran. But their opinion seems to be a minority one. In a poll conducted by the pro-government IRNA news agency, 96 percent of people in Tehran were found to support the nuclear deal. Opinion polls in Iran are notoriously unreliable, but the news agency insisted that 83 percent of the respondents “expressed happiness, hope and relief on hearing about the nuclear agreement achieved in Lausanne, Switzerland.” For those who have long lived under the enforced opinions of minority groups, like Nader Karimi Joni, a former member of the paramilitary Basij organization who is now an activist and journalist, the progress in the nuclear talks is a vindication. “These people protesting the deal are a small, doomed group of losers who do not understand that the perceptions of the establishment have changed,” he said. “They can shout ‘Death to America’ all they want, but nobody in the government or in the establishment is in the mood for these sorts of actions.” Iran’s interior minister, Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli, issued a warning that henceforth no illegal gatherings would be allowed. “Those who are ‘worried’ or ‘not-worried,’ they all need a permit to protest so we can guarantee their security,” he told the Arman newspaper. But one of the organizers of the gathering, a 26-year-old student named Ali Mataji, said protest was necessary, “because we have the right to ask questions.” He added: “We will not stop, as there is a deviation of the national interests in the nuclear issue.” Outside the Parliament building, a passer-by started a discussion with Mr. Aziz, the engineering student. “Why don’t you wait with your criticism until the deal is more clear?” the man asked. “We need to bring awareness,” Mr. Aziz responded, waving his placard. The man shook his head, telling the protester, “Your actions are weakening the talks.” Advertisement
Fates of 3 Americans Held in Iran Remain Hazy Despite Diplomatic Progress	Advertisement Supported by By  The families of three American citizens of Iranian descent who are incarcerated in Iran, one of them held for more than three and a half years, have been hoping that the success of diplomacy on the nuclear dispute would herald their releases as good-will gestures. But the fates of the three — Jason Rezaian, 39, Saeed Abedini, 34, and Amir Hekmati, 31 — remained just as hazy as they had ever been on Friday, a day after the framework agreement was reached. They were barely mentioned in the initial flurry of news announcements on the framework agreement which, when finalized, would limit Iran’s nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief, and portend an end to the country’s prolonged isolation. Secretary of State John Kerry, after the announcement of an agreement at talks in Lausanne, Switzerland, was asked about the three Americans almost immediately and offered little in the way of an update except to reiterate the Obama administration’s determination to secure their freedom. “We have a very specific process in place to try to deal with it,” Mr. Kerry said. “And we call on Iran again today, now, in light of this, to release these Americans and let them get home with their families. And we’re working on that, and we will continue to be very focused on it.” Families of the three Americans, who have become increasingly vocal to raise public awareness, expressed appreciation of Mr. Kerry’s statement. But they could barely hide their frustration and disappointment. The family of Mr. Rezaian, a Washington Post correspondent and California native who has been imprisoned without publicly revealed charges since July 20, issued a challenging Iranian officials to follow their own laws and international human rights commitments. “Jason has been held more than twice as long as any prior Western journalist, and with no evidence that Iran is willing to claim justifies their actions,” said Mr. Rezaian’s brother Ali. “All Iran has said is that ‘it’s complicated.’ Now that a framework agreement has been announced, things should be less ‘complicated.’ ” Mr. Hekmati, a Marine veteran from Flint, Mich., who was arrested while visiting relatives in August 2011, was originally sentenced to death on an espionage conviction that was later overturned. He was convicted of the lesser charge of aiding a hostile country — meaning the United States — and sentenced to 10 years. He has repeatedly asserted his innocence, accused the Iranian penal authorities of mistreatment and described himself as a political prisoner. “Now that Iran has sat at the table next to the United States, working diligently to come to an agreement for a nuclear program, we ask Iran if they still consider the United States a hostile country and if they do not, perhaps it is time they open the prison gates and allow the Red Cross to visit Amir without guard and report on the status of his well-being,” his family in a statement. Mr. Abedini, of Boise, Idaho, was sentenced in 2013 to eight years in prison on charges of disturbing national security by creating a private network of churches. The American Center for Law and Justice, an advocacy group that represents his family, that with the achievement of a framework nuclear deal, “it is critical that our government use this unique opportunity — as our two nations continue to sit at the negotiating table over the next few weeks and months — to bring Pastor Saeed and the other wrongfully imprisoned Americans home to their families.” Advertisement
European Leaders Criticize Trump’s Disavowal of Iran Deal	Advertisement Supported by By  and LONDON — Iran, Russia and European leaders roundly condemned President Trump’s decision on Friday to disavow the , saying that it reflected the growing isolation of the United States, threatened to destabilize the Middle East and could make it harder to resolve the growing tensions on the Korean Peninsula. The reaction was far from panicked, as Mr. Trump’s decision punts to Congress the critical decision of whether the United States will reimpose sanctions on Iran — a step that would effectively sink the deal. But Mr. Trump also warned that unless the nuclear agreement was altered and made permanent — to prohibit Iran from ever developing nuclear weapons — he would terminate the agreement, an ultimatum that threw the future of the accord into question. Though they avoided direct criticism of Mr. Trump, Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Emmanuel Macron of France said in a rare joint statement that they “stand committed” to the 2015 nuclear deal and that preserving it was “in our shared national security interest.” “The nuclear deal was the culmination of 13 years of diplomacy and was a major step towards ensuring that Iran’s nuclear program is not diverted for military purposes,” they added. Sigmar Gabriel, Germany’s foreign minister, said that Mr. Trump was sending “a difficult and also from our point of view dangerous signal.” He said that the Iran deal, and other diplomatic achievements, were necessary “to convince countries like North Korea, and maybe also others, that it is possible to create security without acquiring nuclear weapons.” “Destroying this agreement would, worldwide, mean that others could no longer rely on such agreements — that’s why it is a danger that goes further than Iran,” he added. Reaction from Iran was quick and pointed. Appearing on television, its president, Hassan Rouhani, denounced Mr. Trump and called the United States an outlier that had become “more lonely than ever” in the international community. Mr. Rouhani did not threaten to withdraw from the deal, but made it clear that he would not renegotiate the terms, either. “The statements of Mr. Trump are nothing but abuse and threats against the people of Iran,” he said. “An international agreement cannot be disregarded.” The European leaders noted that the United Nations Security Council had unanimously endorsed the deal, and that the International Atomic Energy Agency had confirmed Iran’s compliance with it. But Mr. Trump’s aggressive stance on Iran won plaudits from several nations on Friday, specifically from adversaries of Iran like Israel, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister who has always opposed the agreement with Iran, said that Mr. Trump’s announcement created “an opportunity to fix this bad deal” and was a sign of Mr. Trump’s determination to “boldly confront Iran’s terrorist regime.” Saudi Arabia, which has waged a proxy battle against Iran for supremacy in the region and was the first country Mr. Trump visited after taking office, said it welcomed what it called a “new U.S. strategy” toward Iran. The United Arab Emirates, which like Saudi Arabia is a predominantly Sunni Muslim country with a sizable Shiite minority, also said that it “fully supports” Mr. Trump’s stance on Iran. Some leaders declared that the deal, reached in 2015 between Iran and six world powers, including the United States, was not something that Mr. Trump could cancel, contending that Mr. Trump was essentially putting on a show for his political base. “The president of the United States has many powers — not this one,” the European Union’s top diplomat, Federica Mogherini, said at a news conference in Brussels. She said that there had been no violations of the agreement and that the world could not afford to dismantle an accord that “is working and delivering,” especially at a time of “acute nuclear threat,” referring to the standoff with North Korea over its nuclear program. Criticism of the nuclear deal was a central theme of Mr. Trump’s candidacy for president, and he has repeatedly called for what he sees as a fatally flawed agreement. Mr. Trump said on Friday that under the current deal “Iran can sprint” toward the development of nuclear weapons when the deal’s restrictions expire. Some of the prohibitions in the agreement are set to end in 2025, including limits on the number of its centrifuges. Iran, which has always maintained that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, not for weapons, would not agree to a permanent freeze in its ability to enrich nuclear fuel. That must be changed, Mr. Trump said, or he would scrap the deal altogether. Russia, which took part in the negotiations to reach the accord and has warned Mr. Trump not to rescind it, said that the president had no basis for disavowing the deal. “Iran is abiding” by the nuclear agreement, Mikhail Ulyanov, a director at the Russian foreign ministry, told the Interfax news agency. “Everyone agrees with that. And an attempt to somehow heighten the tensions in this situation looks like unmotivated aggression.” In blunt language, Ms. Mogherini, the European Union’s top diplomat, essentially looked past Mr. Trump and appealed to Congress directly. America’s next step “is now in the hands of the United States Congress,” she said. “The international community and the European Union with it has clearly indicated that the deal is and will continue to be in place.” Russia urged American lawmakers to preserve the deal as well. “We want to hope that Congress will not take any dramatic steps which would effectively signify a collapse” of the deal, Russia’s deputy foreign minister told Interfax, referring to the renewed sanctions that might lead Iran to nullify the accord. In his remarks, Mr. Trump accused Iran of violating both the letter and the spirit of the accord. But Iran has accused the United States of doing the same, and on Friday its mission to the United Nations warned that Iran might itself back away from the deal. “Iran has many options on how to proceed and if necessary will terminate its commitment regarding this issue,” the mission said in a statement, without elaborating. Iran has also resisted the idea of renegotiating the nuclear agreement in the West’s favor. Last month, its foreign minister rejected extending the length or conditions of the accord, saying that Iran would consider changing the agreement only if the concessions it had already made — including giving up nuclear fuel — were reconsidered. There are fears that the basic framework of the accord could collapse if the United States walks away. Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, told reporters on Friday that Russia believed Iran would abandon the deal if the United States did. Stephen Castle reported from London, and Thomas Erdbrink from Dallas. Reporting was contributed by Victor Homola from Berlin, Sophia Kishkovsky from Moscow and Daphné Anglès and Liam Stack from Paris. Opinion Opinion Advertisement
Mr. Obama, Try These Arguments for Your Iran Deal	Advertisement Supported by By  It would be a catastrophe for American influence in the world if Congress killed the Iranian nuclear deal. Perhaps because the stakes are so high, the debate has become poisonous. Critics are (ludicrously) of appealing to anti-Semitic tropes. And Obama that some opponents were “alarmist,” “ignorant,” “not being straight” and “making common cause” with Iranians who chant “Death to America.” Obama’s rhetoric was counterproductive. As former Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Texas Republican, told me, “At this point, the president has made it impossible for a Republican to vote for it.” Constituent calls to congressional offices are overwhelmingly against the deal, and with Senator Chuck Schumer by opposing it, the opposition is more bipartisan than the support is. That’s tragic, for killing the deal would infuriate many allies, isolate America rather than Iran and ultimately increase the risk of ayatollahs with nuclear weapons. why I’m strongly in favor of the deal, and I urge President Obama to start over with his sales job and focus on three points. The great majority of arms experts support the deal, some enthusiastically, some grudgingly. They recognize shortcomings, but on balance, as 29 of America’s leading nuclear scientists and arms experts last week, it has “much more stringent constraints than any previously negotiated nonproliferation framework.” Likewise, three dozen retired American released declaring the deal “the most effective means currently available to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons.” Iran would go from maybe a few months from a bomb to a year away. The agreement doesn’t solve the underlying problem, but it may buy us 15 years. Yes, it would be nice if Iran gave up all its enriched uranium. But isn’t it better that it than that it give up none? Everyone knows Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel , but not everyone realizes other Israelis with far more security expertise support it. Ami Ayalon, former head of Israel’s Shin Bet security service, as “the best possible alternative.” And Efraim Halevy, former head of the Mossad, , “What is the point of canceling an agreement that distances Iran from the bomb?” Critics sometimes note that President Bill Clinton reached an agreement on nuclear weapons with North Korea in 1994, only to see North Korea cheat. The lesson they draw is that it’s pointless to negotiate with untrustworthy rogue regimes. I’ve covered North Korea since I was a young reporter in Asia in the 1980s, and the lesson is actually more like the opposite. That 1994 agreement was indeed flawed, and North Korea violated it. But even so, in the was in place, North Korea , according to American intelligence estimates. After the deal collapsed in 2002, the Bush administration turned to a policy of confrontation, and North Korea then made perhaps nine nuclear weapons. I asked David Petraeus, retired four-star general and former head of the C.I.A., about that. “I strongly believe,” he told me, “that there will continue to be a viable military option should Iran seek to break out and construct a nuclear device after the expiration of many of the elements of the inspections regime at the 15-year mark of the agreement.” To me, this deal is ugly and flawed — and infinitely better than the alternatives. The criticisms of the deal strike me as reasonable, but the alternatives that the critics propose seem unreasonable and incoherent. So President Obama should hit the restart button. He should acknowledge that the deal has shortcomings but also emphasize that it must be judged not by a referendum on its terms but rather as a choice: deal or no deal. He can also take steps to reassure doubters. We could boost funding for the International Atomic Energy Agency to make oversight more effective. We could do more to speak up for human rights in Iran and to counter Iranian meddling in the region, especially in Syria. Gen. Brent Scowcroft, the patriarch of Republican security experts, tells me that he supports the Iran deal in part because it exemplifies American leadership on a crucial global issue. I agree, and for Congress to kill it will not just set back American leadership, it will also increase the odds that Iran gets the bomb. Gail Collins is on book leave.

Skeptical of Iran Nuclear Deal, Israel Calls for Changes	Advertisement Supported by By  and JERUSALEM — Clearly unsatisfied with assurances from President Obama about the provisions of the nuclear deal, on Monday listed specific requirements that it declared were necessary in any final agreement. The list, produced by Yuval Steinitz, Israel’s minister of intelligence and strategic affairs and one of the Israeli government’s harshest critics of the negotiations, marked a change in direction for the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Until now, Israel has argued, at least publicly, that the only good deal would halt all uranium enrichment by Iran, essentially rolling back the clock by 20 years. It has never before defined the “better deal” that Mr. Netanyahu told Congress the world needed. But Mr. Steinitz’s list of desired modifications for the final agreement, due to be concluded by June 30, appeared carefully designed to echo some of the more sophisticated critiques of the agreement that have circulated since the United States described critical elements of the deal on Thursday. Israeli policy makers have grappled for some time with the question of whether to stick, at least publicly, to Israel’s maximalist demands, even though they appeared increasingly out of sync with the reality of a negotiation that clearly was going to require concessions on all sides. American and Iranian officials are using different words to describe elements of the preliminary agreement to limit Iran’s nuclear program. Before the details of the framework were made known, some Israeli officials feared that showing any flexibility might be interpreted as a green light by the Obama administration to engage in further give and take, precluding a more nuanced approach. Mr. Steinitz’s tone was a bit different, saying the changes — including some restraints American negotiators had attempted unsuccessfully to obtain in past negotiations — would make the accord “more reasonable.” But the Obama administration fears that reopening the issues with Iran in the last stages of the talks would invite it to do the same, rapidly unraveling the deal. So far, the administration has shown no inclination to relitigate some of the most contentious issues that have been argued over for the last two years, culminating in eight days of intense negotiation at a hotel in Lausanne, Switzerland, on the banks of Lake Geneva. But Mr. Steinitz said that the suggestion that there was no alternative to the framework, or that Israel had not put forward an alternative, “is wrong.” “The alternative is not necessarily to declare war on Iran,” he said, briefing international reporters at a Jerusalem hotel. “It is to increase pressure on Iran and stand firm and make Iran make serious concessions and have a much better deal.” The Lausanne framework calls on Iran to limit enrichment of uranium at its Natanz facility to a level useful only for civilian purposes, drastically cut its fuel stockpile and cut back the number of installed centrifuges by about two-thirds. It would convert the underground Fordo facility into a research center, but would be barred from enriching there. Iran would also modify its Arak heavy water reactor to drastically reduce its output of plutonium, another path to a bomb. In exchange, the United States and other nations would lift sanctions that have constrained the Iranian economy. President Obama said the sanctions would be lifted only after Iran had delivered on its commitments regarding Fordo, the centrifuges and other issues, although he said there were details still to be worked out. The Israeli list of additions to the framework includes the following:  An end to all research and development activity on advanced centrifuges in Iran. The Lausanne framework, as described by the United States, leaves unclear what kind of work Iran will conduct. But it is a worry to American and Israeli officials because Iran will be readying to deploy the much more efficient centrifuges as soon as the major limitations on uranium production end, in 2030.  A significant reduction in the number of centrifuges that are operational or that can quickly become operational if Iran breaks the agreement and decides to build a bomb. The accord allows about 5,000 to operate for the first decade at the main plant at Natanz, roughly half the number spinning today.  The closing of the as an enrichment site, even if enrichment activities are suspended there. This was also an early United States objective. The compromise struck allows a small number of centrifuges to spin but bars the enrichment of uranium there; instead, other elements will be created for medical isotopes.  Iranian compliance in revealing its past activities with “possible military dimensions.” It is unclear from the wording of the American statement if Iran must completely answer a dozen questions posed by the International Atomic Energy Agency — 11 of which it has declined to answer so far — before it would receive full sanctions relief.  A commitment to ship its stockpile of enriched uranium out of Iran. Iran said last week that it would not ship the stockpile out of the country, but the American statement left open the possibility of sending it abroad or diluting it in Iran.  “Anywhere, anytime” access for inspectors charged with verifying the agreement in Iran. The inspection regime falls short of this, but sets up some kind of mechanism — the details of which are unclear — to resolve disputes if Iran blocks inspection of a suspected site. The reaction from Israel came after that the preliminary agreement was the “best bet by far” to prevent Tehran from obtaining a nuclear weapon and his pledge to the Israelis that the United States had “got their backs.” The disagreements between Israel and the Obama administration over the Iran talks have severely strained the American-Israeli relationship in recent months, with the . The White House was infuriated by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s decision to address a joint meeting of Congress in March without consulting the White House. Despite Mr. Obama’s more conciliatory tone toward Israel in recent days, Israel has made it clear that it intends to keep up the pressure. On Sunday, Mr. Netanyahu appeared on ABC’s “This Week,” CNN’s “State of the Union” and NBC News’s “Meet the Press,” where he said: “I’m not trying to kill any deal. I’m trying to kill a bad deal.” Yet Israel’s former intelligence chiefs have been more welcoming. Efraim Halevy, a former head of Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency, suggested that those in Israel who have been critical of Mr. Obama should change their tone. Mr. Halevy told Israel’s Army Radio on Monday that “in order to influence you have to act with a certain kind of respect for your partner.” Adel al-Jubeir, Saudi Arabia’s ambassador in Washington, echoed the Saudi cabinet of ministers in expressing hope that the final deal in June would prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. A guide to help you navigate the deal between global powers and Tehran. He would not say whether the agreement announced by the United States last week had gone far enough toward meeting that goal. “I don’t know because the details have not been worked out.” he said. “There are a number of areas where, I think, more clarification needs to take place.” On Monday in Jerusalem, Mr. Steinitz, the minister of intelligence and strategic affairs, said Israel would be making further efforts to persuade the Obama administration and Congress, as well as Britain, France, Russia and other world powers, “not to sign this bad deal or at least to dramatically change or fix it.” Referring to , a New York Times columnist, Mr. Steinitz said it was “not good enough.” It was unsatisfactory, Mr. Steinitz said, because of the time required to refer suspicions to a committee, and because no nation would want to expose sensitive intelligence data to a committee that included an Iranian presence. But Mr. Steinitz said the Israeli government had conducted a “sober analysis” of the agreement and was raising questions, including why the framework does not address Iran’s intercontinental ballistic missile program, which it says threatens the United States. The negotiation has never included Iran’s missile capability. As Mr. Steinitz was outlining his government’s position, the White House said it was actively seeking out supporters of Israel in its intensive effort to build support for the agreement. “This is a deliberate attempt to make the case to individuals who are concerned about the security of Israel that going along with an agreement like this that would prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon isn’t just in the best national security interests of the United States, which it is, it’s also clearly in the best interests of the nation of Israel,” said Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary. “That will be an important part of our case moving forward.” Isabel Kershner reported from Jerusalem, and David E.

Trump Can Make the Most of a Bad Iran Deal	Advertisement Supported by Op-Ed Contributor By  WASHINGTON — Secretary of State last month that United States policy toward Iran shouldn’t begin and end with the nuclear deal. Washington’s issues with that country are far wider, Mr. Tillerson said, citing Iran’s meddling in Syria and Iraq, and its support for terrorist groups like Hezbollah. The secretary of state is certainly right about that. But he elided an important point: Without a stable approach to the nuclear deal, questions about its fate will distract from and ultimately hobble broader American diplomacy on Iran and other crucial issues in the Middle East. President Trump — who campaigned on promises to tear up the nuclear deal — has indicated that in mid-October, when the next 90-day deadline for recertifying Iran’s compliance with the agreement arrives, he will find that Iran has violated it. This could lead to the deal’s collapse. But there seems to be in any significant way. The Iranians appear to be exploiting and trying to get away with what they can when it comes to the deal’s limits on certain nuclear activities like the production and storage of heavy water. Likewise, they seem to be levied by the United Nations but not actually included in the nuclear agreement itself. None of these appear to constitute a material breach of the agreement. The problem the United States faces is not Iranian compliance, but the very terms of the agreement. Mr. Trump isn’t wrong when he says it’s a “bad deal.” It’s too narrow in scope, permitting Iran to work on its missile and centrifuge technology even while uranium enrichment is paused. More worrying, it’s only temporary. Some of its strictures begin to phase out in less than a decade, during which time Tehran can expand its power in the Middle East, just as the United States’ tools for trying to keep it in check — in particular, sanctions — are limited. But like it or not, the clock is not so easily turned back. Any realistic Iran policy must take this as its starting point. Rather than ripping up the deal or simply acquiescing to it, the Trump administration should strengthen both the deal and the policy framework of which it is a part. Stability on the issue of the nuclear agreement will eliminate a distraction and create leverage to rally international support for a better Middle East strategy. That’s why the United States should work with allies to more strictly interpret the existing text of the accord. Along with Britain, France and Germany — sometimes known as the E.U.3 — the United States should close any loopholes being exploited by Iran, increase intelligence cooperation on Iran’s nuclear activities and push international inspectors to interpret their mandate more broadly. These allies should also agree to enforce United Nations rules that aren’t included in the agreement, like those strictly limiting Iran’s arms trade. Working with these same allies, the United States should also tackle issues omitted from the nuclear deal, like Iran’s missile program. Through a package of sanctions, export controls, interdictions and missile defense, they should aim to prevent Iran from acquiring an intercontinental ballistic missile and from continuing to export missile technology. The United States and the E.U.3 should also address the problem of the nuclear deal’s expiration date by jointly declaring now that they intend to expand and extend the agreement, rather than allow Iran’s nuclear activities to suddenly increase when it expires. In parallel, they should seek to strengthen global nonproliferation efforts so that even if nuclear restrictions specific to Iran cannot be extended, Tehran faces more challenges to weaponization when the deal does lapse. All of this must go hand in hand with a larger strategy to counter Iranian aggression in the Middle East. Iran’s leaders appear to be increasingly self-confident, perceiving success in , and . And Iran is steadily expanding its network of . To reverse these trends, the United States must move from generalities about countering Iran to specific aims — for example, preventing Iranian forces from entrenching in , or deterring the use of anti-ship cruise missiles in the Bab el Mandeb Strait off Yemen’s coast. American officials need to communicate these boundaries to Iran and back them up with a range of tools, including sanctions, diplomacy and limited military force if necessary. These measures require help from America’s allies, who are not eager to fiddle with the nuclear agreement or face up to the problem of Iran’s regional policies. This is where diplomacy comes in. Allies in Europe and elsewhere know the deal is controversial in Washington, and they take seriously Mr. Trump’s threats to stop honoring it. Policy makers in Washington should make clear that their allies’ cooperation with efforts to strengthen the deal and counter Iran are required to avoid that outcome. The United States cannot subordinate its entire policy toward Iran or the Middle East to the preservation of the nuclear accord. And it shouldn’t shoulder sole responsibility for addressing Iran’s threats while Europe enjoys the deal’s benefits. Even then, this would constitute only the start of a policy for addressing the challenge of Iran. Iran is adept at exploiting chaos, which is endemic in the Middle East. Washington will need sound approaches to the wars in Syria and Yemen, Iraq’s fragility and other regional challenges like the . But none of this will be possible if there is an international crisis every time there’s a new deadline for certifying compliance or waiving sanctions. Michael Singh ( ), a former senior director for Middle East affairs at the United States National Security Council, is the managing director of Washington Institute for Near East Policy.

None	A group of Senate Democrats who had been pushing for legislation to impose new sanctions on Iran said Tuesday that they would hold off on a vote until late March. The decision is a victory for President Obama, who has threatened to veto any such legislation while negotiations with Iran are underway. , the group of 10 senators, led by Senator Robert Menendez — who is an author of the bill — said they would hold off in acknowledgment of Mr. Obama’s concern about congressional action. The senators said that they would not vote for the Nuclear Weapon Free Iran Act of 2015 before March 24, the deadline that was set for Iran to make concessions to demonstrate that its nuclear program is peaceful. They also said that they would vote for the legislation only if Iran failed to reach an agreement on a political framework “that addresses all parameters of a comprehensive agreement.” Negotiating teams had set June 30 as a deadline for concluding talks on technicalities of a comprehensive deal. Despite promising to hold off on a vote, the senators expressed doubts about Iran’s intentions. “We remain deeply skeptical that Iran is committed to making the concessions required to demonstrate to the world that its nuclear program is exclusively peaceful by March 24 â the deadline agreed upon for a political framework agreement,” they wrote. “Considering Iranâs history in nuclear negotiations and after two extensions of the joint plan of action, we are concerned that Iran is intentionally extending the negotiations to improve its leverage at the negotiating table.” Here is David E. Sanger’s article in today’s Times about American and Iranian lawmakers who are looking to influence negotiations. By DAVID E.

Iran’s Foreign Minister Warns of Unlimited Atomic Fuel Enrichment if Talks on Final Agreement Fail	Advertisement Supported by By  Iran’s foreign minister raised the prospect on Friday of unlimited Iranian atomic fuel enrichment if the final phase of talks with the United States and other big powers on Iran’s disputed nuclear program does not achieve an agreement by a June 30 deadline, with all sanctions dropped. The foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, also said the Americans had diverged from a on April 2 by publishing what they described as a fact sheet about the framework’s basic provisions. Contrary to that assertion, Mr. Zarif said, there would be no phased removal of sanctions to ensure Iranian compliance. American and Iranian officials are using different words to describe elements of the preliminary agreement to limit Iran’s nuclear program. “The United States for their own domestic reasons, and that’s their right and prerogative, produced a fact sheet, which was not exactly what we adopted,” Mr. Zarif . It was his first extensive interview with a Western news organization since the framework agreement was reached in Lausanne, Switzerland. Iran has been subjected to a litany of economic and financial sanctions over the years — from the United Nations Security Council, the United States and the European Union — over uranium enrichment and other nuclear activities. The framework agreement would curb those activities and provide guarantees that Iran’s nuclear program was peaceful in exchange for the removal of the sanctions, which have deeply hurt the Iranian economy. While Iranian officials have always asserted that their program is peaceful — and Mr. Zarif did so again in the Euronews interview — the language he used about a possible failure to reach a final agreement was unusually blunt. As Iran and world powers including the United States try to reach a deal on nuclear controls in exchange for the lifting of sanctions, Iranians from all walks of life are watching and hoping for a new start. “We’ve said from the beginning that we need to choose the path,” he said, speaking in English. “We can have the path of confrontation or we can have the path of cooperation. We cannot have a little bit of each. If we take the path of confrontation, the United States and the United Nations will continue with their sanctions, and Iran will continue with its enrichment program. Without any limitations.” Mr. Zarif’s interview was the second strong public pushback against the United States this week over the remaining challenges to resolving the nuclear dispute. On Wednesday, Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, worked out between the Obama administration and Congress that gave American lawmakers a greater voice on terms of a final deal. Iran, Mr. Rouhani said, was negotiating with a group of six countries — the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council plus Germany — not just the United States. Last week Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, who has the final word on Iran’s nuclear activities, said any final agreement must end all sanctions on the day that a pact is signed. video Advertisement
None	The best thing that can be said about the 98-1 on Thursday was that it did not make a flawed bill any worse. Republicans who are determined to sabotage the emerging nuclear agreement between Iran and the major powers wanted to pile on a number of problematic amendments but debate on them was precluded because of party infighting. The bill sets the procedures for Congress to review â and possibly vote on â the agreement, which would have Iran curb its nuclear program in return for a lifting of international sanctions. It would prohibit President Obama from waiving economic sanctions on Iran â the crucial element of any agreement under which Iran rolls back its nuclear program â for at least 30 days, and up to 52 days, after signing an agreement so Congress has time to weigh in. The legislation was the product of compromise among senators who are viscerally opposed to any deal with Iran and those who made an institutional argument that Congress must have a role in such an important agreement. The measure now goes to the House of Representatives, where passage is considered certain. In theory, the legislation creates new and potentially dangerous uncertainties for the nuclear agreement, which is supposed to be completed by June 30 and offers the best chance of restraining an Iranian program that had become a serious threat. But a letter sent to Mr. Obama by 150 House Democrats on Thursday was a welcome hint that Congress may not be able to kill a nuclear deal after all, no matter how hard the opponents are trying. In the letter, the lawmakers express strong support for the negotiations and the interim political framework that was announced last month. They urge Mr. Obama to âstay on courseâ towards a strong and verifiable final agreement and, taking implied aim at opponents who have raised the prospect of military action against Iran, declare that âwar itself will not make us safe.â The number and nature of the signatories is key, representing one-third of the members of the House and including Jewish members and Democratic leaders. That suggests there may be enough support in the House to prevent Congress from disapproving a final deal and from sustaining a disapproval vote over Mr. Obamaâs certain veto. The problem is that if Congress gets to the point of taking a vote of disapproval, that could cause Iran and the world to question Americaâs commitment to a final agreement, a potentially disastrous outcome if the deal is sound and verifiable.

Iran’s Leaders Fall Into Line Behind Nuclear Accord	Advertisement Supported by By  TEHRAN — Since the Islamic Revolution in 1979, Iranian hard-liners have been free to take to the streets and object to any form of compromise with the West, and particularly the United States. But when a conspicuously small group of hard-liners did so on Tuesday morning in front of the Parliament building, holding up placards and shouting slogans against the nuclear framework agreed to last week in Lausanne, Switzerland, the Iranian Interior Ministry condemned the demonstration as illegal, because the protesters had failed to obtain a permit. There were also very few reporters. It was perhaps the first time that conservatives — in this case mostly young people genuinely disappointed over the compromises has made to reach a nuclear agreement — seemed disconnected from the power structure here. Analysts say the message from the top is clear: Get with the program. Senior officials, important clerics, lawmakers and Revolutionary Guards commanders, who in the past have reflexively opposed any accommodation with the West, now go out of their way to laud Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and his team of negotiators, as well as the government of President Hassan Rouhani. On Tuesday, Gen. Mohammad Ali Jafari, the highest-ranking commander of the Corps, joined the chorus. “The Iranian nation and the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps thank these dear negotiators for their honest attempts and political jihad, and for their resistance on the defined red lines,” the semiofficial Mehr news agency quoted him as saying. One influential cleric even issued a statement to correct a quote attributed to him that suggested he had been slightly critical of the nuclear framework. “Unfortunately, these remarks are lies attributed to him,” the office of Ayatollah Naser Marakem Shirazi hastily made clear. American and Iranian officials are using different words to describe elements of the preliminary agreement to limit Iran’s nuclear program. Only one man had remained silent: Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader, whose word is always the last. However, analysts say the broad support among conservatives is almost certainly a reflection of his thinking. Hamidreza Taraghi, a political analyst close to Ayatollah Khamenei, said it should not be surprising that Iran’s establishment had closed ranks behind the negotiators and the talks. “Wherever Foreign Minister Zarif goes to explain about the negotiations, his arguments are convincing and accepted,” he said. “Of course, we worry about some details, but they will be hammered out and solved, we are sure.” On Tuesday, Mr. Zarif earned glowing praise after he paid a visit to Parliament to describe the nuclear framework and answer lawmakers’ questions. Outside were the 150 or so hard-line demonstrators. “We are the voice of the people,” one of the protesters said. “We are worried over this deal.” But some people passing by had different ideas. “Go home,” someone yelled from a car window. “Drink the chalice of poison,” another shouted, a reference to a remark by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the former leader of Iran, describing his bitter feelings upon signing a cease-fire after eight bloody years of war with Iraq. “The people can swear at us,” said Vahid Aziz, an engineering student who held up a placard saying “We Are Worried.” They can swear, he said, because Iran is a democracy. “We also have the right to say something.” A guide to help you navigate the deal between global powers and Tehran. But their opinion seems to be a minority one. In a poll conducted by the pro-government IRNA news agency, 96 percent of people in Tehran were found to support the nuclear deal. Opinion polls in Iran are notoriously unreliable, but the news agency insisted that 83 percent of the respondents “expressed happiness, hope and relief on hearing about the nuclear agreement achieved in Lausanne, Switzerland.” For those who have long lived under the enforced opinions of minority groups, like Nader Karimi Joni, a former member of the paramilitary Basij organization who is now an activist and journalist, the progress in the nuclear talks is a vindication. “These people protesting the deal are a small, doomed group of losers who do not understand that the perceptions of the establishment have changed,” he said. “They can shout ‘Death to America’ all they want, but nobody in the government or in the establishment is in the mood for these sorts of actions.” Iran’s interior minister, Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli, issued a warning that henceforth no illegal gatherings would be allowed. “Those who are ‘worried’ or ‘not-worried,’ they all need a permit to protest so we can guarantee their security,” he told the Arman newspaper. But one of the organizers of the gathering, a 26-year-old student named Ali Mataji, said protest was necessary, “because we have the right to ask questions.” He added: “We will not stop, as there is a deviation of the national interests in the nuclear issue.” Outside the Parliament building, a passer-by started a discussion with Mr. Aziz, the engineering student. “Why don’t you wait with your criticism until the deal is more clear?” the man asked. “We need to bring awareness,” Mr. Aziz responded, waving his placard. The man shook his head, telling the protester, “Your actions are weakening the talks.” Advertisement
Fates of 3 Americans Held in Iran Remain Hazy Despite Diplomatic Progress	Advertisement Supported by By  The families of three American citizens of Iranian descent who are incarcerated in Iran, one of them held for more than three and a half years, have been hoping that the success of diplomacy on the nuclear dispute would herald their releases as good-will gestures. But the fates of the three — Jason Rezaian, 39, Saeed Abedini, 34, and Amir Hekmati, 31 — remained just as hazy as they had ever been on Friday, a day after the framework agreement was reached. They were barely mentioned in the initial flurry of news announcements on the framework agreement which, when finalized, would limit Iran’s nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief, and portend an end to the country’s prolonged isolation. Secretary of State John Kerry, after the announcement of an agreement at talks in Lausanne, Switzerland, was asked about the three Americans almost immediately and offered little in the way of an update except to reiterate the Obama administration’s determination to secure their freedom. “We have a very specific process in place to try to deal with it,” Mr. Kerry said. “And we call on Iran again today, now, in light of this, to release these Americans and let them get home with their families. And we’re working on that, and we will continue to be very focused on it.” Families of the three Americans, who have become increasingly vocal to raise public awareness, expressed appreciation of Mr. Kerry’s statement. But they could barely hide their frustration and disappointment. The family of Mr. Rezaian, a Washington Post correspondent and California native who has been imprisoned without publicly revealed charges since July 20, issued a challenging Iranian officials to follow their own laws and international human rights commitments. “Jason has been held more than twice as long as any prior Western journalist, and with no evidence that Iran is willing to claim justifies their actions,” said Mr. Rezaian’s brother Ali. “All Iran has said is that ‘it’s complicated.’ Now that a framework agreement has been announced, things should be less ‘complicated.’ ” Mr. Hekmati, a Marine veteran from Flint, Mich., who was arrested while visiting relatives in August 2011, was originally sentenced to death on an espionage conviction that was later overturned. He was convicted of the lesser charge of aiding a hostile country — meaning the United States — and sentenced to 10 years. He has repeatedly asserted his innocence, accused the Iranian penal authorities of mistreatment and described himself as a political prisoner. “Now that Iran has sat at the table next to the United States, working diligently to come to an agreement for a nuclear program, we ask Iran if they still consider the United States a hostile country and if they do not, perhaps it is time they open the prison gates and allow the Red Cross to visit Amir without guard and report on the status of his well-being,” his family in a statement. Mr. Abedini, of Boise, Idaho, was sentenced in 2013 to eight years in prison on charges of disturbing national security by creating a private network of churches. The American Center for Law and Justice, an advocacy group that represents his family, that with the achievement of a framework nuclear deal, “it is critical that our government use this unique opportunity — as our two nations continue to sit at the negotiating table over the next few weeks and months — to bring Pastor Saeed and the other wrongfully imprisoned Americans home to their families.” Advertisement
European Leaders Criticize Trump’s Disavowal of Iran Deal	Advertisement Supported by By  and LONDON — Iran, Russia and European leaders roundly condemned President Trump’s decision on Friday to disavow the , saying that it reflected the growing isolation of the United States, threatened to destabilize the Middle East and could make it harder to resolve the growing tensions on the Korean Peninsula. The reaction was far from panicked, as Mr. Trump’s decision punts to Congress the critical decision of whether the United States will reimpose sanctions on Iran — a step that would effectively sink the deal. But Mr. Trump also warned that unless the nuclear agreement was altered and made permanent — to prohibit Iran from ever developing nuclear weapons — he would terminate the agreement, an ultimatum that threw the future of the accord into question. Though they avoided direct criticism of Mr. Trump, Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Emmanuel Macron of France said in a rare joint statement that they “stand committed” to the 2015 nuclear deal and that preserving it was “in our shared national security interest.” “The nuclear deal was the culmination of 13 years of diplomacy and was a major step towards ensuring that Iran’s nuclear program is not diverted for military purposes,” they added. Sigmar Gabriel, Germany’s foreign minister, said that Mr. Trump was sending “a difficult and also from our point of view dangerous signal.” He said that the Iran deal, and other diplomatic achievements, were necessary “to convince countries like North Korea, and maybe also others, that it is possible to create security without acquiring nuclear weapons.” “Destroying this agreement would, worldwide, mean that others could no longer rely on such agreements — that’s why it is a danger that goes further than Iran,” he added. Reaction from Iran was quick and pointed. Appearing on television, its president, Hassan Rouhani, denounced Mr. Trump and called the United States an outlier that had become “more lonely than ever” in the international community. Mr. Rouhani did not threaten to withdraw from the deal, but made it clear that he would not renegotiate the terms, either. “The statements of Mr. Trump are nothing but abuse and threats against the people of Iran,” he said. “An international agreement cannot be disregarded.” The European leaders noted that the United Nations Security Council had unanimously endorsed the deal, and that the International Atomic Energy Agency had confirmed Iran’s compliance with it. But Mr. Trump’s aggressive stance on Iran won plaudits from several nations on Friday, specifically from adversaries of Iran like Israel, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister who has always opposed the agreement with Iran, said that Mr. Trump’s announcement created “an opportunity to fix this bad deal” and was a sign of Mr. Trump’s determination to “boldly confront Iran’s terrorist regime.” Saudi Arabia, which has waged a proxy battle against Iran for supremacy in the region and was the first country Mr. Trump visited after taking office, said it welcomed what it called a “new U.S. strategy” toward Iran. The United Arab Emirates, which like Saudi Arabia is a predominantly Sunni Muslim country with a sizable Shiite minority, also said that it “fully supports” Mr. Trump’s stance on Iran. Some leaders declared that the deal, reached in 2015 between Iran and six world powers, including the United States, was not something that Mr. Trump could cancel, contending that Mr. Trump was essentially putting on a show for his political base. “The president of the United States has many powers — not this one,” the European Union’s top diplomat, Federica Mogherini, said at a news conference in Brussels. She said that there had been no violations of the agreement and that the world could not afford to dismantle an accord that “is working and delivering,” especially at a time of “acute nuclear threat,” referring to the standoff with North Korea over its nuclear program. Criticism of the nuclear deal was a central theme of Mr. Trump’s candidacy for president, and he has repeatedly called for what he sees as a fatally flawed agreement. Mr. Trump said on Friday that under the current deal “Iran can sprint” toward the development of nuclear weapons when the deal’s restrictions expire. Some of the prohibitions in the agreement are set to end in 2025, including limits on the number of its centrifuges. Iran, which has always maintained that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, not for weapons, would not agree to a permanent freeze in its ability to enrich nuclear fuel. That must be changed, Mr. Trump said, or he would scrap the deal altogether. Russia, which took part in the negotiations to reach the accord and has warned Mr. Trump not to rescind it, said that the president had no basis for disavowing the deal. “Iran is abiding” by the nuclear agreement, Mikhail Ulyanov, a director at the Russian foreign ministry, told the Interfax news agency. “Everyone agrees with that. And an attempt to somehow heighten the tensions in this situation looks like unmotivated aggression.” In blunt language, Ms. Mogherini, the European Union’s top diplomat, essentially looked past Mr. Trump and appealed to Congress directly. America’s next step “is now in the hands of the United States Congress,” she said. “The international community and the European Union with it has clearly indicated that the deal is and will continue to be in place.” Russia urged American lawmakers to preserve the deal as well. “We want to hope that Congress will not take any dramatic steps which would effectively signify a collapse” of the deal, Russia’s deputy foreign minister told Interfax, referring to the renewed sanctions that might lead Iran to nullify the accord. In his remarks, Mr. Trump accused Iran of violating both the letter and the spirit of the accord. But Iran has accused the United States of doing the same, and on Friday its mission to the United Nations warned that Iran might itself back away from the deal. “Iran has many options on how to proceed and if necessary will terminate its commitment regarding this issue,” the mission said in a statement, without elaborating. Iran has also resisted the idea of renegotiating the nuclear agreement in the West’s favor. Last month, its foreign minister rejected extending the length or conditions of the accord, saying that Iran would consider changing the agreement only if the concessions it had already made — including giving up nuclear fuel — were reconsidered. There are fears that the basic framework of the accord could collapse if the United States walks away. Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, told reporters on Friday that Russia believed Iran would abandon the deal if the United States did. Stephen Castle reported from London, and Thomas Erdbrink from Dallas. Reporting was contributed by Victor Homola from Berlin, Sophia Kishkovsky from Moscow and Daphné Anglès and Liam Stack from Paris. Opinion Opinion Advertisement
Mr. Obama, Try These Arguments for Your Iran Deal	Advertisement Supported by By  It would be a catastrophe for American influence in the world if Congress killed the Iranian nuclear deal. Perhaps because the stakes are so high, the debate has become poisonous. Critics are (ludicrously) of appealing to anti-Semitic tropes. And Obama that some opponents were “alarmist,” “ignorant,” “not being straight” and “making common cause” with Iranians who chant “Death to America.” Obama’s rhetoric was counterproductive. As former Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Texas Republican, told me, “At this point, the president has made it impossible for a Republican to vote for it.” Constituent calls to congressional offices are overwhelmingly against the deal, and with Senator Chuck Schumer by opposing it, the opposition is more bipartisan than the support is. That’s tragic, for killing the deal would infuriate many allies, isolate America rather than Iran and ultimately increase the risk of ayatollahs with nuclear weapons. why I’m strongly in favor of the deal, and I urge President Obama to start over with his sales job and focus on three points. The great majority of arms experts support the deal, some enthusiastically, some grudgingly. They recognize shortcomings, but on balance, as 29 of America’s leading nuclear scientists and arms experts last week, it has “much more stringent constraints than any previously negotiated nonproliferation framework.” Likewise, three dozen retired American released declaring the deal “the most effective means currently available to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons.” Iran would go from maybe a few months from a bomb to a year away. The agreement doesn’t solve the underlying problem, but it may buy us 15 years. Yes, it would be nice if Iran gave up all its enriched uranium. But isn’t it better that it than that it give up none? Everyone knows Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel , but not everyone realizes other Israelis with far more security expertise support it. Ami Ayalon, former head of Israel’s Shin Bet security service, as “the best possible alternative.” And Efraim Halevy, former head of the Mossad, , “What is the point of canceling an agreement that distances Iran from the bomb?” Critics sometimes note that President Bill Clinton reached an agreement on nuclear weapons with North Korea in 1994, only to see North Korea cheat. The lesson they draw is that it’s pointless to negotiate with untrustworthy rogue regimes. I’ve covered North Korea since I was a young reporter in Asia in the 1980s, and the lesson is actually more like the opposite. That 1994 agreement was indeed flawed, and North Korea violated it. But even so, in the was in place, North Korea , according to American intelligence estimates. After the deal collapsed in 2002, the Bush administration turned to a policy of confrontation, and North Korea then made perhaps nine nuclear weapons. I asked David Petraeus, retired four-star general and former head of the C.I.A., about that. “I strongly believe,” he told me, “that there will continue to be a viable military option should Iran seek to break out and construct a nuclear device after the expiration of many of the elements of the inspections regime at the 15-year mark of the agreement.” To me, this deal is ugly and flawed — and infinitely better than the alternatives. The criticisms of the deal strike me as reasonable, but the alternatives that the critics propose seem unreasonable and incoherent. So President Obama should hit the restart button. He should acknowledge that the deal has shortcomings but also emphasize that it must be judged not by a referendum on its terms but rather as a choice: deal or no deal. He can also take steps to reassure doubters. We could boost funding for the International Atomic Energy Agency to make oversight more effective. We could do more to speak up for human rights in Iran and to counter Iranian meddling in the region, especially in Syria. Gen. Brent Scowcroft, the patriarch of Republican security experts, tells me that he supports the Iran deal in part because it exemplifies American leadership on a crucial global issue. I agree, and for Congress to kill it will not just set back American leadership, it will also increase the odds that Iran gets the bomb. Gail Collins is on book leave.

Skeptical of Iran Nuclear Deal, Israel Calls for Changes	Advertisement Supported by By  and JERUSALEM — Clearly unsatisfied with assurances from President Obama about the provisions of the nuclear deal, on Monday listed specific requirements that it declared were necessary in any final agreement. The list, produced by Yuval Steinitz, Israel’s minister of intelligence and strategic affairs and one of the Israeli government’s harshest critics of the negotiations, marked a change in direction for the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Until now, Israel has argued, at least publicly, that the only good deal would halt all uranium enrichment by Iran, essentially rolling back the clock by 20 years. It has never before defined the “better deal” that Mr. Netanyahu told Congress the world needed. But Mr. Steinitz’s list of desired modifications for the final agreement, due to be concluded by June 30, appeared carefully designed to echo some of the more sophisticated critiques of the agreement that have circulated since the United States described critical elements of the deal on Thursday. Israeli policy makers have grappled for some time with the question of whether to stick, at least publicly, to Israel’s maximalist demands, even though they appeared increasingly out of sync with the reality of a negotiation that clearly was going to require concessions on all sides. American and Iranian officials are using different words to describe elements of the preliminary agreement to limit Iran’s nuclear program. Before the details of the framework were made known, some Israeli officials feared that showing any flexibility might be interpreted as a green light by the Obama administration to engage in further give and take, precluding a more nuanced approach. Mr. Steinitz’s tone was a bit different, saying the changes — including some restraints American negotiators had attempted unsuccessfully to obtain in past negotiations — would make the accord “more reasonable.” But the Obama administration fears that reopening the issues with Iran in the last stages of the talks would invite it to do the same, rapidly unraveling the deal. So far, the administration has shown no inclination to relitigate some of the most contentious issues that have been argued over for the last two years, culminating in eight days of intense negotiation at a hotel in Lausanne, Switzerland, on the banks of Lake Geneva. But Mr. Steinitz said that the suggestion that there was no alternative to the framework, or that Israel had not put forward an alternative, “is wrong.” “The alternative is not necessarily to declare war on Iran,” he said, briefing international reporters at a Jerusalem hotel. “It is to increase pressure on Iran and stand firm and make Iran make serious concessions and have a much better deal.” The Lausanne framework calls on Iran to limit enrichment of uranium at its Natanz facility to a level useful only for civilian purposes, drastically cut its fuel stockpile and cut back the number of installed centrifuges by about two-thirds. It would convert the underground Fordo facility into a research center, but would be barred from enriching there. Iran would also modify its Arak heavy water reactor to drastically reduce its output of plutonium, another path to a bomb. In exchange, the United States and other nations would lift sanctions that have constrained the Iranian economy. President Obama said the sanctions would be lifted only after Iran had delivered on its commitments regarding Fordo, the centrifuges and other issues, although he said there were details still to be worked out. The Israeli list of additions to the framework includes the following:  An end to all research and development activity on advanced centrifuges in Iran. The Lausanne framework, as described by the United States, leaves unclear what kind of work Iran will conduct. But it is a worry to American and Israeli officials because Iran will be readying to deploy the much more efficient centrifuges as soon as the major limitations on uranium production end, in 2030.  A significant reduction in the number of centrifuges that are operational or that can quickly become operational if Iran breaks the agreement and decides to build a bomb. The accord allows about 5,000 to operate for the first decade at the main plant at Natanz, roughly half the number spinning today.  The closing of the as an enrichment site, even if enrichment activities are suspended there. This was also an early United States objective. The compromise struck allows a small number of centrifuges to spin but bars the enrichment of uranium there; instead, other elements will be created for medical isotopes.  Iranian compliance in revealing its past activities with “possible military dimensions.” It is unclear from the wording of the American statement if Iran must completely answer a dozen questions posed by the International Atomic Energy Agency — 11 of which it has declined to answer so far — before it would receive full sanctions relief.  A commitment to ship its stockpile of enriched uranium out of Iran. Iran said last week that it would not ship the stockpile out of the country, but the American statement left open the possibility of sending it abroad or diluting it in Iran.  “Anywhere, anytime” access for inspectors charged with verifying the agreement in Iran. The inspection regime falls short of this, but sets up some kind of mechanism — the details of which are unclear — to resolve disputes if Iran blocks inspection of a suspected site. The reaction from Israel came after that the preliminary agreement was the “best bet by far” to prevent Tehran from obtaining a nuclear weapon and his pledge to the Israelis that the United States had “got their backs.” The disagreements between Israel and the Obama administration over the Iran talks have severely strained the American-Israeli relationship in recent months, with the . The White House was infuriated by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s decision to address a joint meeting of Congress in March without consulting the White House. Despite Mr. Obama’s more conciliatory tone toward Israel in recent days, Israel has made it clear that it intends to keep up the pressure. On Sunday, Mr. Netanyahu appeared on ABC’s “This Week,” CNN’s “State of the Union” and NBC News’s “Meet the Press,” where he said: “I’m not trying to kill any deal. I’m trying to kill a bad deal.” Yet Israel’s former intelligence chiefs have been more welcoming. Efraim Halevy, a former head of Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency, suggested that those in Israel who have been critical of Mr. Obama should change their tone. Mr. Halevy told Israel’s Army Radio on Monday that “in order to influence you have to act with a certain kind of respect for your partner.” Adel al-Jubeir, Saudi Arabia’s ambassador in Washington, echoed the Saudi cabinet of ministers in expressing hope that the final deal in June would prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. A guide to help you navigate the deal between global powers and Tehran. He would not say whether the agreement announced by the United States last week had gone far enough toward meeting that goal. “I don’t know because the details have not been worked out.” he said. “There are a number of areas where, I think, more clarification needs to take place.” On Monday in Jerusalem, Mr. Steinitz, the minister of intelligence and strategic affairs, said Israel would be making further efforts to persuade the Obama administration and Congress, as well as Britain, France, Russia and other world powers, “not to sign this bad deal or at least to dramatically change or fix it.” Referring to , a New York Times columnist, Mr. Steinitz said it was “not good enough.” It was unsatisfactory, Mr. Steinitz said, because of the time required to refer suspicions to a committee, and because no nation would want to expose sensitive intelligence data to a committee that included an Iranian presence. But Mr. Steinitz said the Israeli government had conducted a “sober analysis” of the agreement and was raising questions, including why the framework does not address Iran’s intercontinental ballistic missile program, which it says threatens the United States. The negotiation has never included Iran’s missile capability. As Mr. Steinitz was outlining his government’s position, the White House said it was actively seeking out supporters of Israel in its intensive effort to build support for the agreement. “This is a deliberate attempt to make the case to individuals who are concerned about the security of Israel that going along with an agreement like this that would prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon isn’t just in the best national security interests of the United States, which it is, it’s also clearly in the best interests of the nation of Israel,” said Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary. “That will be an important part of our case moving forward.” Isabel Kershner reported from Jerusalem, and David E. Sanger from Washington. Julie Hirschfeld Davis and Michael R. Gordon contributed reporting from Washington. Advertisement
Trump Can Make the Most of a Bad Iran Deal	Advertisement Supported by Op-Ed Contributor By  WASHINGTON — Secretary of State last month that United States policy toward Iran shouldn’t begin and end with the nuclear deal. Washington’s issues with that country are far wider, Mr. Tillerson said, citing Iran’s meddling in Syria and Iraq, and its support for terrorist groups like Hezbollah. The secretary of state is certainly right about that. But he elided an important point: Without a stable approach to the nuclear deal, questions about its fate will distract from and ultimately hobble broader American diplomacy on Iran and other crucial issues in the Middle East. President Trump — who campaigned on promises to tear up the nuclear deal — has indicated that in mid-October, when the next 90-day deadline for recertifying Iran’s compliance with the agreement arrives, he will find that Iran has violated it. This could lead to the deal’s collapse. But there seems to be in any significant way. The Iranians appear to be exploiting and trying to get away with what they can when it comes to the deal’s limits on certain nuclear activities like the production and storage of heavy water. Likewise, they seem to be levied by the United Nations but not actually included in the nuclear agreement itself. None of these appear to constitute a material breach of the agreement. The problem the United States faces is not Iranian compliance, but the very terms of the agreement. Mr. Trump isn’t wrong when he says it’s a “bad deal.” It’s too narrow in scope, permitting Iran to work on its missile and centrifuge technology even while uranium enrichment is paused. More worrying, it’s only temporary. Some of its strictures begin to phase out in less than a decade, during which time Tehran can expand its power in the Middle East, just as the United States’ tools for trying to keep it in check — in particular, sanctions — are limited. But like it or not, the clock is not so easily turned back. Any realistic Iran policy must take this as its starting point. Rather than ripping up the deal or simply acquiescing to it, the Trump administration should strengthen both the deal and the policy framework of which it is a part. Stability on the issue of the nuclear agreement will eliminate a distraction and create leverage to rally international support for a better Middle East strategy. That’s why the United States should work with allies to more strictly interpret the existing text of the accord. Along with Britain, France and Germany — sometimes known as the E.U.3 — the United States should close any loopholes being exploited by Iran, increase intelligence cooperation on Iran’s nuclear activities and push international inspectors to interpret their mandate more broadly. These allies should also agree to enforce United Nations rules that aren’t included in the agreement, like those strictly limiting Iran’s arms trade. Working with these same allies, the United States should also tackle issues omitted from the nuclear deal, like Iran’s missile program. Through a package of sanctions, export controls, interdictions and missile defense, they should aim to prevent Iran from acquiring an intercontinental ballistic missile and from continuing to export missile technology. The United States and the E.U.3 should also address the problem of the nuclear deal’s expiration date by jointly declaring now that they intend to expand and extend the agreement, rather than allow Iran’s nuclear activities to suddenly increase when it expires. In parallel, they should seek to strengthen global nonproliferation efforts so that even if nuclear restrictions specific to Iran cannot be extended, Tehran faces more challenges to weaponization when the deal does lapse. All of this must go hand in hand with a larger strategy to counter Iranian aggression in the Middle East. Iran’s leaders appear to be increasingly self-confident, perceiving success in , and . And Iran is steadily expanding its network of . To reverse these trends, the United States must move from generalities about countering Iran to specific aims — for example, preventing Iranian forces from entrenching in , or deterring the use of anti-ship cruise missiles in the Bab el Mandeb Strait off Yemen’s coast. American officials need to communicate these boundaries to Iran and back them up with a range of tools, including sanctions, diplomacy and limited military force if necessary. These measures require help from America’s allies, who are not eager to fiddle with the nuclear agreement or face up to the problem of Iran’s regional policies. This is where diplomacy comes in. Allies in Europe and elsewhere know the deal is controversial in Washington, and they take seriously Mr. Trump’s threats to stop honoring it. Policy makers in Washington should make clear that their allies’ cooperation with efforts to strengthen the deal and counter Iran are required to avoid that outcome. The United States cannot subordinate its entire policy toward Iran or the Middle East to the preservation of the nuclear accord. And it shouldn’t shoulder sole responsibility for addressing Iran’s threats while Europe enjoys the deal’s benefits. Even then, this would constitute only the start of a policy for addressing the challenge of Iran. Iran is adept at exploiting chaos, which is endemic in the Middle East. Washington will need sound approaches to the wars in Syria and Yemen, Iraq’s fragility and other regional challenges like the . But none of this will be possible if there is an international crisis every time there’s a new deadline for certifying compliance or waiving sanctions. Michael Singh ( ), a former senior director for Middle East affairs at the United States National Security Council, is the managing director of Washington Institute for Near East Policy.

None	A group of Senate Democrats who had been pushing for legislation to impose new sanctions on Iran said Tuesday that they would hold off on a vote until late March. The decision is a victory for President Obama, who has threatened to veto any such legislation while negotiations with Iran are underway. , the group of 10 senators, led by Senator Robert Menendez — who is an author of the bill — said they would hold off in acknowledgment of Mr. Obama’s concern about congressional action. The senators said that they would not vote for the Nuclear Weapon Free Iran Act of 2015 before March 24, the deadline that was set for Iran to make concessions to demonstrate that its nuclear program is peaceful. They also said that they would vote for the legislation only if Iran failed to reach an agreement on a political framework “that addresses all parameters of a comprehensive agreement.” Negotiating teams had set June 30 as a deadline for concluding talks on technicalities of a comprehensive deal. Despite promising to hold off on a vote, the senators expressed doubts about Iran’s intentions. “We remain deeply skeptical that Iran is committed to making the concessions required to demonstrate to the world that its nuclear program is exclusively peaceful by March 24 â the deadline agreed upon for a political framework agreement,” they wrote. “Considering Iranâs history in nuclear negotiations and after two extensions of the joint plan of action, we are concerned that Iran is intentionally extending the negotiations to improve its leverage at the negotiating table.” Here is David E. Sanger’s article in today’s Times about American and Iranian lawmakers who are looking to influence negotiations. By DAVID E.

Iran’s Foreign Minister Warns of Unlimited Atomic Fuel Enrichment if Talks on Final Agreement Fail	Advertisement Supported by By  Iran’s foreign minister raised the prospect on Friday of unlimited Iranian atomic fuel enrichment if the final phase of talks with the United States and other big powers on Iran’s disputed nuclear program does not achieve an agreement by a June 30 deadline, with all sanctions dropped. The foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, also said the Americans had diverged from a on April 2 by publishing what they described as a fact sheet about the framework’s basic provisions. Contrary to that assertion, Mr. Zarif said, there would be no phased removal of sanctions to ensure Iranian compliance. American and Iranian officials are using different words to describe elements of the preliminary agreement to limit Iran’s nuclear program. “The United States for their own domestic reasons, and that’s their right and prerogative, produced a fact sheet, which was not exactly what we adopted,” Mr. Zarif . It was his first extensive interview with a Western news organization since the framework agreement was reached in Lausanne, Switzerland. Iran has been subjected to a litany of economic and financial sanctions over the years — from the United Nations Security Council, the United States and the European Union — over uranium enrichment and other nuclear activities. The framework agreement would curb those activities and provide guarantees that Iran’s nuclear program was peaceful in exchange for the removal of the sanctions, which have deeply hurt the Iranian economy. While Iranian officials have always asserted that their program is peaceful — and Mr. Zarif did so again in the Euronews interview — the language he used about a possible failure to reach a final agreement was unusually blunt. As Iran and world powers including the United States try to reach a deal on nuclear controls in exchange for the lifting of sanctions, Iranians from all walks of life are watching and hoping for a new start. “We’ve said from the beginning that we need to choose the path,” he said, speaking in English. “We can have the path of confrontation or we can have the path of cooperation. We cannot have a little bit of each. If we take the path of confrontation, the United States and the United Nations will continue with their sanctions, and Iran will continue with its enrichment program. Without any limitations.” Mr. Zarif’s interview was the second strong public pushback against the United States this week over the remaining challenges to resolving the nuclear dispute. On Wednesday, Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, worked out between the Obama administration and Congress that gave American lawmakers a greater voice on terms of a final deal. Iran, Mr. Rouhani said, was negotiating with a group of six countries — the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council plus Germany — not just the United States. Last week Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, who has the final word on Iran’s nuclear activities, said any final agreement must end all sanctions on the day that a pact is signed. video Advertisement
None	The best thing that can be said about the 98-1 on Thursday was that it did not make a flawed bill any worse. Republicans who are determined to sabotage the emerging nuclear agreement between Iran and the major powers wanted to pile on a number of problematic amendments but debate on them was precluded because of party infighting. The bill sets the procedures for Congress to review â and possibly vote on â the agreement, which would have Iran curb its nuclear program in return for a lifting of international sanctions. It would prohibit President Obama from waiving economic sanctions on Iran â the crucial element of any agreement under which Iran rolls back its nuclear program â for at least 30 days, and up to 52 days, after signing an agreement so Congress has time to weigh in. The legislation was the product of compromise among senators who are viscerally opposed to any deal with Iran and those who made an institutional argument that Congress must have a role in such an important agreement. The measure now goes to the House of Representatives, where passage is considered certain. In theory, the legislation creates new and potentially dangerous uncertainties for the nuclear agreement, which is supposed to be completed by June 30 and offers the best chance of restraining an Iranian program that had become a serious threat. But a letter sent to Mr. Obama by 150 House Democrats on Thursday was a welcome hint that Congress may not be able to kill a nuclear deal after all, no matter how hard the opponents are trying. In the letter, the lawmakers express strong support for the negotiations and the interim political framework that was announced last month. They urge Mr. Obama to âstay on courseâ towards a strong and verifiable final agreement and, taking implied aim at opponents who have raised the prospect of military action against Iran, declare that âwar itself will not make us safe.â The number and nature of the signatories is key, representing one-third of the members of the House and including Jewish members and Democratic leaders. That suggests there may be enough support in the House to prevent Congress from disapproving a final deal and from sustaining a disapproval vote over Mr. Obamaâs certain veto. The problem is that if Congress gets to the point of taking a vote of disapproval, that could cause Iran and the world to question Americaâs commitment to a final agreement, a potentially disastrous outcome if the deal is sound and verifiable.

Iran’s Leaders Fall Into Line Behind Nuclear Accord	Advertisement Supported by By  TEHRAN — Since the Islamic Revolution in 1979, Iranian hard-liners have been free to take to the streets and object to any form of compromise with the West, and particularly the United States. But when a conspicuously small group of hard-liners did so on Tuesday morning in front of the Parliament building, holding up placards and shouting slogans against the nuclear framework agreed to last week in Lausanne, Switzerland, the Iranian Interior Ministry condemned the demonstration as illegal, because the protesters had failed to obtain a permit. There were also very few reporters. It was perhaps the first time that conservatives — in this case mostly young people genuinely disappointed over the compromises has made to reach a nuclear agreement — seemed disconnected from the power structure here. Analysts say the message from the top is clear: Get with the program. Senior officials, important clerics, lawmakers and Revolutionary Guards commanders, who in the past have reflexively opposed any accommodation with the West, now go out of their way to laud Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and his team of negotiators, as well as the government of President Hassan Rouhani. On Tuesday, Gen. Mohammad Ali Jafari, the highest-ranking commander of the Corps, joined the chorus. “The Iranian nation and the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps thank these dear negotiators for their honest attempts and political jihad, and for their resistance on the defined red lines,” the semiofficial Mehr news agency quoted him as saying. One influential cleric even issued a statement to correct a quote attributed to him that suggested he had been slightly critical of the nuclear framework. “Unfortunately, these remarks are lies attributed to him,” the office of Ayatollah Naser Marakem Shirazi hastily made clear. American and Iranian officials are using different words to describe elements of the preliminary agreement to limit Iran’s nuclear program. Only one man had remained silent: Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader, whose word is always the last. However, analysts say the broad support among conservatives is almost certainly a reflection of his thinking. Hamidreza Taraghi, a political analyst close to Ayatollah Khamenei, said it should not be surprising that Iran’s establishment had closed ranks behind the negotiators and the talks. “Wherever Foreign Minister Zarif goes to explain about the negotiations, his arguments are convincing and accepted,” he said. “Of course, we worry about some details, but they will be hammered out and solved, we are sure.” On Tuesday, Mr. Zarif earned glowing praise after he paid a visit to Parliament to describe the nuclear framework and answer lawmakers’ questions. Outside were the 150 or so hard-line demonstrators. “We are the voice of the people,” one of the protesters said. “We are worried over this deal.” But some people passing by had different ideas. “Go home,” someone yelled from a car window. “Drink the chalice of poison,” another shouted, a reference to a remark by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the former leader of Iran, describing his bitter feelings upon signing a cease-fire after eight bloody years of war with Iraq. “The people can swear at us,” said Vahid Aziz, an engineering student who held up a placard saying “We Are Worried.” They can swear, he said, because Iran is a democracy. “We also have the right to say something.” A guide to help you navigate the deal between global powers and Tehran. But their opinion seems to be a minority one. In a poll conducted by the pro-government IRNA news agency, 96 percent of people in Tehran were found to support the nuclear deal. Opinion polls in Iran are notoriously unreliable, but the news agency insisted that 83 percent of the respondents “expressed happiness, hope and relief on hearing about the nuclear agreement achieved in Lausanne, Switzerland.” For those who have long lived under the enforced opinions of minority groups, like Nader Karimi Joni, a former member of the paramilitary Basij organization who is now an activist and journalist, the progress in the nuclear talks is a vindication. “These people protesting the deal are a small, doomed group of losers who do not understand that the perceptions of the establishment have changed,” he said. “They can shout ‘Death to America’ all they want, but nobody in the government or in the establishment is in the mood for these sorts of actions.” Iran’s interior minister, Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli, issued a warning that henceforth no illegal gatherings would be allowed. “Those who are ‘worried’ or ‘not-worried,’ they all need a permit to protest so we can guarantee their security,” he told the Arman newspaper. But one of the organizers of the gathering, a 26-year-old student named Ali Mataji, said protest was necessary, “because we have the right to ask questions.” He added: “We will not stop, as there is a deviation of the national interests in the nuclear issue.” Outside the Parliament building, a passer-by started a discussion with Mr. Aziz, the engineering student. “Why don’t you wait with your criticism until the deal is more clear?” the man asked. “We need to bring awareness,” Mr. Aziz responded, waving his placard. The man shook his head, telling the protester, “Your actions are weakening the talks.” Advertisement
Fates of 3 Americans Held in Iran Remain Hazy Despite Diplomatic Progress	Advertisement Supported by By  The families of three American citizens of Iranian descent who are incarcerated in Iran, one of them held for more than three and a half years, have been hoping that the success of diplomacy on the nuclear dispute would herald their releases as good-will gestures. But the fates of the three — Jason Rezaian, 39, Saeed Abedini, 34, and Amir Hekmati, 31 — remained just as hazy as they had ever been on Friday, a day after the framework agreement was reached. They were barely mentioned in the initial flurry of news announcements on the framework agreement which, when finalized, would limit Iran’s nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief, and portend an end to the country’s prolonged isolation. Secretary of State John Kerry, after the announcement of an agreement at talks in Lausanne, Switzerland, was asked about the three Americans almost immediately and offered little in the way of an update except to reiterate the Obama administration’s determination to secure their freedom. “We have a very specific process in place to try to deal with it,” Mr. Kerry said. “And we call on Iran again today, now, in light of this, to release these Americans and let them get home with their families. And we’re working on that, and we will continue to be very focused on it.” Families of the three Americans, who have become increasingly vocal to raise public awareness, expressed appreciation of Mr. Kerry’s statement. But they could barely hide their frustration and disappointment. The family of Mr. Rezaian, a Washington Post correspondent and California native who has been imprisoned without publicly revealed charges since July 20, issued a challenging Iranian officials to follow their own laws and international human rights commitments. “Jason has been held more than twice as long as any prior Western journalist, and with no evidence that Iran is willing to claim justifies their actions,” said Mr. Rezaian’s brother Ali. “All Iran has said is that ‘it’s complicated.’ Now that a framework agreement has been announced, things should be less ‘complicated.’ ” Mr. Hekmati, a Marine veteran from Flint, Mich., who was arrested while visiting relatives in August 2011, was originally sentenced to death on an espionage conviction that was later overturned. He was convicted of the lesser charge of aiding a hostile country — meaning the United States — and sentenced to 10 years. He has repeatedly asserted his innocence, accused the Iranian penal authorities of mistreatment and described himself as a political prisoner. “Now that Iran has sat at the table next to the United States, working diligently to come to an agreement for a nuclear program, we ask Iran if they still consider the United States a hostile country and if they do not, perhaps it is time they open the prison gates and allow the Red Cross to visit Amir without guard and report on the status of his well-being,” his family in a statement. Mr. Abedini, of Boise, Idaho, was sentenced in 2013 to eight years in prison on charges of disturbing national security by creating a private network of churches. The American Center for Law and Justice, an advocacy group that represents his family, that with the achievement of a framework nuclear deal, “it is critical that our government use this unique opportunity — as our two nations continue to sit at the negotiating table over the next few weeks and months — to bring Pastor Saeed and the other wrongfully imprisoned Americans home to their families.” Advertisement
European Leaders Criticize Trump’s Disavowal of Iran Deal	Advertisement Supported by By  and LONDON — Iran, Russia and European leaders roundly condemned President Trump’s decision on Friday to disavow the , saying that it reflected the growing isolation of the United States, threatened to destabilize the Middle East and could make it harder to resolve the growing tensions on the Korean Peninsula. The reaction was far from panicked, as Mr. Trump’s decision punts to Congress the critical decision of whether the United States will reimpose sanctions on Iran — a step that would effectively sink the deal. But Mr. Trump also warned that unless the nuclear agreement was altered and made permanent — to prohibit Iran from ever developing nuclear weapons — he would terminate the agreement, an ultimatum that threw the future of the accord into question. Though they avoided direct criticism of Mr. Trump, Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Emmanuel Macron of France said in a rare joint statement that they “stand committed” to the 2015 nuclear deal and that preserving it was “in our shared national security interest.” “The nuclear deal was the culmination of 13 years of diplomacy and was a major step towards ensuring that Iran’s nuclear program is not diverted for military purposes,” they added. Sigmar Gabriel, Germany’s foreign minister, said that Mr. Trump was sending “a difficult and also from our point of view dangerous signal.” He said that the Iran deal, and other diplomatic achievements, were necessary “to convince countries like North Korea, and maybe also others, that it is possible to create security without acquiring nuclear weapons.” “Destroying this agreement would, worldwide, mean that others could no longer rely on such agreements — that’s why it is a danger that goes further than Iran,” he added. Reaction from Iran was quick and pointed. Appearing on television, its president, Hassan Rouhani, denounced Mr. Trump and called the United States an outlier that had become “more lonely than ever” in the international community. Mr. Rouhani did not threaten to withdraw from the deal, but made it clear that he would not renegotiate the terms, either. “The statements of Mr. Trump are nothing but abuse and threats against the people of Iran,” he said. “An international agreement cannot be disregarded.” The European leaders noted that the United Nations Security Council had unanimously endorsed the deal, and that the International Atomic Energy Agency had confirmed Iran’s compliance with it. But Mr. Trump’s aggressive stance on Iran won plaudits from several nations on Friday, specifically from adversaries of Iran like Israel, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister who has always opposed the agreement with Iran, said that Mr. Trump’s announcement created “an opportunity to fix this bad deal” and was a sign of Mr. Trump’s determination to “boldly confront Iran’s terrorist regime.” Saudi Arabia, which has waged a proxy battle against Iran for supremacy in the region and was the first country Mr. Trump visited after taking office, said it welcomed what it called a “new U.S. strategy” toward Iran. The United Arab Emirates, which like Saudi Arabia is a predominantly Sunni Muslim country with a sizable Shiite minority, also said that it “fully supports” Mr. Trump’s stance on Iran. Some leaders declared that the deal, reached in 2015 between Iran and six world powers, including the United States, was not something that Mr. Trump could cancel, contending that Mr. Trump was essentially putting on a show for his political base. “The president of the United States has many powers — not this one,” the European Union’s top diplomat, Federica Mogherini, said at a news conference in Brussels. She said that there had been no violations of the agreement and that the world could not afford to dismantle an accord that “is working and delivering,” especially at a time of “acute nuclear threat,” referring to the standoff with North Korea over its nuclear program. Criticism of the nuclear deal was a central theme of Mr. Trump’s candidacy for president, and he has repeatedly called for what he sees as a fatally flawed agreement. Mr. Trump said on Friday that under the current deal “Iran can sprint” toward the development of nuclear weapons when the deal’s restrictions expire. Some of the prohibitions in the agreement are set to end in 2025, including limits on the number of its centrifuges. Iran, which has always maintained that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, not for weapons, would not agree to a permanent freeze in its ability to enrich nuclear fuel. That must be changed, Mr. Trump said, or he would scrap the deal altogether. Russia, which took part in the negotiations to reach the accord and has warned Mr. Trump not to rescind it, said that the president had no basis for disavowing the deal. “Iran is abiding” by the nuclear agreement, Mikhail Ulyanov, a director at the Russian foreign ministry, told the Interfax news agency. “Everyone agrees with that. And an attempt to somehow heighten the tensions in this situation looks like unmotivated aggression.” In blunt language, Ms. Mogherini, the European Union’s top diplomat, essentially looked past Mr. Trump and appealed to Congress directly. America’s next step “is now in the hands of the United States Congress,” she said. “The international community and the European Union with it has clearly indicated that the deal is and will continue to be in place.” Russia urged American lawmakers to preserve the deal as well. “We want to hope that Congress will not take any dramatic steps which would effectively signify a collapse” of the deal, Russia’s deputy foreign minister told Interfax, referring to the renewed sanctions that might lead Iran to nullify the accord. In his remarks, Mr. Trump accused Iran of violating both the letter and the spirit of the accord. But Iran has accused the United States of doing the same, and on Friday its mission to the United Nations warned that Iran might itself back away from the deal. “Iran has many options on how to proceed and if necessary will terminate its commitment regarding this issue,” the mission said in a statement, without elaborating. Iran has also resisted the idea of renegotiating the nuclear agreement in the West’s favor. Last month, its foreign minister rejected extending the length or conditions of the accord, saying that Iran would consider changing the agreement only if the concessions it had already made — including giving up nuclear fuel — were reconsidered. There are fears that the basic framework of the accord could collapse if the United States walks away. Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, told reporters on Friday that Russia believed Iran would abandon the deal if the United States did. Stephen Castle reported from London, and Thomas Erdbrink from Dallas. Reporting was contributed by Victor Homola from Berlin, Sophia Kishkovsky from Moscow and Daphné Anglès and Liam Stack from Paris. Opinion Opinion Advertisement
Mr. Obama, Try These Arguments for Your Iran Deal	Advertisement Supported by By  It would be a catastrophe for American influence in the world if Congress killed the Iranian nuclear deal. Perhaps because the stakes are so high, the debate has become poisonous. Critics are (ludicrously) of appealing to anti-Semitic tropes. And Obama that some opponents were “alarmist,” “ignorant,” “not being straight” and “making common cause” with Iranians who chant “Death to America.” Obama’s rhetoric was counterproductive. As former Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Texas Republican, told me, “At this point, the president has made it impossible for a Republican to vote for it.” Constituent calls to congressional offices are overwhelmingly against the deal, and with Senator Chuck Schumer by opposing it, the opposition is more bipartisan than the support is. That’s tragic, for killing the deal would infuriate many allies, isolate America rather than Iran and ultimately increase the risk of ayatollahs with nuclear weapons. why I’m strongly in favor of the deal, and I urge President Obama to start over with his sales job and focus on three points. The great majority of arms experts support the deal, some enthusiastically, some grudgingly. They recognize shortcomings, but on balance, as 29 of America’s leading nuclear scientists and arms experts last week, it has “much more stringent constraints than any previously negotiated nonproliferation framework.” Likewise, three dozen retired American released declaring the deal “the most effective means currently available to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons.” Iran would go from maybe a few months from a bomb to a year away. The agreement doesn’t solve the underlying problem, but it may buy us 15 years. Yes, it would be nice if Iran gave up all its enriched uranium. But isn’t it better that it than that it give up none? Everyone knows Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel , but not everyone realizes other Israelis with far more security expertise support it. Ami Ayalon, former head of Israel’s Shin Bet security service, as “the best possible alternative.” And Efraim Halevy, former head of the Mossad, , “What is the point of canceling an agreement that distances Iran from the bomb?” Critics sometimes note that President Bill Clinton reached an agreement on nuclear weapons with North Korea in 1994, only to see North Korea cheat. The lesson they draw is that it’s pointless to negotiate with untrustworthy rogue regimes. I’ve covered North Korea since I was a young reporter in Asia in the 1980s, and the lesson is actually more like the opposite. That 1994 agreement was indeed flawed, and North Korea violated it. But even so, in the was in place, North Korea , according to American intelligence estimates. After the deal collapsed in 2002, the Bush administration turned to a policy of confrontation, and North Korea then made perhaps nine nuclear weapons. I asked David Petraeus, retired four-star general and former head of the C.I.A., about that. “I strongly believe,” he told me, “that there will continue to be a viable military option should Iran seek to break out and construct a nuclear device after the expiration of many of the elements of the inspections regime at the 15-year mark of the agreement.” To me, this deal is ugly and flawed — and infinitely better than the alternatives. The criticisms of the deal strike me as reasonable, but the alternatives that the critics propose seem unreasonable and incoherent. So President Obama should hit the restart button. He should acknowledge that the deal has shortcomings but also emphasize that it must be judged not by a referendum on its terms but rather as a choice: deal or no deal. He can also take steps to reassure doubters. We could boost funding for the International Atomic Energy Agency to make oversight more effective. We could do more to speak up for human rights in Iran and to counter Iranian meddling in the region, especially in Syria. Gen. Brent Scowcroft, the patriarch of Republican security experts, tells me that he supports the Iran deal in part because it exemplifies American leadership on a crucial global issue. I agree, and for Congress to kill it will not just set back American leadership, it will also increase the odds that Iran gets the bomb. Gail Collins is on book leave.

Skeptical of Iran Nuclear Deal, Israel Calls for Changes	Advertisement Supported by By  and JERUSALEM — Clearly unsatisfied with assurances from President Obama about the provisions of the nuclear deal, on Monday listed specific requirements that it declared were necessary in any final agreement. The list, produced by Yuval Steinitz, Israel’s minister of intelligence and strategic affairs and one of the Israeli government’s harshest critics of the negotiations, marked a change in direction for the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Until now, Israel has argued, at least publicly, that the only good deal would halt all uranium enrichment by Iran, essentially rolling back the clock by 20 years. It has never before defined the “better deal” that Mr. Netanyahu told Congress the world needed. But Mr. Steinitz’s list of desired modifications for the final agreement, due to be concluded by June 30, appeared carefully designed to echo some of the more sophisticated critiques of the agreement that have circulated since the United States described critical elements of the deal on Thursday. Israeli policy makers have grappled for some time with the question of whether to stick, at least publicly, to Israel’s maximalist demands, even though they appeared increasingly out of sync with the reality of a negotiation that clearly was going to require concessions on all sides. American and Iranian officials are using different words to describe elements of the preliminary agreement to limit Iran’s nuclear program. Before the details of the framework were made known, some Israeli officials feared that showing any flexibility might be interpreted as a green light by the Obama administration to engage in further give and take, precluding a more nuanced approach. Mr. Steinitz’s tone was a bit different, saying the changes — including some restraints American negotiators had attempted unsuccessfully to obtain in past negotiations — would make the accord “more reasonable.” But the Obama administration fears that reopening the issues with Iran in the last stages of the talks would invite it to do the same, rapidly unraveling the deal. So far, the administration has shown no inclination to relitigate some of the most contentious issues that have been argued over for the last two years, culminating in eight days of intense negotiation at a hotel in Lausanne, Switzerland, on the banks of Lake Geneva. But Mr. Steinitz said that the suggestion that there was no alternative to the framework, or that Israel had not put forward an alternative, “is wrong.” “The alternative is not necessarily to declare war on Iran,” he said, briefing international reporters at a Jerusalem hotel. “It is to increase pressure on Iran and stand firm and make Iran make serious concessions and have a much better deal.” The Lausanne framework calls on Iran to limit enrichment of uranium at its Natanz facility to a level useful only for civilian purposes, drastically cut its fuel stockpile and cut back the number of installed centrifuges by about two-thirds. It would convert the underground Fordo facility into a research center, but would be barred from enriching there. Iran would also modify its Arak heavy water reactor to drastically reduce its output of plutonium, another path to a bomb. In exchange, the United States and other nations would lift sanctions that have constrained the Iranian economy. President Obama said the sanctions would be lifted only after Iran had delivered on its commitments regarding Fordo, the centrifuges and other issues, although he said there were details still to be worked out. The Israeli list of additions to the framework includes the following:  An end to all research and development activity on advanced centrifuges in Iran. The Lausanne framework, as described by the United States, leaves unclear what kind of work Iran will conduct. But it is a worry to American and Israeli officials because Iran will be readying to deploy the much more efficient centrifuges as soon as the major limitations on uranium production end, in 2030.  A significant reduction in the number of centrifuges that are operational or that can quickly become operational if Iran breaks the agreement and decides to build a bomb. The accord allows about 5,000 to operate for the first decade at the main plant at Natanz, roughly half the number spinning today.  The closing of the as an enrichment site, even if enrichment activities are suspended there. This was also an early United States objective. The compromise struck allows a small number of centrifuges to spin but bars the enrichment of uranium there; instead, other elements will be created for medical isotopes.  Iranian compliance in revealing its past activities with “possible military dimensions.” It is unclear from the wording of the American statement if Iran must completely answer a dozen questions posed by the International Atomic Energy Agency — 11 of which it has declined to answer so far — before it would receive full sanctions relief.  A commitment to ship its stockpile of enriched uranium out of Iran. Iran said last week that it would not ship the stockpile out of the country, but the American statement left open the possibility of sending it abroad or diluting it in Iran.  “Anywhere, anytime” access for inspectors charged with verifying the agreement in Iran. The inspection regime falls short of this, but sets up some kind of mechanism — the details of which are unclear — to resolve disputes if Iran blocks inspection of a suspected site. The reaction from Israel came after that the preliminary agreement was the “best bet by far” to prevent Tehran from obtaining a nuclear weapon and his pledge to the Israelis that the United States had “got their backs.” The disagreements between Israel and the Obama administration over the Iran talks have severely strained the American-Israeli relationship in recent months, with the . The White House was infuriated by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s decision to address a joint meeting of Congress in March without consulting the White House. Despite Mr. Obama’s more conciliatory tone toward Israel in recent days, Israel has made it clear that it intends to keep up the pressure. On Sunday, Mr. Netanyahu appeared on ABC’s “This Week,” CNN’s “State of the Union” and NBC News’s “Meet the Press,” where he said: “I’m not trying to kill any deal. I’m trying to kill a bad deal.” Yet Israel’s former intelligence chiefs have been more welcoming. Efraim Halevy, a former head of Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency, suggested that those in Israel who have been critical of Mr. Obama should change their tone. Mr. Halevy told Israel’s Army Radio on Monday that “in order to influence you have to act with a certain kind of respect for your partner.” Adel al-Jubeir, Saudi Arabia’s ambassador in Washington, echoed the Saudi cabinet of ministers in expressing hope that the final deal in June would prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. A guide to help you navigate the deal between global powers and Tehran. He would not say whether the agreement announced by the United States last week had gone far enough toward meeting that goal. “I don’t know because the details have not been worked out.” he said. “There are a number of areas where, I think, more clarification needs to take place.” On Monday in Jerusalem, Mr. Steinitz, the minister of intelligence and strategic affairs, said Israel would be making further efforts to persuade the Obama administration and Congress, as well as Britain, France, Russia and other world powers, “not to sign this bad deal or at least to dramatically change or fix it.” Referring to , a New York Times columnist, Mr. Steinitz said it was “not good enough.” It was unsatisfactory, Mr. Steinitz said, because of the time required to refer suspicions to a committee, and because no nation would want to expose sensitive intelligence data to a committee that included an Iranian presence. But Mr. Steinitz said the Israeli government had conducted a “sober analysis” of the agreement and was raising questions, including why the framework does not address Iran’s intercontinental ballistic missile program, which it says threatens the United States. The negotiation has never included Iran’s missile capability. As Mr. Steinitz was outlining his government’s position, the White House said it was actively seeking out supporters of Israel in its intensive effort to build support for the agreement. “This is a deliberate attempt to make the case to individuals who are concerned about the security of Israel that going along with an agreement like this that would prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon isn’t just in the best national security interests of the United States, which it is, it’s also clearly in the best interests of the nation of Israel,” said Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary. “That will be an important part of our case moving forward.” Isabel Kershner reported from Jerusalem, and David E. Sanger from Washington. Julie Hirschfeld Davis and Michael R. Gordon contributed reporting from Washington. Advertisement
Trump Can Make the Most of a Bad Iran Deal	Advertisement Supported by Op-Ed Contributor By  WASHINGTON — Secretary of State last month that United States policy toward Iran shouldn’t begin and end with the nuclear deal. Washington’s issues with that country are far wider, Mr. Tillerson said, citing Iran’s meddling in Syria and Iraq, and its support for terrorist groups like Hezbollah. The secretary of state is certainly right about that. But he elided an important point: Without a stable approach to the nuclear deal, questions about its fate will distract from and ultimately hobble broader American diplomacy on Iran and other crucial issues in the Middle East. President Trump — who campaigned on promises to tear up the nuclear deal — has indicated that in mid-October, when the next 90-day deadline for recertifying Iran’s compliance with the agreement arrives, he will find that Iran has violated it. This could lead to the deal’s collapse. But there seems to be in any significant way. The Iranians appear to be exploiting and trying to get away with what they can when it comes to the deal’s limits on certain nuclear activities like the production and storage of heavy water. Likewise, they seem to be levied by the United Nations but not actually included in the nuclear agreement itself. None of these appear to constitute a material breach of the agreement. The problem the United States faces is not Iranian compliance, but the very terms of the agreement. Mr. Trump isn’t wrong when he says it’s a “bad deal.” It’s too narrow in scope, permitting Iran to work on its missile and centrifuge technology even while uranium enrichment is paused. More worrying, it’s only temporary. Some of its strictures begin to phase out in less than a decade, during which time Tehran can expand its power in the Middle East, just as the United States’ tools for trying to keep it in check — in particular, sanctions — are limited. But like it or not, the clock is not so easily turned back. Any realistic Iran policy must take this as its starting point. Rather than ripping up the deal or simply acquiescing to it, the Trump administration should strengthen both the deal and the policy framework of which it is a part. Stability on the issue of the nuclear agreement will eliminate a distraction and create leverage to rally international support for a better Middle East strategy. That’s why the United States should work with allies to more strictly interpret the existing text of the accord. Along with Britain, France and Germany — sometimes known as the E.U.3 — the United States should close any loopholes being exploited by Iran, increase intelligence cooperation on Iran’s nuclear activities and push international inspectors to interpret their mandate more broadly. These allies should also agree to enforce United Nations rules that aren’t included in the agreement, like those strictly limiting Iran’s arms trade. Working with these same allies, the United States should also tackle issues omitted from the nuclear deal, like Iran’s missile program. Through a package of sanctions, export controls, interdictions and missile defense, they should aim to prevent Iran from acquiring an intercontinental ballistic missile and from continuing to export missile technology. The United States and the E.U.3 should also address the problem of the nuclear deal’s expiration date by jointly declaring now that they intend to expand and extend the agreement, rather than allow Iran’s nuclear activities to suddenly increase when it expires. In parallel, they should seek to strengthen global nonproliferation efforts so that even if nuclear restrictions specific to Iran cannot be extended, Tehran faces more challenges to weaponization when the deal does lapse. All of this must go hand in hand with a larger strategy to counter Iranian aggression in the Middle East. Iran’s leaders appear to be increasingly self-confident, perceiving success in , and . And Iran is steadily expanding its network of . To reverse these trends, the United States must move from generalities about countering Iran to specific aims — for example, preventing Iranian forces from entrenching in , or deterring the use of anti-ship cruise missiles in the Bab el Mandeb Strait off Yemen’s coast. American officials need to communicate these boundaries to Iran and back them up with a range of tools, including sanctions, diplomacy and limited military force if necessary. These measures require help from America’s allies, who are not eager to fiddle with the nuclear agreement or face up to the problem of Iran’s regional policies. This is where diplomacy comes in. Allies in Europe and elsewhere know the deal is controversial in Washington, and they take seriously Mr. Trump’s threats to stop honoring it. Policy makers in Washington should make clear that their allies’ cooperation with efforts to strengthen the deal and counter Iran are required to avoid that outcome. The United States cannot subordinate its entire policy toward Iran or the Middle East to the preservation of the nuclear accord. And it shouldn’t shoulder sole responsibility for addressing Iran’s threats while Europe enjoys the deal’s benefits. Even then, this would constitute only the start of a policy for addressing the challenge of Iran. Iran is adept at exploiting chaos, which is endemic in the Middle East. Washington will need sound approaches to the wars in Syria and Yemen, Iraq’s fragility and other regional challenges like the . But none of this will be possible if there is an international crisis every time there’s a new deadline for certifying compliance or waiving sanctions. Michael Singh ( ), a former senior director for Middle East affairs at the United States National Security Council, is the managing director of Washington Institute for Near East Policy.

None	A group of Senate Democrats who had been pushing for legislation to impose new sanctions on Iran said Tuesday that they would hold off on a vote until late March. The decision is a victory for President Obama, who has threatened to veto any such legislation while negotiations with Iran are underway. , the group of 10 senators, led by Senator Robert Menendez — who is an author of the bill — said they would hold off in acknowledgment of Mr. Obama’s concern about congressional action. The senators said that they would not vote for the Nuclear Weapon Free Iran Act of 2015 before March 24, the deadline that was set for Iran to make concessions to demonstrate that its nuclear program is peaceful. They also said that they would vote for the legislation only if Iran failed to reach an agreement on a political framework “that addresses all parameters of a comprehensive agreement.” Negotiating teams had set June 30 as a deadline for concluding talks on technicalities of a comprehensive deal. Despite promising to hold off on a vote, the senators expressed doubts about Iran’s intentions. “We remain deeply skeptical that Iran is committed to making the concessions required to demonstrate to the world that its nuclear program is exclusively peaceful by March 24 â the deadline agreed upon for a political framework agreement,” they wrote. “Considering Iranâs history in nuclear negotiations and after two extensions of the joint plan of action, we are concerned that Iran is intentionally extending the negotiations to improve its leverage at the negotiating table.” Here is David E. Sanger’s article in today’s Times about American and Iranian lawmakers who are looking to influence negotiations. By DAVID E.

Iran’s Foreign Minister Warns of Unlimited Atomic Fuel Enrichment if Talks on Final Agreement Fail	Advertisement Supported by By  Iran’s foreign minister raised the prospect on Friday of unlimited Iranian atomic fuel enrichment if the final phase of talks with the United States and other big powers on Iran’s disputed nuclear program does not achieve an agreement by a June 30 deadline, with all sanctions dropped. The foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, also said the Americans had diverged from a on April 2 by publishing what they described as a fact sheet about the framework’s basic provisions. Contrary to that assertion, Mr. Zarif said, there would be no phased removal of sanctions to ensure Iranian compliance. American and Iranian officials are using different words to describe elements of the preliminary agreement to limit Iran’s nuclear program. “The United States for their own domestic reasons, and that’s their right and prerogative, produced a fact sheet, which was not exactly what we adopted,” Mr. Zarif . It was his first extensive interview with a Western news organization since the framework agreement was reached in Lausanne, Switzerland. Iran has been subjected to a litany of economic and financial sanctions over the years — from the United Nations Security Council, the United States and the European Union — over uranium enrichment and other nuclear activities. The framework agreement would curb those activities and provide guarantees that Iran’s nuclear program was peaceful in exchange for the removal of the sanctions, which have deeply hurt the Iranian economy. While Iranian officials have always asserted that their program is peaceful — and Mr. Zarif did so again in the Euronews interview — the language he used about a possible failure to reach a final agreement was unusually blunt. As Iran and world powers including the United States try to reach a deal on nuclear controls in exchange for the lifting of sanctions, Iranians from all walks of life are watching and hoping for a new start. “We’ve said from the beginning that we need to choose the path,” he said, speaking in English. “We can have the path of confrontation or we can have the path of cooperation. We cannot have a little bit of each. If we take the path of confrontation, the United States and the United Nations will continue with their sanctions, and Iran will continue with its enrichment program. Without any limitations.” Mr. Zarif’s interview was the second strong public pushback against the United States this week over the remaining challenges to resolving the nuclear dispute. On Wednesday, Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, worked out between the Obama administration and Congress that gave American lawmakers a greater voice on terms of a final deal. Iran, Mr. Rouhani said, was negotiating with a group of six countries — the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council plus Germany — not just the United States. Last week Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, who has the final word on Iran’s nuclear activities, said any final agreement must end all sanctions on the day that a pact is signed. video Advertisement
None	The best thing that can be said about the 98-1 on Thursday was that it did not make a flawed bill any worse. Republicans who are determined to sabotage the emerging nuclear agreement between Iran and the major powers wanted to pile on a number of problematic amendments but debate on them was precluded because of party infighting. The bill sets the procedures for Congress to review â and possibly vote on â the agreement, which would have Iran curb its nuclear program in return for a lifting of international sanctions. It would prohibit President Obama from waiving economic sanctions on Iran â the crucial element of any agreement under which Iran rolls back its nuclear program â for at least 30 days, and up to 52 days, after signing an agreement so Congress has time to weigh in. The legislation was the product of compromise among senators who are viscerally opposed to any deal with Iran and those who made an institutional argument that Congress must have a role in such an important agreement. The measure now goes to the House of Representatives, where passage is considered certain. In theory, the legislation creates new and potentially dangerous uncertainties for the nuclear agreement, which is supposed to be completed by June 30 and offers the best chance of restraining an Iranian program that had become a serious threat. But a letter sent to Mr. Obama by 150 House Democrats on Thursday was a welcome hint that Congress may not be able to kill a nuclear deal after all, no matter how hard the opponents are trying. In the letter, the lawmakers express strong support for the negotiations and the interim political framework that was announced last month. They urge Mr. Obama to âstay on courseâ towards a strong and verifiable final agreement and, taking implied aim at opponents who have raised the prospect of military action against Iran, declare that âwar itself will not make us safe.â The number and nature of the signatories is key, representing one-third of the members of the House and including Jewish members and Democratic leaders. That suggests there may be enough support in the House to prevent Congress from disapproving a final deal and from sustaining a disapproval vote over Mr. Obamaâs certain veto. The problem is that if Congress gets to the point of taking a vote of disapproval, that could cause Iran and the world to question Americaâs commitment to a final agreement, a potentially disastrous outcome if the deal is sound and verifiable.

Iran’s Leaders Fall Into Line Behind Nuclear Accord	Advertisement Supported by By  TEHRAN — Since the Islamic Revolution in 1979, Iranian hard-liners have been free to take to the streets and object to any form of compromise with the West, and particularly the United States. But when a conspicuously small group of hard-liners did so on Tuesday morning in front of the Parliament building, holding up placards and shouting slogans against the nuclear framework agreed to last week in Lausanne, Switzerland, the Iranian Interior Ministry condemned the demonstration as illegal, because the protesters had failed to obtain a permit. There were also very few reporters. It was perhaps the first time that conservatives — in this case mostly young people genuinely disappointed over the compromises has made to reach a nuclear agreement — seemed disconnected from the power structure here. Analysts say the message from the top is clear: Get with the program. Senior officials, important clerics, lawmakers and Revolutionary Guards commanders, who in the past have reflexively opposed any accommodation with the West, now go out of their way to laud Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and his team of negotiators, as well as the government of President Hassan Rouhani. On Tuesday, Gen. Mohammad Ali Jafari, the highest-ranking commander of the Corps, joined the chorus. “The Iranian nation and the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps thank these dear negotiators for their honest attempts and political jihad, and for their resistance on the defined red lines,” the semiofficial Mehr news agency quoted him as saying. One influential cleric even issued a statement to correct a quote attributed to him that suggested he had been slightly critical of the nuclear framework. “Unfortunately, these remarks are lies attributed to him,” the office of Ayatollah Naser Marakem Shirazi hastily made clear. American and Iranian officials are using different words to describe elements of the preliminary agreement to limit Iran’s nuclear program. Only one man had remained silent: Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader, whose word is always the last. However, analysts say the broad support among conservatives is almost certainly a reflection of his thinking. Hamidreza Taraghi, a political analyst close to Ayatollah Khamenei, said it should not be surprising that Iran’s establishment had closed ranks behind the negotiators and the talks. “Wherever Foreign Minister Zarif goes to explain about the negotiations, his arguments are convincing and accepted,” he said. “Of course, we worry about some details, but they will be hammered out and solved, we are sure.” On Tuesday, Mr. Zarif earned glowing praise after he paid a visit to Parliament to describe the nuclear framework and answer lawmakers’ questions. Outside were the 150 or so hard-line demonstrators. “We are the voice of the people,” one of the protesters said. “We are worried over this deal.” But some people passing by had different ideas. “Go home,” someone yelled from a car window. “Drink the chalice of poison,” another shouted, a reference to a remark by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the former leader of Iran, describing his bitter feelings upon signing a cease-fire after eight bloody years of war with Iraq. “The people can swear at us,” said Vahid Aziz, an engineering student who held up a placard saying “We Are Worried.” They can swear, he said, because Iran is a democracy. “We also have the right to say something.” A guide to help you navigate the deal between global powers and Tehran. But their opinion seems to be a minority one. In a poll conducted by the pro-government IRNA news agency, 96 percent of people in Tehran were found to support the nuclear deal. Opinion polls in Iran are notoriously unreliable, but the news agency insisted that 83 percent of the respondents “expressed happiness, hope and relief on hearing about the nuclear agreement achieved in Lausanne, Switzerland.” For those who have long lived under the enforced opinions of minority groups, like Nader Karimi Joni, a former member of the paramilitary Basij organization who is now an activist and journalist, the progress in the nuclear talks is a vindication. “These people protesting the deal are a small, doomed group of losers who do not understand that the perceptions of the establishment have changed,” he said. “They can shout ‘Death to America’ all they want, but nobody in the government or in the establishment is in the mood for these sorts of actions.” Iran’s interior minister, Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli, issued a warning that henceforth no illegal gatherings would be allowed. “Those who are ‘worried’ or ‘not-worried,’ they all need a permit to protest so we can guarantee their security,” he told the Arman newspaper. But one of the organizers of the gathering, a 26-year-old student named Ali Mataji, said protest was necessary, “because we have the right to ask questions.” He added: “We will not stop, as there is a deviation of the national interests in the nuclear issue.” Outside the Parliament building, a passer-by started a discussion with Mr. Aziz, the engineering student. “Why don’t you wait with your criticism until the deal is more clear?” the man asked. “We need to bring awareness,” Mr. Aziz responded, waving his placard. The man shook his head, telling the protester, “Your actions are weakening the talks.” Advertisement
Fates of 3 Americans Held in Iran Remain Hazy Despite Diplomatic Progress	Advertisement Supported by By  The families of three American citizens of Iranian descent who are incarcerated in Iran, one of them held for more than three and a half years, have been hoping that the success of diplomacy on the nuclear dispute would herald their releases as good-will gestures. But the fates of the three — Jason Rezaian, 39, Saeed Abedini, 34, and Amir Hekmati, 31 — remained just as hazy as they had ever been on Friday, a day after the framework agreement was reached. They were barely mentioned in the initial flurry of news announcements on the framework agreement which, when finalized, would limit Iran’s nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief, and portend an end to the country’s prolonged isolation. Secretary of State John Kerry, after the announcement of an agreement at talks in Lausanne, Switzerland, was asked about the three Americans almost immediately and offered little in the way of an update except to reiterate the Obama administration’s determination to secure their freedom. “We have a very specific process in place to try to deal with it,” Mr. Kerry said. “And we call on Iran again today, now, in light of this, to release these Americans and let them get home with their families. And we’re working on that, and we will continue to be very focused on it.” Families of the three Americans, who have become increasingly vocal to raise public awareness, expressed appreciation of Mr. Kerry’s statement. But they could barely hide their frustration and disappointment. The family of Mr. Rezaian, a Washington Post correspondent and California native who has been imprisoned without publicly revealed charges since July 20, issued a challenging Iranian officials to follow their own laws and international human rights commitments. “Jason has been held more than twice as long as any prior Western journalist, and with no evidence that Iran is willing to claim justifies their actions,” said Mr. Rezaian’s brother Ali. “All Iran has said is that ‘it’s complicated.’ Now that a framework agreement has been announced, things should be less ‘complicated.’ ” Mr. Hekmati, a Marine veteran from Flint, Mich., who was arrested while visiting relatives in August 2011, was originally sentenced to death on an espionage conviction that was later overturned. He was convicted of the lesser charge of aiding a hostile country — meaning the United States — and sentenced to 10 years. He has repeatedly asserted his innocence, accused the Iranian penal authorities of mistreatment and described himself as a political prisoner. “Now that Iran has sat at the table next to the United States, working diligently to come to an agreement for a nuclear program, we ask Iran if they still consider the United States a hostile country and if they do not, perhaps it is time they open the prison gates and allow the Red Cross to visit Amir without guard and report on the status of his well-being,” his family in a statement. Mr. Abedini, of Boise, Idaho, was sentenced in 2013 to eight years in prison on charges of disturbing national security by creating a private network of churches. The American Center for Law and Justice, an advocacy group that represents his family, that with the achievement of a framework nuclear deal, “it is critical that our government use this unique opportunity — as our two nations continue to sit at the negotiating table over the next few weeks and months — to bring Pastor Saeed and the other wrongfully imprisoned Americans home to their families.” Advertisement
European Leaders Criticize Trump’s Disavowal of Iran Deal	Advertisement Supported by By  and LONDON — Iran, Russia and European leaders roundly condemned President Trump’s decision on Friday to disavow the , saying that it reflected the growing isolation of the United States, threatened to destabilize the Middle East and could make it harder to resolve the growing tensions on the Korean Peninsula. The reaction was far from panicked, as Mr. Trump’s decision punts to Congress the critical decision of whether the United States will reimpose sanctions on Iran — a step that would effectively sink the deal. But Mr. Trump also warned that unless the nuclear agreement was altered and made permanent — to prohibit Iran from ever developing nuclear weapons — he would terminate the agreement, an ultimatum that threw the future of the accord into question. Though they avoided direct criticism of Mr. Trump, Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Emmanuel Macron of France said in a rare joint statement that they “stand committed” to the 2015 nuclear deal and that preserving it was “in our shared national security interest.” “The nuclear deal was the culmination of 13 years of diplomacy and was a major step towards ensuring that Iran’s nuclear program is not diverted for military purposes,” they added. Sigmar Gabriel, Germany’s foreign minister, said that Mr. Trump was sending “a difficult and also from our point of view dangerous signal.” He said that the Iran deal, and other diplomatic achievements, were necessary “to convince countries like North Korea, and maybe also others, that it is possible to create security without acquiring nuclear weapons.” “Destroying this agreement would, worldwide, mean that others could no longer rely on such agreements — that’s why it is a danger that goes further than Iran,” he added. Reaction from Iran was quick and pointed. Appearing on television, its president, Hassan Rouhani, denounced Mr. Trump and called the United States an outlier that had become “more lonely than ever” in the international community. Mr. Rouhani did not threaten to withdraw from the deal, but made it clear that he would not renegotiate the terms, either. “The statements of Mr. Trump are nothing but abuse and threats against the people of Iran,” he said. “An international agreement cannot be disregarded.” The European leaders noted that the United Nations Security Council had unanimously endorsed the deal, and that the International Atomic Energy Agency had confirmed Iran’s compliance with it. But Mr. Trump’s aggressive stance on Iran won plaudits from several nations on Friday, specifically from adversaries of Iran like Israel, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister who has always opposed the agreement with Iran, said that Mr. Trump’s announcement created “an opportunity to fix this bad deal” and was a sign of Mr. Trump’s determination to “boldly confront Iran’s terrorist regime.” Saudi Arabia, which has waged a proxy battle against Iran for supremacy in the region and was the first country Mr. Trump visited after taking office, said it welcomed what it called a “new U.S. strategy” toward Iran. The United Arab Emirates, which like Saudi Arabia is a predominantly Sunni Muslim country with a sizable Shiite minority, also said that it “fully supports” Mr. Trump’s stance on Iran. Some leaders declared that the deal, reached in 2015 between Iran and six world powers, including the United States, was not something that Mr. Trump could cancel, contending that Mr. Trump was essentially putting on a show for his political base. “The president of the United States has many powers — not this one,” the European Union’s top diplomat, Federica Mogherini, said at a news conference in Brussels. She said that there had been no violations of the agreement and that the world could not afford to dismantle an accord that “is working and delivering,” especially at a time of “acute nuclear threat,” referring to the standoff with North Korea over its nuclear program. Criticism of the nuclear deal was a central theme of Mr. Trump’s candidacy for president, and he has repeatedly called for what he sees as a fatally flawed agreement. Mr. Trump said on Friday that under the current deal “Iran can sprint” toward the development of nuclear weapons when the deal’s restrictions expire. Some of the prohibitions in the agreement are set to end in 2025, including limits on the number of its centrifuges. Iran, which has always maintained that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, not for weapons, would not agree to a permanent freeze in its ability to enrich nuclear fuel. That must be changed, Mr. Trump said, or he would scrap the deal altogether. Russia, which took part in the negotiations to reach the accord and has warned Mr. Trump not to rescind it, said that the president had no basis for disavowing the deal. “Iran is abiding” by the nuclear agreement, Mikhail Ulyanov, a director at the Russian foreign ministry, told the Interfax news agency. “Everyone agrees with that. And an attempt to somehow heighten the tensions in this situation looks like unmotivated aggression.” In blunt language, Ms. Mogherini, the European Union’s top diplomat, essentially looked past Mr. Trump and appealed to Congress directly. America’s next step “is now in the hands of the United States Congress,” she said. “The international community and the European Union with it has clearly indicated that the deal is and will continue to be in place.” Russia urged American lawmakers to preserve the deal as well. “We want to hope that Congress will not take any dramatic steps which would effectively signify a collapse” of the deal, Russia’s deputy foreign minister told Interfax, referring to the renewed sanctions that might lead Iran to nullify the accord. In his remarks, Mr. Trump accused Iran of violating both the letter and the spirit of the accord. But Iran has accused the United States of doing the same, and on Friday its mission to the United Nations warned that Iran might itself back away from the deal. “Iran has many options on how to proceed and if necessary will terminate its commitment regarding this issue,” the mission said in a statement, without elaborating. Iran has also resisted the idea of renegotiating the nuclear agreement in the West’s favor. Last month, its foreign minister rejected extending the length or conditions of the accord, saying that Iran would consider changing the agreement only if the concessions it had already made — including giving up nuclear fuel — were reconsidered. There are fears that the basic framework of the accord could collapse if the United States walks away. Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, told reporters on Friday that Russia believed Iran would abandon the deal if the United States did. Stephen Castle reported from London, and Thomas Erdbrink from Dallas. Reporting was contributed by Victor Homola from Berlin, Sophia Kishkovsky from Moscow and Daphné Anglès and Liam Stack from Paris. Opinion Opinion Advertisement
Mr. Obama, Try These Arguments for Your Iran Deal	Advertisement Supported by By  It would be a catastrophe for American influence in the world if Congress killed the Iranian nuclear deal. Perhaps because the stakes are so high, the debate has become poisonous. Critics are (ludicrously) of appealing to anti-Semitic tropes. And Obama that some opponents were “alarmist,” “ignorant,” “not being straight” and “making common cause” with Iranians who chant “Death to America.” Obama’s rhetoric was counterproductive. As former Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Texas Republican, told me, “At this point, the president has made it impossible for a Republican to vote for it.” Constituent calls to congressional offices are overwhelmingly against the deal, and with Senator Chuck Schumer by opposing it, the opposition is more bipartisan than the support is. That’s tragic, for killing the deal would infuriate many allies, isolate America rather than Iran and ultimately increase the risk of ayatollahs with nuclear weapons. why I’m strongly in favor of the deal, and I urge President Obama to start over with his sales job and focus on three points. The great majority of arms experts support the deal, some enthusiastically, some grudgingly. They recognize shortcomings, but on balance, as 29 of America’s leading nuclear scientists and arms experts last week, it has “much more stringent constraints than any previously negotiated nonproliferation framework.” Likewise, three dozen retired American released declaring the deal “the most effective means currently available to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons.” Iran would go from maybe a few months from a bomb to a year away. The agreement doesn’t solve the underlying problem, but it may buy us 15 years. Yes, it would be nice if Iran gave up all its enriched uranium. But isn’t it better that it than that it give up none? Everyone knows Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel , but not everyone realizes other Israelis with far more security expertise support it. Ami Ayalon, former head of Israel’s Shin Bet security service, as “the best possible alternative.” And Efraim Halevy, former head of the Mossad, , “What is the point of canceling an agreement that distances Iran from the bomb?” Critics sometimes note that President Bill Clinton reached an agreement on nuclear weapons with North Korea in 1994, only to see North Korea cheat. The lesson they draw is that it’s pointless to negotiate with untrustworthy rogue regimes. I’ve covered North Korea since I was a young reporter in Asia in the 1980s, and the lesson is actually more like the opposite. That 1994 agreement was indeed flawed, and North Korea violated it. But even so, in the was in place, North Korea , according to American intelligence estimates. After the deal collapsed in 2002, the Bush administration turned to a policy of confrontation, and North Korea then made perhaps nine nuclear weapons. I asked David Petraeus, retired four-star general and former head of the C.I.A., about that. “I strongly believe,” he told me, “that there will continue to be a viable military option should Iran seek to break out and construct a nuclear device after the expiration of many of the elements of the inspections regime at the 15-year mark of the agreement.” To me, this deal is ugly and flawed — and infinitely better than the alternatives. The criticisms of the deal strike me as reasonable, but the alternatives that the critics propose seem unreasonable and incoherent. So President Obama should hit the restart button. He should acknowledge that the deal has shortcomings but also emphasize that it must be judged not by a referendum on its terms but rather as a choice: deal or no deal. He can also take steps to reassure doubters. We could boost funding for the International Atomic Energy Agency to make oversight more effective. We could do more to speak up for human rights in Iran and to counter Iranian meddling in the region, especially in Syria. Gen. Brent Scowcroft, the patriarch of Republican security experts, tells me that he supports the Iran deal in part because it exemplifies American leadership on a crucial global issue. I agree, and for Congress to kill it will not just set back American leadership, it will also increase the odds that Iran gets the bomb. Gail Collins is on book leave.

Skeptical of Iran Nuclear Deal, Israel Calls for Changes	Advertisement Supported by By  and JERUSALEM — Clearly unsatisfied with assurances from President Obama about the provisions of the nuclear deal, on Monday listed specific requirements that it declared were necessary in any final agreement. The list, produced by Yuval Steinitz, Israel’s minister of intelligence and strategic affairs and one of the Israeli government’s harshest critics of the negotiations, marked a change in direction for the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Until now, Israel has argued, at least publicly, that the only good deal would halt all uranium enrichment by Iran, essentially rolling back the clock by 20 years. It has never before defined the “better deal” that Mr. Netanyahu told Congress the world needed. But Mr. Steinitz’s list of desired modifications for the final agreement, due to be concluded by June 30, appeared carefully designed to echo some of the more sophisticated critiques of the agreement that have circulated since the United States described critical elements of the deal on Thursday. Israeli policy makers have grappled for some time with the question of whether to stick, at least publicly, to Israel’s maximalist demands, even though they appeared increasingly out of sync with the reality of a negotiation that clearly was going to require concessions on all sides. American and Iranian officials are using different words to describe elements of the preliminary agreement to limit Iran’s nuclear program. Before the details of the framework were made known, some Israeli officials feared that showing any flexibility might be interpreted as a green light by the Obama administration to engage in further give and take, precluding a more nuanced approach. Mr. Steinitz’s tone was a bit different, saying the changes — including some restraints American negotiators had attempted unsuccessfully to obtain in past negotiations — would make the accord “more reasonable.” But the Obama administration fears that reopening the issues with Iran in the last stages of the talks would invite it to do the same, rapidly unraveling the deal. So far, the administration has shown no inclination to relitigate some of the most contentious issues that have been argued over for the last two years, culminating in eight days of intense negotiation at a hotel in Lausanne, Switzerland, on the banks of Lake Geneva. But Mr. Steinitz said that the suggestion that there was no alternative to the framework, or that Israel had not put forward an alternative, “is wrong.” “The alternative is not necessarily to declare war on Iran,” he said, briefing international reporters at a Jerusalem hotel. “It is to increase pressure on Iran and stand firm and make Iran make serious concessions and have a much better deal.” The Lausanne framework calls on Iran to limit enrichment of uranium at its Natanz facility to a level useful only for civilian purposes, drastically cut its fuel stockpile and cut back the number of installed centrifuges by about two-thirds. It would convert the underground Fordo facility into a research center, but would be barred from enriching there. Iran would also modify its Arak heavy water reactor to drastically reduce its output of plutonium, another path to a bomb. In exchange, the United States and other nations would lift sanctions that have constrained the Iranian economy. President Obama said the sanctions would be lifted only after Iran had delivered on its commitments regarding Fordo, the centrifuges and other issues, although he said there were details still to be worked out. The Israeli list of additions to the framework includes the following:  An end to all research and development activity on advanced centrifuges in Iran. The Lausanne framework, as described by the United States, leaves unclear what kind of work Iran will conduct. But it is a worry to American and Israeli officials because Iran will be readying to deploy the much more efficient centrifuges as soon as the major limitations on uranium production end, in 2030.  A significant reduction in the number of centrifuges that are operational or that can quickly become operational if Iran breaks the agreement and decides to build a bomb. The accord allows about 5,000 to operate for the first decade at the main plant at Natanz, roughly half the number spinning today.  The closing of the as an enrichment site, even if enrichment activities are suspended there. This was also an early United States objective. The compromise struck allows a small number of centrifuges to spin but bars the enrichment of uranium there; instead, other elements will be created for medical isotopes.  Iranian compliance in revealing its past activities with “possible military dimensions.” It is unclear from the wording of the American statement if Iran must completely answer a dozen questions posed by the International Atomic Energy Agency — 11 of which it has declined to answer so far — before it would receive full sanctions relief.  A commitment to ship its stockpile of enriched uranium out of Iran. Iran said last week that it would not ship the stockpile out of the country, but the American statement left open the possibility of sending it abroad or diluting it in Iran.  “Anywhere, anytime” access for inspectors charged with verifying the agreement in Iran. The inspection regime falls short of this, but sets up some kind of mechanism — the details of which are unclear — to resolve disputes if Iran blocks inspection of a suspected site. The reaction from Israel came after that the preliminary agreement was the “best bet by far” to prevent Tehran from obtaining a nuclear weapon and his pledge to the Israelis that the United States had “got their backs.” The disagreements between Israel and the Obama administration over the Iran talks have severely strained the American-Israeli relationship in recent months, with the . The White House was infuriated by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s decision to address a joint meeting of Congress in March without consulting the White House. Despite Mr. Obama’s more conciliatory tone toward Israel in recent days, Israel has made it clear that it intends to keep up the pressure. On Sunday, Mr. Netanyahu appeared on ABC’s “This Week,” CNN’s “State of the Union” and NBC News’s “Meet the Press,” where he said: “I’m not trying to kill any deal. I’m trying to kill a bad deal.” Yet Israel’s former intelligence chiefs have been more welcoming. Efraim Halevy, a former head of Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency, suggested that those in Israel who have been critical of Mr. Obama should change their tone. Mr. Halevy told Israel’s Army Radio on Monday that “in order to influence you have to act with a certain kind of respect for your partner.” Adel al-Jubeir, Saudi Arabia’s ambassador in Washington, echoed the Saudi cabinet of ministers in expressing hope that the final deal in June would prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. A guide to help you navigate the deal between global powers and Tehran. He would not say whether the agreement announced by the United States last week had gone far enough toward meeting that goal. “I don’t know because the details have not been worked out.” he said. “There are a number of areas where, I think, more clarification needs to take place.” On Monday in Jerusalem, Mr. Steinitz, the minister of intelligence and strategic affairs, said Israel would be making further efforts to persuade the Obama administration and Congress, as well as Britain, France, Russia and other world powers, “not to sign this bad deal or at least to dramatically change or fix it.” Referring to , a New York Times columnist, Mr. Steinitz said it was “not good enough.” It was unsatisfactory, Mr. Steinitz said, because of the time required to refer suspicions to a committee, and because no nation would want to expose sensitive intelligence data to a committee that included an Iranian presence. But Mr. Steinitz said the Israeli government had conducted a “sober analysis” of the agreement and was raising questions, including why the framework does not address Iran’s intercontinental ballistic missile program, which it says threatens the United States. The negotiation has never included Iran’s missile capability. As Mr. Steinitz was outlining his government’s position, the White House said it was actively seeking out supporters of Israel in its intensive effort to build support for the agreement. “This is a deliberate attempt to make the case to individuals who are concerned about the security of Israel that going along with an agreement like this that would prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon isn’t just in the best national security interests of the United States, which it is, it’s also clearly in the best interests of the nation of Israel,” said Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary. “That will be an important part of our case moving forward.” Isabel Kershner reported from Jerusalem, and David E. Sanger from Washington. Julie Hirschfeld Davis and Michael R. Gordon contributed reporting from Washington. Advertisement
Trump Can Make the Most of a Bad Iran Deal	Advertisement Supported by Op-Ed Contributor By  WASHINGTON — Secretary of State last month that United States policy toward Iran shouldn’t begin and end with the nuclear deal. Washington’s issues with that country are far wider, Mr. Tillerson said, citing Iran’s meddling in Syria and Iraq, and its support for terrorist groups like Hezbollah. The secretary of state is certainly right about that. But he elided an important point: Without a stable approach to the nuclear deal, questions about its fate will distract from and ultimately hobble broader American diplomacy on Iran and other crucial issues in the Middle East. President Trump — who campaigned on promises to tear up the nuclear deal — has indicated that in mid-October, when the next 90-day deadline for recertifying Iran’s compliance with the agreement arrives, he will find that Iran has violated it. This could lead to the deal’s collapse. But there seems to be in any significant way. The Iranians appear to be exploiting and trying to get away with what they can when it comes to the deal’s limits on certain nuclear activities like the production and storage of heavy water. Likewise, they seem to be levied by the United Nations but not actually included in the nuclear agreement itself. None of these appear to constitute a material breach of the agreement. The problem the United States faces is not Iranian compliance, but the very terms of the agreement. Mr. Trump isn’t wrong when he says it’s a “bad deal.” It’s too narrow in scope, permitting Iran to work on its missile and centrifuge technology even while uranium enrichment is paused. More worrying, it’s only temporary. Some of its strictures begin to phase out in less than a decade, during which time Tehran can expand its power in the Middle East, just as the United States’ tools for trying to keep it in check — in particular, sanctions — are limited. But like it or not, the clock is not so easily turned back. Any realistic Iran policy must take this as its starting point. Rather than ripping up the deal or simply acquiescing to it, the Trump administration should strengthen both the deal and the policy framework of which it is a part. Stability on the issue of the nuclear agreement will eliminate a distraction and create leverage to rally international support for a better Middle East strategy. That’s why the United States should work with allies to more strictly interpret the existing text of the accord. Along with Britain, France and Germany — sometimes known as the E.U.3 — the United States should close any loopholes being exploited by Iran, increase intelligence cooperation on Iran’s nuclear activities and push international inspectors to interpret their mandate more broadly. These allies should also agree to enforce United Nations rules that aren’t included in the agreement, like those strictly limiting Iran’s arms trade. Working with these same allies, the United States should also tackle issues omitted from the nuclear deal, like Iran’s missile program. Through a package of sanctions, export controls, interdictions and missile defense, they should aim to prevent Iran from acquiring an intercontinental ballistic missile and from continuing to export missile technology. The United States and the E.U.3 should also address the problem of the nuclear deal’s expiration date by jointly declaring now that they intend to expand and extend the agreement, rather than allow Iran’s nuclear activities to suddenly increase when it expires. In parallel, they should seek to strengthen global nonproliferation efforts so that even if nuclear restrictions specific to Iran cannot be extended, Tehran faces more challenges to weaponization when the deal does lapse. All of this must go hand in hand with a larger strategy to counter Iranian aggression in the Middle East. Iran’s leaders appear to be increasingly self-confident, perceiving success in , and . And Iran is steadily expanding its network of . To reverse these trends, the United States must move from generalities about countering Iran to specific aims — for example, preventing Iranian forces from entrenching in , or deterring the use of anti-ship cruise missiles in the Bab el Mandeb Strait off Yemen’s coast. American officials need to communicate these boundaries to Iran and back them up with a range of tools, including sanctions, diplomacy and limited military force if necessary. These measures require help from America’s allies, who are not eager to fiddle with the nuclear agreement or face up to the problem of Iran’s regional policies. This is where diplomacy comes in. Allies in Europe and elsewhere know the deal is controversial in Washington, and they take seriously Mr. Trump’s threats to stop honoring it. Policy makers in Washington should make clear that their allies’ cooperation with efforts to strengthen the deal and counter Iran are required to avoid that outcome. The United States cannot subordinate its entire policy toward Iran or the Middle East to the preservation of the nuclear accord. And it shouldn’t shoulder sole responsibility for addressing Iran’s threats while Europe enjoys the deal’s benefits. Even then, this would constitute only the start of a policy for addressing the challenge of Iran. Iran is adept at exploiting chaos, which is endemic in the Middle East. Washington will need sound approaches to the wars in Syria and Yemen, Iraq’s fragility and other regional challenges like the . But none of this will be possible if there is an international crisis every time there’s a new deadline for certifying compliance or waiving sanctions. Michael Singh ( ), a former senior director for Middle East affairs at the United States National Security Council, is the managing director of Washington Institute for Near East Policy.

None	A group of Senate Democrats who had been pushing for legislation to impose new sanctions on Iran said Tuesday that they would hold off on a vote until late March. The decision is a victory for President Obama, who has threatened to veto any such legislation while negotiations with Iran are underway. , the group of 10 senators, led by Senator Robert Menendez — who is an author of the bill — said they would hold off in acknowledgment of Mr. Obama’s concern about congressional action. The senators said that they would not vote for the Nuclear Weapon Free Iran Act of 2015 before March 24, the deadline that was set for Iran to make concessions to demonstrate that its nuclear program is peaceful. They also said that they would vote for the legislation only if Iran failed to reach an agreement on a political framework “that addresses all parameters of a comprehensive agreement.” Negotiating teams had set June 30 as a deadline for concluding talks on technicalities of a comprehensive deal. Despite promising to hold off on a vote, the senators expressed doubts about Iran’s intentions. “We remain deeply skeptical that Iran is committed to making the concessions required to demonstrate to the world that its nuclear program is exclusively peaceful by March 24 â the deadline agreed upon for a political framework agreement,” they wrote. “Considering Iranâs history in nuclear negotiations and after two extensions of the joint plan of action, we are concerned that Iran is intentionally extending the negotiations to improve its leverage at the negotiating table.” Here is David E. Sanger’s article in today’s Times about American and Iranian lawmakers who are looking to influence negotiations. By DAVID E.

Iran’s Foreign Minister Warns of Unlimited Atomic Fuel Enrichment if Talks on Final Agreement Fail	Advertisement Supported by By  Iran’s foreign minister raised the prospect on Friday of unlimited Iranian atomic fuel enrichment if the final phase of talks with the United States and other big powers on Iran’s disputed nuclear program does not achieve an agreement by a June 30 deadline, with all sanctions dropped. The foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, also said the Americans had diverged from a on April 2 by publishing what they described as a fact sheet about the framework’s basic provisions. Contrary to that assertion, Mr. Zarif said, there would be no phased removal of sanctions to ensure Iranian compliance. American and Iranian officials are using different words to describe elements of the preliminary agreement to limit Iran’s nuclear program. “The United States for their own domestic reasons, and that’s their right and prerogative, produced a fact sheet, which was not exactly what we adopted,” Mr. Zarif . It was his first extensive interview with a Western news organization since the framework agreement was reached in Lausanne, Switzerland. Iran has been subjected to a litany of economic and financial sanctions over the years — from the United Nations Security Council, the United States and the European Union — over uranium enrichment and other nuclear activities. The framework agreement would curb those activities and provide guarantees that Iran’s nuclear program was peaceful in exchange for the removal of the sanctions, which have deeply hurt the Iranian economy. While Iranian officials have always asserted that their program is peaceful — and Mr. Zarif did so again in the Euronews interview — the language he used about a possible failure to reach a final agreement was unusually blunt. As Iran and world powers including the United States try to reach a deal on nuclear controls in exchange for the lifting of sanctions, Iranians from all walks of life are watching and hoping for a new start. “We’ve said from the beginning that we need to choose the path,” he said, speaking in English. “We can have the path of confrontation or we can have the path of cooperation. We cannot have a little bit of each. If we take the path of confrontation, the United States and the United Nations will continue with their sanctions, and Iran will continue with its enrichment program. Without any limitations.” Mr. Zarif’s interview was the second strong public pushback against the United States this week over the remaining challenges to resolving the nuclear dispute. On Wednesday, Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, worked out between the Obama administration and Congress that gave American lawmakers a greater voice on terms of a final deal. Iran, Mr. Rouhani said, was negotiating with a group of six countries — the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council plus Germany — not just the United States. Last week Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, who has the final word on Iran’s nuclear activities, said any final agreement must end all sanctions on the day that a pact is signed. video Advertisement
None	The best thing that can be said about the 98-1 on Thursday was that it did not make a flawed bill any worse. Republicans who are determined to sabotage the emerging nuclear agreement between Iran and the major powers wanted to pile on a number of problematic amendments but debate on them was precluded because of party infighting. The bill sets the procedures for Congress to review â and possibly vote on â the agreement, which would have Iran curb its nuclear program in return for a lifting of international sanctions. It would prohibit President Obama from waiving economic sanctions on Iran â the crucial element of any agreement under which Iran rolls back its nuclear program â for at least 30 days, and up to 52 days, after signing an agreement so Congress has time to weigh in. The legislation was the product of compromise among senators who are viscerally opposed to any deal with Iran and those who made an institutional argument that Congress must have a role in such an important agreement. The measure now goes to the House of Representatives, where passage is considered certain. In theory, the legislation creates new and potentially dangerous uncertainties for the nuclear agreement, which is supposed to be completed by June 30 and offers the best chance of restraining an Iranian program that had become a serious threat. But a letter sent to Mr. Obama by 150 House Democrats on Thursday was a welcome hint that Congress may not be able to kill a nuclear deal after all, no matter how hard the opponents are trying. In the letter, the lawmakers express strong support for the negotiations and the interim political framework that was announced last month. They urge Mr. Obama to âstay on courseâ towards a strong and verifiable final agreement and, taking implied aim at opponents who have raised the prospect of military action against Iran, declare that âwar itself will not make us safe.â The number and nature of the signatories is key, representing one-third of the members of the House and including Jewish members and Democratic leaders. That suggests there may be enough support in the House to prevent Congress from disapproving a final deal and from sustaining a disapproval vote over Mr. Obamaâs certain veto. The problem is that if Congress gets to the point of taking a vote of disapproval, that could cause Iran and the world to question Americaâs commitment to a final agreement, a potentially disastrous outcome if the deal is sound and verifiable.

Iran’s Leaders Fall Into Line Behind Nuclear Accord	Advertisement Supported by By  TEHRAN — Since the Islamic Revolution in 1979, Iranian hard-liners have been free to take to the streets and object to any form of compromise with the West, and particularly the United States. But when a conspicuously small group of hard-liners did so on Tuesday morning in front of the Parliament building, holding up placards and shouting slogans against the nuclear framework agreed to last week in Lausanne, Switzerland, the Iranian Interior Ministry condemned the demonstration as illegal, because the protesters had failed to obtain a permit. There were also very few reporters. It was perhaps the first time that conservatives — in this case mostly young people genuinely disappointed over the compromises has made to reach a nuclear agreement — seemed disconnected from the power structure here. Analysts say the message from the top is clear: Get with the program. Senior officials, important clerics, lawmakers and Revolutionary Guards commanders, who in the past have reflexively opposed any accommodation with the West, now go out of their way to laud Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and his team of negotiators, as well as the government of President Hassan Rouhani. On Tuesday, Gen. Mohammad Ali Jafari, the highest-ranking commander of the Corps, joined the chorus. “The Iranian nation and the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps thank these dear negotiators for their honest attempts and political jihad, and for their resistance on the defined red lines,” the semiofficial Mehr news agency quoted him as saying. One influential cleric even issued a statement to correct a quote attributed to him that suggested he had been slightly critical of the nuclear framework. “Unfortunately, these remarks are lies attributed to him,” the office of Ayatollah Naser Marakem Shirazi hastily made clear. American and Iranian officials are using different words to describe elements of the preliminary agreement to limit Iran’s nuclear program. Only one man had remained silent: Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader, whose word is always the last. However, analysts say the broad support among conservatives is almost certainly a reflection of his thinking. Hamidreza Taraghi, a political analyst close to Ayatollah Khamenei, said it should not be surprising that Iran’s establishment had closed ranks behind the negotiators and the talks. “Wherever Foreign Minister Zarif goes to explain about the negotiations, his arguments are convincing and accepted,” he said. “Of course, we worry about some details, but they will be hammered out and solved, we are sure.” On Tuesday, Mr. Zarif earned glowing praise after he paid a visit to Parliament to describe the nuclear framework and answer lawmakers’ questions. Outside were the 150 or so hard-line demonstrators. “We are the voice of the people,” one of the protesters said. “We are worried over this deal.” But some people passing by had different ideas. “Go home,” someone yelled from a car window. “Drink the chalice of poison,” another shouted, a reference to a remark by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the former leader of Iran, describing his bitter feelings upon signing a cease-fire after eight bloody years of war with Iraq. “The people can swear at us,” said Vahid Aziz, an engineering student who held up a placard saying “We Are Worried.” They can swear, he said, because Iran is a democracy. “We also have the right to say something.” A guide to help you navigate the deal between global powers and Tehran. But their opinion seems to be a minority one. In a poll conducted by the pro-government IRNA news agency, 96 percent of people in Tehran were found to support the nuclear deal. Opinion polls in Iran are notoriously unreliable, but the news agency insisted that 83 percent of the respondents “expressed happiness, hope and relief on hearing about the nuclear agreement achieved in Lausanne, Switzerland.” For those who have long lived under the enforced opinions of minority groups, like Nader Karimi Joni, a former member of the paramilitary Basij organization who is now an activist and journalist, the progress in the nuclear talks is a vindication. “These people protesting the deal are a small, doomed group of losers who do not understand that the perceptions of the establishment have changed,” he said. “They can shout ‘Death to America’ all they want, but nobody in the government or in the establishment is in the mood for these sorts of actions.” Iran’s interior minister, Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli, issued a warning that henceforth no illegal gatherings would be allowed. “Those who are ‘worried’ or ‘not-worried,’ they all need a permit to protest so we can guarantee their security,” he told the Arman newspaper. But one of the organizers of the gathering, a 26-year-old student named Ali Mataji, said protest was necessary, “because we have the right to ask questions.” He added: “We will not stop, as there is a deviation of the national interests in the nuclear issue.” Outside the Parliament building, a passer-by started a discussion with Mr. Aziz, the engineering student. “Why don’t you wait with your criticism until the deal is more clear?” the man asked. “We need to bring awareness,” Mr. Aziz responded, waving his placard. The man shook his head, telling the protester, “Your actions are weakening the talks.” Advertisement
Fates of 3 Americans Held in Iran Remain Hazy Despite Diplomatic Progress	Advertisement Supported by By  The families of three American citizens of Iranian descent who are incarcerated in Iran, one of them held for more than three and a half years, have been hoping that the success of diplomacy on the nuclear dispute would herald their releases as good-will gestures. But the fates of the three — Jason Rezaian, 39, Saeed Abedini, 34, and Amir Hekmati, 31 — remained just as hazy as they had ever been on Friday, a day after the framework agreement was reached. They were barely mentioned in the initial flurry of news announcements on the framework agreement which, when finalized, would limit Iran’s nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief, and portend an end to the country’s prolonged isolation. Secretary of State John Kerry, after the announcement of an agreement at talks in Lausanne, Switzerland, was asked about the three Americans almost immediately and offered little in the way of an update except to reiterate the Obama administration’s determination to secure their freedom. “We have a very specific process in place to try to deal with it,” Mr. Kerry said. “And we call on Iran again today, now, in light of this, to release these Americans and let them get home with their families. And we’re working on that, and we will continue to be very focused on it.” Families of the three Americans, who have become increasingly vocal to raise public awareness, expressed appreciation of Mr. Kerry’s statement. But they could barely hide their frustration and disappointment. The family of Mr. Rezaian, a Washington Post correspondent and California native who has been imprisoned without publicly revealed charges since July 20, issued a challenging Iranian officials to follow their own laws and international human rights commitments. “Jason has been held more than twice as long as any prior Western journalist, and with no evidence that Iran is willing to claim justifies their actions,” said Mr. Rezaian’s brother Ali. “All Iran has said is that ‘it’s complicated.’ Now that a framework agreement has been announced, things should be less ‘complicated.’ ” Mr. Hekmati, a Marine veteran from Flint, Mich., who was arrested while visiting relatives in August 2011, was originally sentenced to death on an espionage conviction that was later overturned. He was convicted of the lesser charge of aiding a hostile country — meaning the United States — and sentenced to 10 years. He has repeatedly asserted his innocence, accused the Iranian penal authorities of mistreatment and described himself as a political prisoner. “Now that Iran has sat at the table next to the United States, working diligently to come to an agreement for a nuclear program, we ask Iran if they still consider the United States a hostile country and if they do not, perhaps it is time they open the prison gates and allow the Red Cross to visit Amir without guard and report on the status of his well-being,” his family in a statement. Mr. Abedini, of Boise, Idaho, was sentenced in 2013 to eight years in prison on charges of disturbing national security by creating a private network of churches. The American Center for Law and Justice, an advocacy group that represents his family, that with the achievement of a framework nuclear deal, “it is critical that our government use this unique opportunity — as our two nations continue to sit at the negotiating table over the next few weeks and months — to bring Pastor Saeed and the other wrongfully imprisoned Americans home to their families.” Advertisement
European Leaders Criticize Trump’s Disavowal of Iran Deal	Advertisement Supported by By  and LONDON — Iran, Russia and European leaders roundly condemned President Trump’s decision on Friday to disavow the , saying that it reflected the growing isolation of the United States, threatened to destabilize the Middle East and could make it harder to resolve the growing tensions on the Korean Peninsula. The reaction was far from panicked, as Mr. Trump’s decision punts to Congress the critical decision of whether the United States will reimpose sanctions on Iran — a step that would effectively sink the deal. But Mr. Trump also warned that unless the nuclear agreement was altered and made permanent — to prohibit Iran from ever developing nuclear weapons — he would terminate the agreement, an ultimatum that threw the future of the accord into question. Though they avoided direct criticism of Mr. Trump, Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Emmanuel Macron of France said in a rare joint statement that they “stand committed” to the 2015 nuclear deal and that preserving it was “in our shared national security interest.” “The nuclear deal was the culmination of 13 years of diplomacy and was a major step towards ensuring that Iran’s nuclear program is not diverted for military purposes,” they added. Sigmar Gabriel, Germany’s foreign minister, said that Mr. Trump was sending “a difficult and also from our point of view dangerous signal.” He said that the Iran deal, and other diplomatic achievements, were necessary “to convince countries like North Korea, and maybe also others, that it is possible to create security without acquiring nuclear weapons.” “Destroying this agreement would, worldwide, mean that others could no longer rely on such agreements — that’s why it is a danger that goes further than Iran,” he added. Reaction from Iran was quick and pointed. Appearing on television, its president, Hassan Rouhani, denounced Mr. Trump and called the United States an outlier that had become “more lonely than ever” in the international community. Mr. Rouhani did not threaten to withdraw from the deal, but made it clear that he would not renegotiate the terms, either. “The statements of Mr. Trump are nothing but abuse and threats against the people of Iran,” he said. “An international agreement cannot be disregarded.” The European leaders noted that the United Nations Security Council had unanimously endorsed the deal, and that the International Atomic Energy Agency had confirmed Iran’s compliance with it. But Mr. Trump’s aggressive stance on Iran won plaudits from several nations on Friday, specifically from adversaries of Iran like Israel, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister who has always opposed the agreement with Iran, said that Mr. Trump’s announcement created “an opportunity to fix this bad deal” and was a sign of Mr. Trump’s determination to “boldly confront Iran’s terrorist regime.” Saudi Arabia, which has waged a proxy battle against Iran for supremacy in the region and was the first country Mr. Trump visited after taking office, said it welcomed what it called a “new U.S. strategy” toward Iran. The United Arab Emirates, which like Saudi Arabia is a predominantly Sunni Muslim country with a sizable Shiite minority, also said that it “fully supports” Mr. Trump’s stance on Iran. Some leaders declared that the deal, reached in 2015 between Iran and six world powers, including the United States, was not something that Mr. Trump could cancel, contending that Mr. Trump was essentially putting on a show for his political base. “The president of the United States has many powers — not this one,” the European Union’s top diplomat, Federica Mogherini, said at a news conference in Brussels. She said that there had been no violations of the agreement and that the world could not afford to dismantle an accord that “is working and delivering,” especially at a time of “acute nuclear threat,” referring to the standoff with North Korea over its nuclear program. Criticism of the nuclear deal was a central theme of Mr. Trump’s candidacy for president, and he has repeatedly called for what he sees as a fatally flawed agreement. Mr. Trump said on Friday that under the current deal “Iran can sprint” toward the development of nuclear weapons when the deal’s restrictions expire. Some of the prohibitions in the agreement are set to end in 2025, including limits on the number of its centrifuges. Iran, which has always maintained that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, not for weapons, would not agree to a permanent freeze in its ability to enrich nuclear fuel. That must be changed, Mr. Trump said, or he would scrap the deal altogether. Russia, which took part in the negotiations to reach the accord and has warned Mr. Trump not to rescind it, said that the president had no basis for disavowing the deal. “Iran is abiding” by the nuclear agreement, Mikhail Ulyanov, a director at the Russian foreign ministry, told the Interfax news agency. “Everyone agrees with that. And an attempt to somehow heighten the tensions in this situation looks like unmotivated aggression.” In blunt language, Ms. Mogherini, the European Union’s top diplomat, essentially looked past Mr. Trump and appealed to Congress directly. America’s next step “is now in the hands of the United States Congress,” she said. “The international community and the European Union with it has clearly indicated that the deal is and will continue to be in place.” Russia urged American lawmakers to preserve the deal as well. “We want to hope that Congress will not take any dramatic steps which would effectively signify a collapse” of the deal, Russia’s deputy foreign minister told Interfax, referring to the renewed sanctions that might lead Iran to nullify the accord. In his remarks, Mr. Trump accused Iran of violating both the letter and the spirit of the accord. But Iran has accused the United States of doing the same, and on Friday its mission to the United Nations warned that Iran might itself back away from the deal. “Iran has many options on how to proceed and if necessary will terminate its commitment regarding this issue,” the mission said in a statement, without elaborating. Iran has also resisted the idea of renegotiating the nuclear agreement in the West’s favor. Last month, its foreign minister rejected extending the length or conditions of the accord, saying that Iran would consider changing the agreement only if the concessions it had already made — including giving up nuclear fuel — were reconsidered. There are fears that the basic framework of the accord could collapse if the United States walks away. Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, told reporters on Friday that Russia believed Iran would abandon the deal if the United States did. Stephen Castle reported from London, and Thomas Erdbrink from Dallas. Reporting was contributed by Victor Homola from Berlin, Sophia Kishkovsky from Moscow and Daphné Anglès and Liam Stack from Paris. Opinion Opinion Advertisement
Mr. Obama, Try These Arguments for Your Iran Deal	Advertisement Supported by By  It would be a catastrophe for American influence in the world if Congress killed the Iranian nuclear deal. Perhaps because the stakes are so high, the debate has become poisonous. Critics are (ludicrously) of appealing to anti-Semitic tropes. And Obama that some opponents were “alarmist,” “ignorant,” “not being straight” and “making common cause” with Iranians who chant “Death to America.” Obama’s rhetoric was counterproductive. As former Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Texas Republican, told me, “At this point, the president has made it impossible for a Republican to vote for it.” Constituent calls to congressional offices are overwhelmingly against the deal, and with Senator Chuck Schumer by opposing it, the opposition is more bipartisan than the support is. That’s tragic, for killing the deal would infuriate many allies, isolate America rather than Iran and ultimately increase the risk of ayatollahs with nuclear weapons. why I’m strongly in favor of the deal, and I urge President Obama to start over with his sales job and focus on three points. The great majority of arms experts support the deal, some enthusiastically, some grudgingly. They recognize shortcomings, but on balance, as 29 of America’s leading nuclear scientists and arms experts last week, it has “much more stringent constraints than any previously negotiated nonproliferation framework.” Likewise, three dozen retired American released declaring the deal “the most effective means currently available to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons.” Iran would go from maybe a few months from a bomb to a year away. The agreement doesn’t solve the underlying problem, but it may buy us 15 years. Yes, it would be nice if Iran gave up all its enriched uranium. But isn’t it better that it than that it give up none? Everyone knows Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel , but not everyone realizes other Israelis with far more security expertise support it. Ami Ayalon, former head of Israel’s Shin Bet security service, as “the best possible alternative.” And Efraim Halevy, former head of the Mossad, , “What is the point of canceling an agreement that distances Iran from the bomb?” Critics sometimes note that President Bill Clinton reached an agreement on nuclear weapons with North Korea in 1994, only to see North Korea cheat. The lesson they draw is that it’s pointless to negotiate with untrustworthy rogue regimes. I’ve covered North Korea since I was a young reporter in Asia in the 1980s, and the lesson is actually more like the opposite. That 1994 agreement was indeed flawed, and North Korea violated it. But even so, in the was in place, North Korea , according to American intelligence estimates. After the deal collapsed in 2002, the Bush administration turned to a policy of confrontation, and North Korea then made perhaps nine nuclear weapons. I asked David Petraeus, retired four-star general and former head of the C.I.A., about that. “I strongly believe,” he told me, “that there will continue to be a viable military option should Iran seek to break out and construct a nuclear device after the expiration of many of the elements of the inspections regime at the 15-year mark of the agreement.” To me, this deal is ugly and flawed — and infinitely better than the alternatives. The criticisms of the deal strike me as reasonable, but the alternatives that the critics propose seem unreasonable and incoherent. So President Obama should hit the restart button. He should acknowledge that the deal has shortcomings but also emphasize that it must be judged not by a referendum on its terms but rather as a choice: deal or no deal. He can also take steps to reassure doubters. We could boost funding for the International Atomic Energy Agency to make oversight more effective. We could do more to speak up for human rights in Iran and to counter Iranian meddling in the region, especially in Syria. Gen. Brent Scowcroft, the patriarch of Republican security experts, tells me that he supports the Iran deal in part because it exemplifies American leadership on a crucial global issue. I agree, and for Congress to kill it will not just set back American leadership, it will also increase the odds that Iran gets the bomb. Gail Collins is on book leave.

Skeptical of Iran Nuclear Deal, Israel Calls for Changes	Advertisement Supported by By  and JERUSALEM — Clearly unsatisfied with assurances from President Obama about the provisions of the nuclear deal, on Monday listed specific requirements that it declared were necessary in any final agreement. The list, produced by Yuval Steinitz, Israel’s minister of intelligence and strategic affairs and one of the Israeli government’s harshest critics of the negotiations, marked a change in direction for the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Until now, Israel has argued, at least publicly, that the only good deal would halt all uranium enrichment by Iran, essentially rolling back the clock by 20 years. It has never before defined the “better deal” that Mr. Netanyahu told Congress the world needed. But Mr. Steinitz’s list of desired modifications for the final agreement, due to be concluded by June 30, appeared carefully designed to echo some of the more sophisticated critiques of the agreement that have circulated since the United States described critical elements of the deal on Thursday. Israeli policy makers have grappled for some time with the question of whether to stick, at least publicly, to Israel’s maximalist demands, even though they appeared increasingly out of sync with the reality of a negotiation that clearly was going to require concessions on all sides. American and Iranian officials are using different words to describe elements of the preliminary agreement to limit Iran’s nuclear program. Before the details of the framework were made known, some Israeli officials feared that showing any flexibility might be interpreted as a green light by the Obama administration to engage in further give and take, precluding a more nuanced approach. Mr. Steinitz’s tone was a bit different, saying the changes — including some restraints American negotiators had attempted unsuccessfully to obtain in past negotiations — would make the accord “more reasonable.” But the Obama administration fears that reopening the issues with Iran in the last stages of the talks would invite it to do the same, rapidly unraveling the deal. So far, the administration has shown no inclination to relitigate some of the most contentious issues that have been argued over for the last two years, culminating in eight days of intense negotiation at a hotel in Lausanne, Switzerland, on the banks of Lake Geneva. But Mr. Steinitz said that the suggestion that there was no alternative to the framework, or that Israel had not put forward an alternative, “is wrong.” “The alternative is not necessarily to declare war on Iran,” he said, briefing international reporters at a Jerusalem hotel. “It is to increase pressure on Iran and stand firm and make Iran make serious concessions and have a much better deal.” The Lausanne framework calls on Iran to limit enrichment of uranium at its Natanz facility to a level useful only for civilian purposes, drastically cut its fuel stockpile and cut back the number of installed centrifuges by about two-thirds. It would convert the underground Fordo facility into a research center, but would be barred from enriching there. Iran would also modify its Arak heavy water reactor to drastically reduce its output of plutonium, another path to a bomb. In exchange, the United States and other nations would lift sanctions that have constrained the Iranian economy. President Obama said the sanctions would be lifted only after Iran had delivered on its commitments regarding Fordo, the centrifuges and other issues, although he said there were details still to be worked out. The Israeli list of additions to the framework includes the following:  An end to all research and development activity on advanced centrifuges in Iran. The Lausanne framework, as described by the United States, leaves unclear what kind of work Iran will conduct. But it is a worry to American and Israeli officials because Iran will be readying to deploy the much more efficient centrifuges as soon as the major limitations on uranium production end, in 2030.  A significant reduction in the number of centrifuges that are operational or that can quickly become operational if Iran breaks the agreement and decides to build a bomb. The accord allows about 5,000 to operate for the first decade at the main plant at Natanz, roughly half the number spinning today.  The closing of the as an enrichment site, even if enrichment activities are suspended there. This was also an early United States objective. The compromise struck allows a small number of centrifuges to spin but bars the enrichment of uranium there; instead, other elements will be created for medical isotopes.  Iranian compliance in revealing its past activities with “possible military dimensions.” It is unclear from the wording of the American statement if Iran must completely answer a dozen questions posed by the International Atomic Energy Agency — 11 of which it has declined to answer so far — before it would receive full sanctions relief.  A commitment to ship its stockpile of enriched uranium out of Iran. Iran said last week that it would not ship the stockpile out of the country, but the American statement left open the possibility of sending it abroad or diluting it in Iran.  “Anywhere, anytime” access for inspectors charged with verifying the agreement in Iran. The inspection regime falls short of this, but sets up some kind of mechanism — the details of which are unclear — to resolve disputes if Iran blocks inspection of a suspected site. The reaction from Israel came after that the preliminary agreement was the “best bet by far” to prevent Tehran from obtaining a nuclear weapon and his pledge to the Israelis that the United States had “got their backs.” The disagreements between Israel and the Obama administration over the Iran talks have severely strained the American-Israeli relationship in recent months, with the . The White House was infuriated by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s decision to address a joint meeting of Congress in March without consulting the White House. Despite Mr. Obama’s more conciliatory tone toward Israel in recent days, Israel has made it clear that it intends to keep up the pressure. On Sunday, Mr. Netanyahu appeared on ABC’s “This Week,” CNN’s “State of the Union” and NBC News’s “Meet the Press,” where he said: “I’m not trying to kill any deal. I’m trying to kill a bad deal.” Yet Israel’s former intelligence chiefs have been more welcoming. Efraim Halevy, a former head of Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency, suggested that those in Israel who have been critical of Mr. Obama should change their tone. Mr. Halevy told Israel’s Army Radio on Monday that “in order to influence you have to act with a certain kind of respect for your partner.” Adel al-Jubeir, Saudi Arabia’s ambassador in Washington, echoed the Saudi cabinet of ministers in expressing hope that the final deal in June would prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. A guide to help you navigate the deal between global powers and Tehran. He would not say whether the agreement announced by the United States last week had gone far enough toward meeting that goal. “I don’t know because the details have not been worked out.” he said. “There are a number of areas where, I think, more clarification needs to take place.” On Monday in Jerusalem, Mr. Steinitz, the minister of intelligence and strategic affairs, said Israel would be making further efforts to persuade the Obama administration and Congress, as well as Britain, France, Russia and other world powers, “not to sign this bad deal or at least to dramatically change or fix it.” Referring to , a New York Times columnist, Mr. Steinitz said it was “not good enough.” It was unsatisfactory, Mr. Steinitz said, because of the time required to refer suspicions to a committee, and because no nation would want to expose sensitive intelligence data to a committee that included an Iranian presence. But Mr. Steinitz said the Israeli government had conducted a “sober analysis” of the agreement and was raising questions, including why the framework does not address Iran’s intercontinental ballistic missile program, which it says threatens the United States. The negotiation has never included Iran’s missile capability. As Mr. Steinitz was outlining his government’s position, the White House said it was actively seeking out supporters of Israel in its intensive effort to build support for the agreement. “This is a deliberate attempt to make the case to individuals who are concerned about the security of Israel that going along with an agreement like this that would prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon isn’t just in the best national security interests of the United States, which it is, it’s also clearly in the best interests of the nation of Israel,” said Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary. “That will be an important part of our case moving forward.” Isabel Kershner reported from Jerusalem, and David E.

None	Republicans have been criticizing President Obamaâs nuclear deal with Iran, but those with longer memories recall that it was one of their own who set the United States on the path toward negotiations. Nine years ago, President George W. Bush agreed to join Europeans at the negotiating table with Iran. , the conditions were that Iran must suspend uranium activities for talks to engage about halting its nuclear program in exchange for economic and political benefits. âItâs conceptually a deep irony because this diplomatic outreach was originally designed and engineered by President Bush,â said Philip Zelikow, a University of Virginia professor who was a deputy to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in Mr. Bushâs administration. âItâs convenient for Republicans and Democrats to forget this.â Mr. Zelikow said that there was intense debate within the Bush administration at the time over whether to engage Iran and that ultimately talks failed when its leadership had a change of heart. Itâs hard to know how Mr. Bush would have handled this round of negotiations with Iran, Mr. Zelikow surmised, because Iranâs nuclear capabilities have progressed since the previous administration. Stephen Hadley, a former foreign policy adviser to Mr. Bush, said that he thinks the Bush administration would have been wary of allowing Iran to retain the ability to enrich uranium, as the current deal does, but that perhaps a symbolic amount might have been allowed in the final negotiations. But, he said, looking past Iranâs other misdeeds would have been a problem. âPeople say how can you negotiate with the Iranians on the nuclear issue and not on the other things theyâre doing,â Mr. Hadley said, alluding to, among other things, its support of groups like Hezbollah. âIâm confident that the Bush administration would have done something to find a broader framework to deal with Iranâs negative activities.â One former adviser to Mr. Bush was less confident in how he would have handled the situation. John Bolton, the foreign policy hawk who was his ambassador to the United Nations, said the pressure to get something done might have made such a deal move forward. âI donât know, I would have to worry about the constant dripping of water on a stone from the State Department and the Europeans wanting to negotiate,â said Mr. Bolton, who remains steadfast that engagement with Iran is a bad idea. âItâs a dark day for the republic, I must say.â First Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

North Korea’s Real Lessons for Iran	Advertisement Supported by Op-Ed Contributors By  and PRESIDENT OBAMA’S defense of his emerging nuclear deal with Iran as a “once in a lifetime opportunity” reminds his critics of an earlier landmark agreement, intended to end the threat of a nuclear-armed North Korea. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and others have argued that the eventual collapse of that agreement, resulting in North Korea’s building nuclear weapons, proves that a deal with Tehran is a big mistake. Those of us who negotiated the North Korea deal know that important lessons can be learned from that experience. But they are not the ones based on the critics’ fundamental misreading of history. Faced with the prospect of a hostile, nuclear-armed North Korea in 1994, the Clinton administration reached a deal that required the North to give up its weapons program in return for energy assistance, the lifting of sanctions and better relations with the United States. In the late 1990s, however, we caught the North Koreans cheating and, early in the George W. Bush administration, the agreement collapsed. Today, the North’s reinvigorated bomb program may be poised, as Mr. Netanyahu pointed out in his recent speech to Congress, to produce as many as 100 nuclear weapons over the next five years. Although our policy ultimately failed, the agreement did not. Without the 1994 deal, North Korea would have built the bomb sooner, stockpiled weapons more quickly and amassed a much larger arsenal by now. Intelligence estimates in the early 1990s concluded that the North’s nuclear program was so advanced that it could produce 30 Nagasaki-size nuclear weapons a year by the end of the decade. More than 20 years later, that still hasn’t happened. The collapse of the North Korea deal has been used to argue that it is impossible to conduct diplomacy with rogue states. But the only litmus test that matters is whether an agreement serves our national interest, is better than having no deal at all, and is preferable to military force. The arrangement with Iran appears to be well on its way to meeting that standard. The real lessons from North Korea have to do with why a deal with such a promising start ultimately collapsed. While reaching an agreement is tough, making it stick is even tougher. The United States and its partners must avoid the “problem solved” mentality that inevitably follows landmark agreements. This mentality took hold in 1994 as senior officials moved on to deal with other foreign policy challenges while implementation, left in the hands of lower-level bureaucrats, suffered. As a result, the United States didn’t follow through on two major incentives it had promised in return for North Korea’s nuclear restraint: the establishment of better political relations and the lifting of economic sanctions. This does not excuse the North’s behavior, but it does show these deals require constant attention. The Iran framework is extraordinarily complex, and will require monitoring to ensure that all the moving pieces — limiting Iran’s nuclear capabilities, providing for inspections and lifting sanctions — are effectively implemented. One way to do this is for the United States and its partners to establish a body that meets regularly to oversee implementation. Another lesson is that we should not be surprised if Tehran is caught cheating. While the Obama administration has emphasized the emerging agreement’s highly intrusive verification measures, the trick will be not only to catch cheating in a timely manner, but also to react with a clear plan. We failed to do that with North Korea. When the Bush administration confronted the North about its cheating in 2002, the North simply withdrew from the agreement and restarted its nuclear program. Having just gone to war in Afghanistan and about to invade Iraq, the administration decided to start from scratch and seek new nuclear negotiations that dragged on and eventually petered out. In hindsight, President Bush could have followed the Clinton administration’s plan to confront North Korea with an opportunity rather than an accusation. That meant offering the North more progress in building better relations in return for stopping its threatening activities, including its cheating. For Iran, we need a mechanism for resolving disputes and a plan for political, economic and possibly military steps to deal with violations that we and our partners have agreed on beforehand. Finally, we should understand that without a positive shift in political relations, the chances that a nuclear deal will fail increase over time. We included provisions in the 1994 accord for improving relations between the United States and North Korea, but failed to recognize that four decades of hostility could not be erased overnight. Continuing tensions on issues unrelated to the nuclear agreement helped undermine the deal. The same danger exists with Iran, given its hostility to American and Israeli interests in the Middle East. Of course, North Korea and Iran are very different politically; Tehran, along with hard-liners, has a young and increasingly vocal reform movement. That may be reason for hope. But whether that difference will translate into future moderation in Iranian foreign policy remains uncertain. As American negotiators move toward a final agreement with Iran by the end of June, they are right to look to our experience with North Korea. But they should ignore the critics who say that the lesson is to abandon diplomacy. Diplomacy can succeed with political will and sustained focus. We just need to remember that the deal itself is only the beginning.  , a professor of diplomacy at Georgetown University, was the chief negotiator for the 1994 nuclear deal with North Korea. , a senior fellow at the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins, was the coordinator for the deal from 1995 to 1999.

Too Important to Slip Away	Advertisement Supported by Editorial By  Deciding to extend negotiations on Iran’s nuclear program until June 2015, as the various parties have done, is far better than allowing the process to collapse. There is no sensible alternative to a diplomatic solution, and the major powers must continue to press Iran toward that goal. But the lengthy extension is worrying for anyone committed to a peaceful resolution of this protracted and dangerous nuclear issue. Negotiators for Iran and the major powers — the United States, Britain, France, Russia, China and Germany — failed even to agree on a framework for a comprehensive deal, which is aimed at guaranteeing that Iran never produces a nuclear weapon in return for a lifting of international sanctions. The next seven months could be perilous. As the negotiators seek an agreement that has eluded them over the past year, they will also have to guard against the hard-liners — in the United States, Iran and Israel — who have been gaining strength and now have more time to try to kill a deal. These hard-liners are primed for the fight. After Iran and the major powers missed their Monday deadline to conclude negotiations, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee said it was “essential” for Congress to impose new sanctions on Iran. More sanctions may be appropriate at some point but definitely not now. New sanctions could empower Iran’s hard-liners, give Tehran an excuse to walk away from negotiations and split the coalition of major powers. And they could also cause Iran to move toward producing a nuclear bomb, the outcome this whole negotiating exercise is intended to prevent. For nearly a year, Iran has adhered to an interim agreement that froze and rolled back its program, which includes some 19,000 centrifuge machines for enriching uranium that can be used in energy production or bombs. As the negotiations continue, those limits remain in place and Iran will continue to receive limited sanctions relief that has brought the country about $700 million per month in money that was frozen abroad. But endless negotiations are not a sustainable solution. Advertisement
None	Advertisement        President Obama’s View Sanctions will be lifted in a phased approach, only after Iran lives up to its commitments under the agreement. Israel’s Impression The deal removes sanctions “almost immediately” and makes Iranian compliance “unlikely.”   Iran’s View Iran has maintained that the deal will not require inspections of military bases. Mr. Khamenei, above, reiterated that inspections of military facilities would not be permitted. Critics Say Critics of the deal, like Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and Senator John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, insist that inspectors be allowed to go “anywhere” in Iran, at “anytime.”   Iran’s Emphasis More than 1,000 of the centrifuges will be kept at Fordo, and modifications could be reversed if the United States does not hold up its end of the deal. Above, President Hassah Rouhani. Israel and McCain Want the facility to be closed completely.   Israeli Skepticism Israel questions the effectiveness of this mechanism.   Iran’s Statement The Iranian statement omits the word “limited.” Change Sought Israel and Mr. McCain want the final agreement to prohibit all research on centrifuges. Advertisement
Beyond Trump’s Korea Fantasies	Advertisement Supported by Editorial By  The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section. Well, that was easy. After a single meeting in Singapore, President Trump has, in his own fantastical telling, “no longer a nuclear threat.” Never mind that North Korea still has as many as 60 nuclear weapons, scores of ballistic missiles and an untold number of facilities that are producing plutonium and enriched uranium. Unfortunately for the president, containing a nuclear power requires more than just one meeting. Negotiating an end to North Korea’s nuclear threat will take deliberation, political courage — and time. The broad outlines of an agreement would be similar to proposals and pacts the United States has developed over the decades to restrain countries with nuclear ambitions: In return for curbing their nuclear programs and allowing international verification, such countries are offered economic, political and security benefits. That was the core of the between the United States and North Korea, which fell apart by 2003; a 2006 proposal to Iran by France, Britain, Germany, Russia, China and the United States that went nowhere; and the far more rigorous 2015 Iran deal that involved the same five powers and that Mr. Trump reneged on. With North Korea, there are two unique complications: It already has an arsenal of nuclear weapons and missiles, including an ICBM that can reach the United States, and the locations of many its nuclear sites are unknown, making verification hard if not impossible. And since Mr. Trump has denounced the Iran deal, with its uniquely intrusive inspections and strict requirements for significantly reducing nuclear fuel and other nuclear-related components, as the “worst ever,” he has set quite a high bar for an accord with North Korea. In fact, he says he is insisting on “complete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearization,” presumably meaning eliminating all of North Korea’s atomic weapons and production facilities. That outcome would be an extraordinary achievement. But Mr. Trump has been known to underdeliver on his grander promises, and no nation with a nuclear program this advanced has ever disarmed so completely. So what would a more plausible yet still positive deal look like? In the Iran deal, Tehran agreed to strict controls on its nuclear program in exchange for economic benefits — sanctions relief. Mr. Trump could seek a broader deal with North Korea by offering wider benefits, not just sanctions relief but also security guarantees and full diplomatic relations. This would allow the administration to pursue curbs on North Korea’s missiles, chemical and biological weapons and technology exports, too. The of Kim Jong-un, “I will guarantee his safety.” That is a ridiculous commitment no president could keep, or want to, since it would have the United States protecting one of the world’s worst human rights abusers. Instead, the administration could promise not to try to overthrow Mr. Kim and could reiterate the pledge the United States made in the 1994 Agreed Framework, to work toward peace on the Korean Peninsula. In exchange, North Korea would curb those other weapons and perhaps resolve the fate of South Korean and Japanese citizens North Korea has abducted. A peace treaty to resolve the Korean War 65 years after an armistice was signed could be considered, if it wouldn’t bog down the nuclear negotiations. Mr. Trump thinks he can snap his fingers and get North Korea to eliminate all its nuclear weapons and facilities. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says to expect “ ” by the end of the president’s first term. Some it could take up to 15 years to fully denuclearize. Many say it’s unrealistic to expect it all. No matter how likely or how drawn out such a grand goal would be, some steps can be taken quickly. As a start, the two sides should agree on a framework for sustained, high-level negotiations, including a definition of denuclearization South-North Joint Declaration as a model. In that agreement the two Koreas committed to limiting nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and not to test, manufacture, receive, store, deploy or use nuclear weapons or nuclear reprocessing and uranium enrichment facilities. North Korea should make its temporary freeze on nuclear and missile testing permanent and allow international inspectors to verify the destruction of the test sites the government claims to have blown up. It could even sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Fissile material production should also be frozen. Even if the process ended there, Mr. Trump would achieve something constructive. If negotiations are successful, even more so than some think possible, North Korea would eventually begin destroying or removing to another country its fissile material and dismantling weapons and production facilities, providing a comprehensive list of its facilities. Given the nature and breadth of the program, verification by the International Atomic Energy Agency would most likely have to be still more intrusive than the 24/7 system in place in Iran. The administration insists it won’t lift longstanding sanctions on North Korea until denuclearization is done, but no country will give up such leverage without compensation along the way. If Mr. Trump wants a deal, he’s going to have to work out a plan where sanctions are lifted in stages, commensurate with steps taken by North Korea, and can be reversed if North Korea reneges on its commitments. The president also promised unspecified “security guarantees,” and then went overboard by announcing plans to halt joint military exercises with South Korea (without Seoul or the Pentagon) and signaling that at some point he may withdraw the 28,000 from South Korea. Such sensitive and far-reaching decisions should be part of a process, not a unilateral concession. Opening an American interests section — a de facto embassy — in Pyongyang and eventually establishing full normal diplomatic relations should also be part of any agreement. Major national security commitments are stronger and more credible when backed by a bipartisan majority in Congress. If Mr. Trump gets an agreement with North Korea and wants to make sure it survives, he should work with Congress to pass it as a treaty. Advertisement
Sabotaging a Deal with Iran	Advertisement Supported by Op-Ed Contributor By  LONDON — America and Iran took a step toward a final nuclear deal on Jan. 18, but they should be making leaps. The negotiators have proposed some creative solutions but major political compromises are sorely needed, and soon. If a framework agreement can’t be reached in March, the talks could become mired in stalemate. Those who oppose any diplomacy between Iran and the West are already seeking to end the process altogether. With time, they will gain further ammunition. Spoilers have been striking from Tehran, Washington and Tel Aviv. Some are trying to limit the ability of President Barack Obama (or whoever succeeds him) to deliver a reasonable sanctions-relief package to Iran. Others are seeking to corner Iran and force its government into knee-jerk reactions to regional flare-ups. Hard-liners in the United States and Iran see the nuclear negotiations as an opportunity to score points domestically and they are escalating their efforts to scuttle a grand bargain. Although the Obama administration has dedicated itself to multilateral diplomacy with Iran, it has been under constant pressure from Congress. Powerful American legislators, influential lobby groups and the Israeli prime minister have repeatedly called for increased economic pressure on Iran to extract further concessions. Not only does this contradict America’s interest in maintaining the freeze on Iran’s nuclear program, but it also devalues the agreement brokered between Iran and France, Britain, Russia, China, America and Germany. Threats by American lawmakers to impose further sanctions on Iran have already poisoned the spirit of the talks and created doubt among Iranians about whether the United States is able and willing to deliver on its promises. This has provoked hard-liners in Tehran to respond with their own threats that Iran would increase its enrichment capacity should new sanctions pass. During his State of the Union address, President Obama made clear that he would veto any proposals for additional sanctions on Iran. And although officials in Tehran recognize this as a good faith gesture on the part of Mr. Obama, they also remember that a Congressional bill introduced in late 2013 nearly garnered enough support to withstand a similar veto threat. Iranian officials worry that the Obama administration is constitutionally unable to make a durable and ironclad promise of sanctions relief as part of a final deal. With a Republican majority in both chambers of Congress, and House Speaker John Boehner’s invitation to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to address Congress for a third time, Iran fears that Mr. Obama’s veto won’t be enough. At the same time, Iran is at risk of losing the West’s trust. There is a danger that Iran will damage its newfound reputation as a good faith interlocutor by retaliating for the presumed Israeli attack that killed Hezbollah operatives and an Iranian general in Syria last Sunday. Iran believes the strike was a premeditated Israeli operation targeting a high-level Iranian official. Influential hardliners in Tehran’s security establishment view it as an act of aggression by Israel and demand a direct response. But any such retaliation, either overtly by Iran or covertly through Hezbollah, would likely prompt Israel’s European and American allies to halt the nuclear negotiations altogether — especially if the retaliation involves attacks against civilians. The Iranian government must decide how openly it wishes to involve itself in the inevitable Hezbollah retaliation while ensuring its tactics do not threaten Iran’s long-term strategic objective of securing a nuclear deal. Iran prudently avoided any entanglement in the Gaza conflict over the summer — and it should continue to keep its distance. If Tehran responds excessively, or if operations are carried out unofficially by Iranian hard-liners, this would escalate the Israeli-Iranian standoff and could derail the nuclear talks completely. March will be an important month for all parties. The results of the Israeli elections could deflate Tel Aviv’s fierce opposition to current negotiations with Iran. For Mr. Netanyahu, blocking any nuclear deal is a personal investment. Some of his political rivals do not necessarily share his fervor on the issue. They view a nuclear deal as less of a threat and place more value on maintaining Israel’s strong alliances with European nations and the United States, all of whom seek a nuclear deal with Iran. If Mr. Netanyahu is defeated by a less hawkish opponent, the Obama administration will have an easier time reassuring Israel about any deal with Iran and there would also be less Israeli pressure on Congress. March is also symbolic for Mr. Rouhani, who is eager to mark the Iranian New Year with a psychological shift on sanctions and engagement with the West. This would be a timely electoral boost for moderates seeking to strengthen their position in the upcoming parliamentary elections. After the negotiations were extended for a second time in November, Mr. Rouhani appealed to the Iranian people, other political factions and Iran’s Supreme Leader for hope and patience. They granted his request but they will not tolerate talks that continue to be extended indefinitely with no tangible sanctions relief in sight. The extension of negotiations has prevented a return to hostile rhetoric between Iran and the West. But tepid progress without any major concessions is a blessing for spoilers, who will use the additional time to sabotage diplomacy. Iran must not allow its short-term ideological pursuits in the region to jeopardize its overarching strategic objective: achieving a comprehensive nuclear deal that brings sanctions relief and provides Iran the option of having a functional relationship with the West. Likewise, the United States must not allow a myopic and obstructionist Congress to derail a deal that is in Washington’s long-term interest and strengthens global security.   Advertisement
The Iran Nuclear Deal: What You Need to Know	Advertisement Supported by By  The announced by Iran, the United States and five other world powers on Thursday was surprisingly specific and placed limits on Tehran’s for the next 15 years. Its central achievement was to reduce Iran’s existing stockpile of nuclear fuel and its capacity to produce new fuel to a level that would ensure it would take at least a year for Iran to manufacture enough fuel for an atomic weapon if it chose to violate the accord. It took two years of negotiations, capped by eight tumultuous days and nights of talks that appeared on the brink of breakdown several times. Negotiators produced a framework for a comprehensive agreement that parties say they intend to draft by June 30. If that final deal is reached and signed, it will be the most significant accord between Iran and major world powers since its Islamic revolution in 1979. • Is allowed to keep its nuclear facilities, which it insists are for civilian uses only, but they would be subject to strict production limits. Two facilities will be converted into research sites without fissile material. • Cuts the number of its centrifuges, which are used to enrich uranium, by two-thirds to 5,060, and reduces its stockpile of low-enriched uranium from 10,000 kilograms to 300 kilograms — not enough for a nuclear weapon — for 15 years. Thousands of centrifuges will be put into storage. A guide to help you navigate the deal between global powers and Tehran. • Agrees to redesign a heavy-water reactor at Arak in a way that would keep it from producing plutonium, a weapons-usable fuel. • Gets relief from a range of international sanctions that have sharply reduced its sale of oil and impeded access to the international financial system. Negotiations over research and development of more advanced centrifuges were particularly difficult. The Iranians won the right to research, but not to use more modern machines for production for the next 10 years. • The timing of sanctions relief. Iran wants all sanctions removed quickly. The United States says sanctions would be removed in stages after Iran shows compliance with the terms of a final nuclear agreement. • The Americans want all nuclear facilities “anywhere in the country,” including military bases, to be subject to inspections that could “investigate suspicious sites or allegations of a covert enrichment facility.” • The process for ensuring Iran remains in compliance with the terms of the agreement and the process for reimposing sanctions if its is found to fall out of compliance. • The details of how Iran’s existing stockpile of nuclear fuel would be diluted, neutralized or removed from the country. American officials say even if Iran breaks the deal, it would not be able to develop enough material for a nuclear weapon for a year, giving the international community time to respond. President Obama insisted that the deal “cuts off every pathway” for Iran to develop a nuclear weapon and establishes the most intrusive inspection system in history. “If Iran cheats,” he said, “the world will know it.” Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, who won the 2013 election promising to , said on that he had congratulated his foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, and the rest of the negotiating team for their “tireless efforts around the clock.” There was no immediate reaction from Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who in recent weeks has emphasized that all Iranians should support the negotiations. There was huge demand within Iran for an end to Western sanctions on the oil and banking sectors. There were celebrations on the streets in some parts of Tehran on Thursday night. But Iranian negotiators will have to overcome significant political objections from hard-liners, the military and scientific establishments. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, the world’s most vocal critic of the emerging agreement, demanded on Friday that as part of a deal. He continues to argue that a deal poses a grave danger to the region and the world. Many leaders in Arab countries also oppose the deal, which comes amid tensions over Iran’s involvement in Yemen, Syria, Iraq and Lebanon. Mr. Obama called King Salman of Saudi Arabia on Friday to reassure the United States’ longtime ally that he remains concerned about “Iran’s destabilizing activities in the region,” and invited the king and other Gulf leaders to Camp David in the spring. Mr. Obama will have a hard time convincing a skeptical Congress, where Republicans and many Democrats are that he has grown so desperate to reach a deal that he is trading away American and Israeli security. He warned Republicans in Congress that if they tried to impose new sanctions to undermine the effort, the United States would be blamed for a diplomatic failure. But if a final agreement is reached, it could reorder America’s relationship with a country that has been an avowed adversary for 36 years, and would define the president’s foreign policy legacy.

29 U.S. Scientists Praise Iran Nuclear Deal in Letter to Obama	Advertisement Supported by By  Twenty-nine of the nation’s top scientists — including Nobel laureates, veteran makers of nuclear arms and former White House science advisers — wrote to on Saturday to praise the deal, calling it innovative and stringent. The letter, from some of the world’s most knowledgeable experts in the fields of and arms control, arrives as Mr. Obama is lobbying Congress, the American public and the nation’s allies to support . The may give the White House arguments a boost after the blow Mr. Obama suffered on Thursday when Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, a Democrat and among the most influential Jewish voices in Congress, , which calls for Iran to curb its and allow inspections in return for an end to international oil and financial sanctions. The first signature on the letter is from Richard L. Garwin, a physicist who helped design the world’s first hydrogen bomb and has long advised Washington on nuclear weapons and arms control. He is among the last living physicists who helped usher in the nuclear age. Also signing is Siegfried S. Hecker, a Stanford professor who, from 1986 to 1997, directed the Los Alamos weapons laboratory in New Mexico, the birthplace of the bomb. The facility produced designs for most of the arms now in the nation’s nuclear arsenal. Other prominent signatories include Freeman Dyson of Princeton, Sidney Drell of Stanford and Rush D. Holt, a physicist and former member of Congress who now leads the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the world’s largest general scientific society. Twenty-nine of the nation’s top scientists wrote to President Obama on Saturday in support of the deal, which calls for Iran to curb its nuclear program and allow inspections in return for an end to sanctions. Most of the 29 who signed the letter are physicists, and many of them have held what the government calls Q clearances — granting access to a special category of secret information that bears on the design of nuclear arms and is considered equivalent to the military’s top secret security clearance. Many of them have advised Congress, the White House or federal agencies over the decades. For instance, Frank von Hippel, a Princeton physicist, served as assistant director for national security in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy during the Clinton administration. The six Nobel laureates who signed are Philip W. Anderson of Princeton University; Leon N. Cooper of Brown University; Sheldon L. Glashow of Boston University; David Gross of the University of California, Santa Barbara; Burton Richter of Stanford University; and Frank Wilczek of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. A guide to help you navigate the deal between global powers and Tehran. The letter uses the words “innovative” and “stringent” more than a half-dozen times, saying, for instance, that the Iran accord has “more stringent constraints than any previously negotiated nonproliferation framework.” “We congratulate you and your team,” the letter says in its opening to Mr. Obama, adding that the Iran deal “will advance the cause of peace and security in the Middle East and can serve as a guidepost for future nonproliferation agreements.” In a technical judgment that seemed more ominous than some other assessments of Tehran’s nuclear capability, the letter says that Iran, before curbing its nuclear program during the long negotiations, was “only a few weeks” away from having fuel for nuclear weapons. Here is a look at what Iran and the United States wanted, and what they got. Dr. Garwin and Dr. Holt were the main organizers behind the group that wrote and signed the letter, according to two of the letter’s signatories. The letter comes amid a flurry of organized efforts by supporters and opponents of the agreement to shape the public debate ahead of congressional action on the deal. The body of the letter praises the technical features of the Iran accord and offers tacit rebuttals to recent criticisms on such issues as verification and provisions for investigating what specialists see as evidence of Iran’s past research on nuclear arms. It also focuses on whether Iran could use the accord as diplomatic cover to pursue nuclear weapons in secret. The deal’s plan for resolving disputes, the letter says, greatly mitigates “concerns about clandestine activities.” It hails the 24-day cap on Iranian delays to site investigations as “unprecedented,” adding that the agreement “will allow effective challenge inspection for the suspected activities of greatest concern.” It also welcomes as without precedent the deal’s explicit banning of research on nuclear weapons “rather than only their manufacture,” as established in the 1968 Non-Proliferation Treaty, the top arms-control agreement of the nuclear age. The letter notes criticism that the Iran accord, after 10 years, will let Tehran potentially develop nuclear arms without constraint. “In contrast,” it says, “we find that the deal includes important long-term verification procedures that last until 2040, and others that last indefinitely.” An on Sunday about a letter of support for President Obama’s proposed Iran nuclear deal written by experts in nuclear weapons and arms control omitted a Nobel laureate from a listing of those who signed the letter. He is Philip W. Anderson of Princeton University. Advertisement
Iran and American Jews	Advertisement Supported by By  Earlier this month, Roland Moskowitz, a Cleveland physician, and Sandra Lippy, a retired health care executive of Boca Raton, Fla., got on the line with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel. As two people who have been active in major Jewish organizations, they were among thousands of American Jews invited to watch whose message was: oppose the Iran nuclear deal. Moskowitz and Lippy listened as Netanyahu claimed the deal would give Iran “hundreds of bombs tomorrow”; turn any terrorist group backed by Iran into a “terrorist superpower”; allow Iran to “have its yellowcake and eat it, too”; cause a nuclear arms race in the Middle East; provide Iran with billions of dollars; and pave Iran’s path to a bomb. The Israeli prime minister was contemptuous of the view, expressed by President Obama, that those who oppose the deal favor war, calling it “not just false, but outrageous.” Netanyahu insisted, against all evidence, that he rejects the deal “because I want to prevent war.” Lippy was not impressed. She thought all the doomsday lines were tired. She’s not about to get on the phone to her representative to press for Congress to condemn the deal and then gather enough votes to override Obama’s inevitable veto of the resolution. That’s what Netanyahu wants to achieve, the deal’s demise, using American Jews as a vehicle. “It’s not a great deal, but it’s enough of a deal to postpone the nuclear situation and maybe give us time to work things out,” Lippy told me. “While they’re being sharply reduced in their nuclear capacity, we can sit down again over the next several years and talk about the Holocaust, Israel and human rights, and that is why I go along with it.” She’s right. A merit of this deal is that it would condemn the United States and Iran to a relationship — hostile, but still a framework for airing differences and doing business — over the next 15 years. Most young Iranians no more believe in “Death to America” than they believe the Hidden Imam is going to show up tomorrow. Moskowitz was left feeling uneasy. On balance, not worrying enough for the United States to walk away. Nor does he want the family strife that would arise if he sided with his fears. His wife, Peta Moskowitz, is a firm supporter of the deal and a member of J Street, the largest Jewish organization to back Obama’s Iran diplomacy. These strains are not unusual. Within families and across the American Jewish community, discussion of the Iran deal is fiery. A few things must be said. Netanyahu’s performance was of a piece with his habit of intervening in American politics, evident at the time of the last presidential election, when his preference for Mitt Romney was clear. His relations with Obama are bad. He tries to circumvent Obama, often in clumsy ways, further undermining the relationship. It’s enough to imagine Obama calling thousands of Israelis to encourage them to oppose a piece of sensitive legislation in the Knesset to gauge how inappropriate Netanyahu’s behavior is. The Netanyahu webcast was co-sponsored by the (an umbrella organization so resistant to the age-old fertile cacophony of Jewish opinion that it rejected J Street’s application for membership last year) and the . Several leading Jewish groups — (Aipac), the American Jewish Committee and the Anti-Defamation League — have come out against the Iran deal. This is unsurprising; they tend to move in lock step with Israel. But it’s troubling because it’s unclear how representative of American Jews as a whole these organizations are. Some polls have suggested a majority of Jews favor the Iran deal; certainly the community is divided. It’s no service to Jews, or Israel or Middle Eastern peace, for major Jewish organizations to be unreflective of this wide diversity of opinion within American Jewry — or for them to give airtime to Netanyahu on Iran rather than Obama. The alternative to this deal, as Obama said, is war. Why? Because sanctions on Iran will fall apart as Russia and China conclude the United States is not serious about a compromise with Tehran that increases the distance between Iran and a bomb, ring-fences its nuclear program, and subjects it to intense international inspection. Centrifuges, slashed in number by America’s diplomacy, will increase again, as will Iran’s uranium stockpile. The war drumbeat will resume. Folly will loom. Rather than listen to Netanyahu, American Jews the longest-serving Jewish member of the House, Sander M. Levin, because it is “the best way to achieve” the goal of preventing Iran from advancing toward a nuclear weapon, so making the Middle East and Israel “far more secure.” They should note that five Jewish senators have come out in favor. In the real world, this is the best achievable deal for America and the ally, Israel, it would never forsake. You can follow me on or join me on . Advertisement
None	Advertisement     The United States, its negotiating partners and Iran reached a framework agreement in April with the aim of finalizing a deal by June 30 that curbs Iran’s nuclear program and leads to the lifting of international sanctions. As diplomats enter yet another overtime period, here is an outline of major developments since the framework agreement that could influence the final round of talks. Speaking in Vienna hours before another self-imposed deadline, said that negotiators were still working on a deal. He said, “We will not rush, and we will not be rushed,” but he also cautioned that the process was not "open ended." Just before Mr. Kerry spoke, Iran's foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, posted a message on Twitter expressing similar sentiments. Diplomats have extended deadlines in Vienna where the talks have been held for the past few weeks. The Obama administration had hoped to present a deal to Congress by July 9 for a 30-day review. If a deal is reached later than that, it cannot be submitted to  Congress before its summer recess, essentially doubling the time critics of a deal would have to organize against it. It remains to be seen if diplomats can agree when sanctions on Iran would be lifted, how long the agreement would last and what sort of inspections will be in place to ensure that Iran does not cheat. Ayatollah , who has the final word on all public matters in Iran, before Tehran has dismantled part of its nuclear infrastructure and before international inspectors verify that the country is beginning to meet its commitments. He also ruled out any freeze on Iran’s sensitive nuclear enrichment for as long as a decade, and he to allow inspections of Iranian military sites. Secretary of State John Kerry indicated the United States was before it fully resolves what, exactly, Iran’s in secret for more than a decade. International inspectors reported that increased about 20 percent over the last 18 months of negotiations, partly undercutting the Obama administration’s contention that the Iranian program had been “frozen” during that period. Secretary of State John Kerry and Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif , the first high-level negotiating round since the two sides on April 2 in Lausanne, Switzerland. The French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, , asserting that it would not sign any pact unless Iran allowed all its nuclear installations, including military sites, to be inspected. France has taken the toughest public stand among the group of powers negotiating with Iran — the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, plus Germany. Wendy R. Sherman, the chief United States negotiator with Iran, said she planned . “It’s been two long years,” she said. With her departure, all of the top officials who have negotiated with Iran over that period will have left the administration, leaving questions about who will coordinate the complex process of carrying out a deal if one is struck by the deadline. Iran began , who has been imprisoned since last July on espionage charges, perhaps as leverage in the nuclear negotiations. Mr. Rezaian is one of at least three Americans currently held in Iran. Political experts, relatives of the prisoners and former prisoners said the Americans might be held as a way of influencing diplomatic negotiations. Saudi Arabia and many  smaller Arab states whatever nuclear enrichment capability Iran is permitted to retain. Leaders of the Sunni Arab states argue that if Iran goes down that road, Washington cannot credibly say that they should not follow, even if their technological abilities are years behind Iran’s. A bill that would give Congress a voice in any nuclear agreement between world powers and Iran overwhelmingly, a rare bipartisan effort to curb presidential power. The bill would require that the Obama administration send the text of a final accord, along with classified material, to Congress as soon as it was completed. Congress would have 30 days to review and vote on any agreement before any sanctions could be lifted. In a letter, five former members of President Obama’s circle of Iran advisers said a pending accord to stem Iran’s nuclear program might “fall short” of administration standards. Advertisement
How Obama Should Sell the Iran Deal	Advertisement Supported by Op-Ed Contributor By  LONDON — IN the long run-up to Tuesday’s nuclear agreement with Iran, the Obama administration repeatedly suggested that the accord was part of a larger strategic shift in Washington’s approach to Iran. Past experience with arms control debates during the Cold War demonstrates that this is a big mistake that could jeopardize hard-won security gains. The administration should now seek to justify the deal exclusively on narrow national security grounds. Although President Obama and his advisers have recently begun to , they have repeatedly, over the past few years, characterized the nuclear talks as part of a more comprehensive administration strategy to establish “a new equilibrium” between Sunnis and Shiites in the Middle East and the Persian Gulf. The unfortunate consequence of these and other exaggerated claims was the alienation of moderate Republicans and friendly Arab leaders, many of whom supported steps to reduce the risk from Iran’s nuclear program but opposed any attempt to improve relations with the Iranian government. As recently as April, when the framework for Tuesday’s deal was announced, Mr. Obama was emphasizing the idea that as the United States reduces its presence in the Middle East, better relations with Iran could help establish a new balance of power there. In an extensive interview with The New York Times’s , Mr. Obama envisioned a nuclear accord and sanctions relief changing Iran’s overall approach, and “then what’s possible is you start seeing an equilibrium in the region, and Sunni and Shia, Saudi and Iran” would begin to consider reducing their tensions. These and similar statements have become fodder, among some observers, for a heroic narrative that Mr. Obama has achieved a rapprochement with Iran comparable to Richard M. Nixon’s breakthrough visit to China in 1972. Indeed, in another interview with Mr. Friedman, on Tuesday, President Nixon’s historic diplomacy with China and promoted the idea that Iran “will be and should be a regional power” — precisely the kind of thinking that drives away potential supporters of a more limited approach. This is unfortunate, because the Iran deal is a solid achievement in terms of nuclear arms control — not a geopolitical watershed. The accord simply offers sanctions relief in exchange for extensive limits on Iran’s ability to enrich uranium, which is the hard part of building a nuclear weapon. By limiting the equipment that can be used for this purpose, it will be far more difficult for Iran to transform its civilian nuclear program into a weapons program. In exchange, and under tight controls, financial sanctions and the ban on oil sales will be lifted, allowing Iran much-needed access to frozen funds and Western investment. The accord’s benefits far outweigh its costs. While the agreement will not prevent a determined Iran from building a nuclear weapon, it will make doing so much harder, and the extensive verification and inspection procedures will make it much easier to discover any such attempt. The easing of sanctions, and the ease with which they can be reimposed, provides a powerful incentive for Iran not to take that risk. In addition to worrying allies abroad, the other problem with linking the nuclear accord to improved American-Iranian relations is the fact that ties may not get better, especially if Iran’s regional policies — like providing life support to Bashar al-Assad’s government in Syria and supporting terrorist organizations — become more aggressive. No one knows if the nuclear agreement will be followed by a more moderate Iranian approach to Syria, Iraq and Lebanon. I suspect it won’t be, because the Revolutionary Guards remain at the core of the Supreme Leader’s coalition and they, not the moderate foreign minister, are the crucial advocates of an aggressive stance in the region. It’s far better to explain how the accord advances American national interests, whether or not Iran changes its regional policies. The best analogy for the deal with Iran is the arms control agreements of the Cold War. The Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) limited Soviet modernization of intercontinental ballistic missiles, and granted the United States an unprecedented degree of access to a closed society. SALT I and SALT II drew strong opposition in Congress when the agreements were seen as part of a broader improvement in American-Soviet relations. In fact, SALT II was never ratified, partly because the Senate debate was hijacked by other foreign policy problems, including the Soviet Union’s invasion of Afghanistan and its deployment of troops in Angola and Cuba. The fact that American military and intelligence agencies supported SALT II was forgotten in the larger political firestorm. Only because President Ronald Reagan decided to continue American compliance with the treaty’s main numerical limits was the steady increase in Moscow’s overall number of missiles and launchers halted. Like the earlier agreements with the Soviet Union, the deal reached with Iran on Tuesday substantially reduces the potential nuclear threat from an adversary and provides access to a relatively closed society. But Iran’s program will not be completely abolished, as many wished. To maximize congressional and international support, Mr. Obama must now focus on the national security benefits of this accord and avoid any new suggestions that the deal was intended as part of a grand strategy for the region. American-Iranian relations may one day improve when Tehran’s destabilizing policies in the region change. The White House can hope that will happen but should not expect it. Whether it occurs is irrelevant to the wisdom of Tuesday’s arms control agreement. James P. Rubin was the assistant secretary of state for public affairs from 1997 to 2000, under President Bill Clinton. Opinion Opinion Opinion Advertisement
Obama Yields, Allowing Congress Say on Iran Nuclear Deal	Advertisement Supported by By  and WASHINGTON — The White House relented on Tuesday and said President Obama would sign a compromise bill giving Congress a voice on the proposed nuclear accord with Iran as the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, in rare unanimous agreement, moved the legislation to the full Senate for a vote. An unusual alliance of Republican opponents of the nuclear deal and some of Mr. Obama’s strongest Democratic supporters demanded a congressional role as international negotiators work to turn this month’s nuclear framework into a final deal by June 30. White House officials insisted they extracted crucial last-minute concessions. Republicans — and many Democrats — said the president simply got overrun. “We’re involved here. We have to be involved here,” said Senator Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland, the committee’s ranking Democrat, who served as a bridge between the White House and Republicans as they negotiated changes in the days before the committee’s vote on Tuesday. “Only Congress can change or permanently modify the sanctions regime.” The essence of the legislation is that Congress will have a chance to vote on whatever deal emerges with Iran — if one is reached by June 30 — but in a way that would be extremely difficult for Mr. Obama to lose, allowing Secretary of State John Kerry to tell his Iranian counterpart that the risk that an agreement would be upended on Capitol Hill is limited. As Congress considers any accord on a very short timetable, it would essentially be able to vote on an eventual end to sanctions, and then later take up the issue depending on whether Iran has met its own obligations. But if it rejected the agreement, Mr. Obama could veto that legislation — and it would take only 34 senators to sustain the veto, meaning that Mr. Obama could lose upward of a dozen Democratic senators and still prevail. The bill would require that the administration send the text of a final accord, along with classified material, to Congress as soon as it is completed. It also halts any lifting of sanctions pending a 30-day congressional review, and culminates in a possible vote to allow or forbid the lifting of congressionally imposed sanctions in exchange for the dismantling of much of Iran’s nuclear infrastructure. It passed 19 to 0. Why Mr. Obama gave in after fierce opposition was the last real dispute of what became a rout. Josh Earnest, the White House spokesman, said Mr. Obama was not “particularly thrilled” with the bill, but had decided that a new proposal put together by the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee made enough changes to make it acceptable. “We’ve gone from a piece of legislation that the president would veto to a piece of legislation that’s undergone substantial revision such that it’s now in the form of a compromise that the president would be willing to sign,” Mr. Earnest said. “That would certainly be an improvement.” Senator , Republican of Tennessee and the committee’s chairman, had a far different interpretation. As late as 11:30 a.m., in a classified briefing at the Capitol, Mr. Kerry was urging senators to oppose the bill. The “change occurred when they saw how many senators were going to vote for this, and only when that occurred,” Mr. Corker said. Mr. Cardin said that the “fundamental provisions” of the legislation had not changed. But the compromise between him and Mr. Corker did shorten a review period of a final Iran nuclear deal and soften language that would make the lifting of sanctions dependent on Iran’s ending support for terrorism. The agreement almost certainly means Congress will muscle its way into nuclear negotiations that Mr. Obama sees as a legacy-defining foreign policy achievement. The Senate is expected to vote on the legislation this month, and House Republican leaders have promised to pass it shortly after. “Congress absolutely should have the opportunity to review this deal,” the House speaker, John A. Boehner of Ohio, said Tuesday. “We shouldn’t just count on the administration, who appears to want a deal at any cost.” White House officials blitzed Congress in the days after the was announced, making 130 phone calls to lawmakers, but quickly came to the conclusion that the legislation could not be blocked altogether. Moreover, officials increasingly worried that an unresolved fight could torpedo the next phase of negotiations with Iran. “Having this lingering uncertainty about whether we could deliver on our side of the deal was probably a deal killer,” said a senior administration official, who asked for anonymity to describe internal deliberations. Under the compromise legislation, a 60-day review period of a final nuclear agreement in the original bill was in effect cut in half, to 30 days, starting with its submission to Congress. But tacked on to that review period potentially would be the maximum 12 days the president would have to decide whether to accept or veto a resolution of disapproval, should Congress take that vote. The formal review period would also include a maximum of 10 days Congress would have to override the veto. For Republicans, that would mean the president could not lift sanctions for a maximum of 52 days after submitting a final accord to Congress, along with all classified material. American and Iranian officials are using different words to describe elements of the preliminary agreement to limit Iran’s nuclear program. And if a final accord is not submitted to Congress by July 9, the review period will snap back to 60 days. That would prevent the administration from intentionally delaying the submission of the accord to the Capitol. Congress could not reopen the mechanics of a deal, and taking no action would be the equivalent of allowing it to move forward. Mr. Corker also agreed to a significant change on the terrorism language. Initially, the bill said the president had to certify every 90 days that Iran no longer was supporting terrorism against Americans. If he could not, economic sanctions would be reimposed. Under the agreement, the president would still have to send periodic reports to Congress on Iran’s activities regarding ballistic missiles and terrorism, but those reports could not trigger another round of sanctions. The measure still faces hurdles. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, fresh off the opening of his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, dropped plans to push for an amendment to make any Iran deal dependent on the Islamic Republic’s recognition of the State of Israel, a diplomatic nonstarter. But he hinted that he could try on the Senate floor. “Not getting anything done plays right into the hands of the administration,” Mr. Rubio said. Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, abandoned an amendment to make any Iran accord into a formal international treaty needing two-thirds of the Senate for its ratification, but he, too, said it could be revived before the full Senate. Mr. Earnest said the president also wanted no more changes. “We’re asking for a commitment that people will pursue the process that’s contemplated in this bill,” he said. Democrats had implored Mr. Obama to embrace the legislation. “If the administration can’t persuade 34 senators of whatever party that this agreement is worth proceeding with, then it’s really a bad agreement,” Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, a Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, said. “That’s the threshold.” To temper opposition to the deal, Mr. Kerry, Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew and Energy Secretary Ernest J. Moniz gathered with senators Tuesday morning in a classified briefing, after a similar briefing on Monday for the House. But the administration met firm opposition in both parties. The agreement “puts Iran, the world’s worst state sponsor of terrorism, on the path to a nuclear weapon,” said Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, as he emerged from the briefing. “Whether that’s a matter of months or a matter of years, that’s a dangerous outcome not just to United States and allies like Israel but to the entire world.” An earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of the Secretary of Energy. He is Ernest Moniz, not Earnest. David E. Sanger and Emmarie Huetteman contributed reporting. video Advertisement
Iran and the Obama Doctrine	Advertisement Supported by By  In September 1996, I visited Iran. One of my most enduring memories of that trip was that in my hotel lobby there was a sign above the door But it wasn’t a banner or graffiti. I thought to myself: “Wow — that’s tiled in there! That won’t come out easily.” Nearly 20 years later, in the wake of a draft deal between the Obama administration and Iran, we have what may be the best chance to begin to pry that sign loose, to ease the U.S.-Iran cold/hot war that has roiled the region for 36 years. But it is a chance fraught with real risks to America, Israel and our Sunni Arab allies: that Iran could eventually become a nuclear-armed state. President Obama invited me to the Oval Office Saturday afternoon to lay out exactly how he was trying to balance these risks and opportunities in the framework accord reached with Iran last week in Switzerland. What struck me most was what I’d call an “Obama doctrine” embedded in the president’s remarks. It emerged when I asked if there was a common denominator to his decisions to break free from longstanding United States policies isolating Burma, Cuba and now Iran. Obama said his view was that “engagement,” combined with meeting core strategic needs, could serve American interests vis-à-vis these three countries far better than endless sanctions and isolation. He added that America, with its overwhelming power, needs to have the self-confidence to take some calculated risks to open important new possibilities — like trying to forge a diplomatic deal with Iran that, while permitting it to keep some of its nuclear infrastructure, forestalls its ability to build a nuclear bomb for at least a decade, if not longer. “We are powerful enough to be able to test these propositions without putting ourselves at risk. And that’s the thing ... people don’t seem to understand,” the president said. “You take a country like Cuba. For us to test the possibility that engagement leads to a better outcome for the Cuban people, there aren’t that many risks for us. It’s a tiny little country. It’s not one that threatens our core security interests, and so [there’s no reason not] to test the proposition. And if it turns out that it doesn’t lead to better outcomes, we can adjust our policies. The same is true with respect to Iran, a larger country, a dangerous country, one that has engaged in activities that resulted in the death of U.S. citizens, but the truth of the matter is: Iran’s defense budget is $30 billion. Our defense budget is closer to $600 billion. Iran understands that they cannot fight us. ... You asked about an Obama doctrine. The doctrine is: We will engage, but we preserve all our capabilities.” The notion that Iran is undeterrable — “it’s simply not the case,” he added. “And so for us to say, ‘Let’s try’ — understanding that we’re preserving all our options, that we’re not naïve — but if in fact we can resolve these issues diplomatically, we are more likely to be safe, more likely to be secure, in a better position to protect our allies, and who knows? Iran may change. If it doesn’t, our deterrence capabilities, our military superiority stays in place. ... We’re not relinquishing our capacity to defend ourselves or our allies. In that situation, why wouldn’t we test it?” Obviously, Israel is in a different situation, he added. “Now, what you might hear from Prime Minister [Benjamin] Netanyahu, which I respect, is the notion, ‘Look, Israel is more vulnerable. We don’t have the luxury of testing these propositions the way you do,’ and I completely understand that. And further, I completely understand Israel’s belief that given the tragic history of the Jewish people, they can’t be dependent solely on us for their own security. But what I would say to them is that not only am I absolutely committed to making sure that they maintain their qualitative military edge, and that they can deter any potential future attacks, but what I’m willing to do is to make the kinds of commitments that would give everybody in the neighborhood, including Iran, a clarity that if Israel were to be attacked by any state, that we would stand by them. And that, I think, should be ... sufficient to take advantage of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see whether or not we can at least take the nuclear issue off the table.” He added: “What I would say to the Israeli people is ... that there is no formula, there is no option, to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon that will be more effective than the diplomatic initiative and framework that we put forward — and that’s demonstrable.” The president gave voice, though — in a more emotional and personal way than I’ve ever heard — to his distress at being depicted in Israel and among American Jews as somehow anti-Israel, when his views on peace are shared by many center-left Israelis and his administration has been acknowledged by Israeli officials to have been as vigorous as any in maintaining Israel’s strategic edge. With huge amounts of conservative campaign money now flowing to candidates espousing pro-Israel views, which party is more supportive of Israel is becoming a wedge issue, an arms race, with Republican candidates competing over who can be the most unreservedly supportive of Israel in any disagreement with the United States, and ordinary, pro-Israel Democrats increasingly feeling sidelined. “This is an area that I’ve been concerned about,” the president said. “Look, Israel is a robust, rowdy democracy. ... We share so much. We share blood, family. ... And part of what has always made the U.S.-Israeli relationship so special is that it has transcended party, and I think that has to be preserved. There has to be the ability for me to disagree with a policy on settlements, for example, without being viewed as ... opposing Israel. There has to be a way for Prime Minister Netanyahu to disagree with me on policy without being viewed as anti-Democrat, and I think the right way to do it is to recognize that as many commonalities as we have, there are going to be strategic differences. And I think that it is important for each side to respect the debate that takes place in the other country and not try to work just with one side. ... But this has been as hard as anything I do because of the deep affinities that I feel for the Israeli people and for the Jewish people. It’s been a hard period.” You take it personally? I asked. “It has been personally difficult for me to hear ... expressions that somehow ... this administration has not done everything it could to look out for Israel’s interest — and the suggestion that when we have very serious policy differences, that that’s not in the context of a deep and abiding friendship and concern and understanding of the threats that the Jewish people have faced historically and continue to face.” As for protecting our Sunni Arab allies, like Saudi Arabia, the president said, they have some very real external threats, but they also have some internal threats — “populations that, in some cases, are alienated, youth that are underemployed, an ideology that is destructive and nihilistic, and in some cases, just a belief that there are no legitimate political outlets for grievances. And so part of our job is to work with these states and say, ‘How can we build your defense capabilities against external threats, but also, how can we strengthen the body politic in these countries, so that Sunni youth feel that they’ve got something other than [the Islamic State, or ISIS] to choose from. ... I think the biggest threats that they face may not be coming from Iran invading. It’s going to be from dissatisfaction inside their own countries. ... That’s a tough conversation to have, but it’s one that we have to have.” That said, the Iran deal is far from finished. As the president cautioned: “We’re not done yet. There are a lot of details to be worked out, and you could see backtracking and slippage and real political difficulties, both in Iran and obviously here in the United States Congress.” On Congress’s role, Obama said he insists on preserving the presidential prerogative to enter into binding agreements with foreign powers without congressional approval. However, he added, “I do think that [Tennessee Republican] Senator Corker, the head of the Foreign Relations Committee, is somebody who is sincerely concerned about this issue and is a good and decent man, and my hope is that we can find something that allows Congress to express itself but does not encroach on traditional presidential prerogatives — and ensures that, if in fact we get a good deal, that we can go ahead and implement it.” Since President Obama has had more direct and indirect dealings with Iran’s leadership — including an exchange of numerous letters with Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei — than any of his predecessors since Iran’s revolution in 1979, I asked what he has learned from the back and forth. “I think that it’s important to recognize that Iran is a complicated country — just like we’re a complicated country,” the president said. “There is no doubt that, given the history between our two countries, that there is deep mistrust that is not going to fade away immediately. The activities that they engage in, the rhetoric, both anti-American, anti-Semitic, anti-Israel, is deeply disturbing. There are deep trends in the country that are contrary to not only our own national security interests and views but those of our allies and friends in the region, and those divisions are real.” But, he added, “what we’ve also seen is that there is a practical streak to the Iranian regime. I think they are concerned about self-preservation. I think they are responsive, to some degree, to their publics. I think the election of [President Hassan] Rouhani indicated that there was an appetite among the Iranian people for a rejoining with the international community, an emphasis on the economics and the desire to link up with a global economy. And so what we’ve seen over the last several years, I think, is the opportunity for those forces within Iran that want to break out of the rigid framework that they have been in for a long time to move in a different direction. It’s not a radical break, but it’s one that I think offers us the chance for a different type of relationship, and this nuclear deal, I think, is a potential expression of that.” What about Iran’s supreme leader, who will be the ultimate decider there on whether or not Iran moves ahead? What have you learned about him? “He’s a pretty tough read,” the president said. “I haven’t spoken to him directly. In the letters that he sends, there [are] typically a lot of reminders of what he perceives as past grievances against Iran, but what is, I think, telling is that he did give his negotiators in this deal the leeway, the capability to make important concessions, that would allow this framework agreement to come to fruition. So what that tells me is that — although he is deeply suspicious of the West [and] very insular in how he thinks about international issues as well as domestic issues, and deeply conservative — he does realize that the sanctions regime that we put together was weakening Iran over the long term, and that if in fact he wanted to see Iran re-enter the community of nations, then there were going to have to be changes.” Since he has acknowledged Israel’s concerns, and the fact that they are widely shared there, if the president had a chance to make his case for this framework deal directly to the Israeli people, what would he say? “Well, what I’d say to them is this,” the president answered. “You have every right to be concerned about Iran. This is a regime that at the highest levels has expressed the desire to destroy Israel, that has denied the Holocaust, that has expressed venomous anti-Semitic ideas and is a big country with a big population and has a sophisticated military. So Israel is right to be concerned about Iran, and they should be absolutely concerned that Iran doesn’t get a nuclear weapon.” But, he insisted, this framework initiative, if it can be implemented, can satisfy that Israeli strategic concern with more effectiveness and at less cost to Israel than any other approach. “We know that a military strike or a series of military strikes can set back Iran’s nuclear program for a period of time — but almost certainly will prompt Iran to rush towards a bomb, will provide an excuse for hard-liners inside of Iran to say, ‘This is what happens when you don’t have a nuclear weapon: America attacks.’ “We know that if we do nothing, other than just maintain sanctions, that they will continue with the building of their nuclear infrastructure and we’ll have less insight into what exactly is happening,” Obama added. “So this may not be optimal. In a perfect world, Iran would say, ‘We won’t have any nuclear infrastructure at all,’ but what we know is that this has become a matter of pride and nationalism for Iran. Even those who we consider moderates and reformers are supportive of some nuclear program inside of Iran, and given that they will not capitulate completely, given that they can’t meet the threshold that Prime Minister Netanyahu sets forth, there are no Iranian leaders who will do that. And given the fact that this is a country that withstood an eight-year war and a million people dead, they’ve shown themselves willing, I think, to endure hardship when they considered a point of national pride or, in some cases, national survival.” The president continued: “For us to examine those options and say to ourselves, ‘You know what, if we can have vigorous inspections, unprecedented, and we know at every point along their nuclear chain exactly what they’re doing and that lasts for 20 years, and for the first 10 years their program is not just frozen but effectively rolled back to a larger degree, and we know that even if they wanted to cheat we would have at least a year, which is about three times longer than we’d have right now, and we would have insights into their programs that we’ve never had before,’ in that circumstance, the notion that we wouldn’t take that deal right now and that that would not be in Israel’s interest is simply incorrect.” Because, Obama argued, “the one thing that changes the equation is when these countries get a nuclear weapon. ... Witness North Korea, which is a problem state that is rendered a lot more dangerous because of their nuclear program. If we can prevent that from happening anyplace else in the world, that’s something where it’s worth taking some risks.” “I have to respect the fears that the Israeli people have,” he added, “and I understand that Prime Minister Netanyahu is expressing the deep-rooted concerns that a lot of the Israeli population feel about this, but what I can say to them is: Number one, this is our best bet by far to make sure Iran doesn’t get a nuclear weapon, and number two, what we will be doing even as we enter into this deal is sending a very clear message to the Iranians and to the entire region that if anybody messes with Israel, America will be there. And I think the combination of a diplomatic path that puts the nuclear issue to one side — while at the same time sending a clear message to the Iranians that you have to change your behavior more broadly and that we are going to protect our allies if you continue to engage in destabilizing aggressive activity — I think that’s a combination that potentially at least not only assures our friends, but starts bringing down the temperature.” There is clearly a debate going on inside Iran as to whether the country should go ahead with this framework deal as well, so what would the president say to the Iranian people to persuade them that this deal is in their interest? If their leaders really are telling the truth that Iran is not seeking a nuclear weapon, the president said, then “the notion that they would want to expend so much on a symbolic program as opposed to harnessing the incredible talents and ingenuity and entrepreneurship of the Iranian people, and be part of the world economy and see their nation excel in those terms, that should be a pretty straightforward choice for them. Iran doesn’t need nuclear weapons to be a powerhouse in the region. For that matter, what I’d say to the Iranian people is: You don’t need to be anti-Semitic or anti-Israel or anti-Sunni to be a powerhouse in the region. I mean, the truth is, Iran has all these potential assets going for it where, if it was a responsible international player, if it did not engage in aggressive rhetoric against its neighbors, if it didn’t express anti-Israeli and anti-Jewish sentiment, if it maintained a military that was sufficient to protect itself, but was not engaging in a whole bunch of proxy wars around the region, by virtue of its size, its resources and its people it would be an extremely successful regional power. And so my hope is that the Iranian people begin to recognize that.” Clearly, he added, “part of the psychology of Iran is rooted in past experiences, the sense that their country was undermined, that the United States or the West meddled in first their democracy and then in supporting the Shah and then in supporting Iraq and Saddam during that extremely brutal war. So part of what I’ve told my team is we have to distinguish between the ideologically driven, offensive Iran and the defensive Iran that feels vulnerable and sometimes may be reacting because they perceive that as the only way that they can avoid repeats of the past. ... But if we’re able to get this done, then what may happen — and I’m not counting on it — but what may happen is that those forces inside of Iran that say, ‘We don’t need to view ourselves entirely through the lens of our war machine. Let’s excel in science and technology and job creation and developing our people,’ that those folks get stronger. ... I say that emphasizing that the nuclear deal that we’ve put together is not based on the idea that somehow the regime changes. “It is a good deal even if Iran doesn’t change at all,” Obama argued. “Even for somebody who believes, as I suspect Prime Minister Netanyahu believes, that there is no difference between Rouhani and the supreme leader and they’re all adamantly anti-West and anti-Israel and perennial liars and cheaters — even if you believed all that, this still would be the right thing to do. It would still be the best option for us to protect ourselves. In fact, you could argue that if they are implacably opposed to us, all the more reason for us to want to have a deal in which we know what they’re doing and that, for a long period of time, we can prevent them from having a nuclear weapon.” There are several very sensitive points in the framework agreement that are not clear to me, and I asked the president for his interpretation. For instance, if we suspect that Iran is cheating, is harboring a covert nuclear program outside of the declared nuclear facilities covered in this deal — say, at a military base in southeastern Iran — do we have the right to insist on that facility being examined by international inspectors? “In the first instance, what we have agreed to is that we will be able to inspect and verify what’s happening along the entire nuclear chain from the uranium mines all the way through to the final facilities like Natanz,” the president said. “What that means is that we’re not just going to have a bunch of folks posted at two or three or five sites. We are going to be able to see what they’re doing across the board, and in fact, if they now wanted to initiate a covert program that was designed to produce a nuclear weapon, they’d have to create a whole different supply chain. That’s point number one. Point number two, we’re actually going to be setting up a procurement committee that examines what they’re importing, what they’re bringing in that they might claim as dual-use, to determine whether or not what they’re using is something that would be appropriate for a peaceful nuclear program versus a weapons program. And number three, what we’re going to be doing is setting up a mechanism whereby, yes, I.A.E.A. [International Atomic Energy Agency] inspectors can go anyplace.” Anywhere in Iran? I asked. “That we suspect,” the president answered. “Obviously, a request will have to be made. Iran could object, but what we have done is to try to design a mechanism whereby once those objections are heard, that it is not a final veto that Iran has, but in fact some sort of international mechanism will be in place that makes a fair assessment as to whether there should be an inspection, and if they determine it should be, that’s the tiebreaker, not Iran saying, ‘No, you can’t come here.’ So over all, what we’re seeing is not just the additional protocols that I.A.E.A. has imposed on countries that are suspected of in the past having had problematic nuclear programs, we’re going even beyond that, and Iran will be subject to the kinds of inspections and verification mechanisms that have never been put in place before.” A lot of people, myself included, will want to see the fine print on that. Another issue that doesn’t seem to have been resolved yet is: When exactly do the economic sanctions on Iran get lifted? When the implementation begins? When Iran has been deemed to be complying fully? “There are still details to be worked out,” the president said, “but I think that the basic framework calls for Iran to take the steps that it needs to around [the Fordow enrichment facility], the centrifuges, and so forth. At that point, then, the U.N. sanctions are suspended; although the sanctions related to proliferation, the sanctions related to ballistic missiles, there’s a set of sanctions that remain in place. At that point, then, we preserve the ability to snap back those sanctions, if there is a violation. If not, though, Iran, outside of the proliferation and ballistic missile issues that stay in place, they’re able to get out from under the sanctions, understanding that this constant monitoring will potentially trigger some sort of action if they’re in violation.” There are still United States sanctions that are related to Iran’s behavior in terrorism and human rights abuse, though, the president added: “There are certain sanctions that we have that would remain in place because they’re not related to Iran’s nuclear program, and this, I think, gets to a central point that we’ve made consistently. If in fact we are able to finalize the nuclear deal, and if Iran abides by it, that’s a big piece of business that we’ve gotten done, but it does not end our problems with Iran, and we are still going to be aggressively working with our allies and friends to reduce — and hopefully at some point stop — the destabilizing activities that Iran has engaged in, the sponsorship of terrorist organizations. And that may take some time. But it’s our belief, it’s my belief, that we will be in a stronger position to do so if the nuclear issue has been put in a box. And if we can do that, it’s possible that Iran, seeing the benefits of sanctions relief, starts focusing more on the economy and its people. And investment starts coming in, and the country starts opening up. If we’ve done a good job in bolstering the sense of security and defense cooperation between us and the Sunni states, if we have made even more certain that the Israeli people are absolutely protected not just by their own capacities, but also by our commitments, then what’s possible is you start seeing an equilibrium in the region, and Sunni and Shia, Saudi and Iran start saying, ‘Maybe we should lower tensions and focus on the extremists like [ISIS] that would burn down this entire region if they could.’ ” Regarding America’s Sunni Arab allies, Obama reiterated that while he is prepared to help increase their military capabilities they also need to increase their willingness to commit their ground troops to solving regional problems. “The conversations I want to have with the Gulf countries is, first and foremost, how do they build more effective defense capabilities,” the president said. “I think when you look at what happens in Syria, for example, there’s been a great desire for the United States to get in there and do something. But the question is: Why is it that we can’t have Arabs fighting [against] the terrible human rights abuses that have been perpetrated, or fighting against what Assad has done? I also think that I can send a message to them about the U.S.’s commitments to work with them and ensure that they are not invaded from the outside, and that perhaps will ease some of their concerns and allow them to have a more fruitful conversation with the Iranians. What I can’t do, though, is commit to dealing with some of these internal issues that they have without them making some changes that are more responsive to their people.” One way to think about it, Obama continued, “is [that] when it comes to external aggression, I think we’re going to be there for our [Arab] friends — and I want to see how we can formalize that a little bit more than we currently have, and also help build their capacity so that they feel more confident about their ability to protect themselves from external aggression.” But, he repeated, “The biggest threats that they face may not be coming from Iran invading. It’s going to be from dissatisfaction inside their own countries. Now disentangling that from real terrorist activity inside their country, how we sort that out, how we engage in the counterterrorism cooperation that’s been so important to our own security — without automatically legitimizing or validating whatever repressive tactics they may employ — I think that’s a tough conversation to have, but it’s one that we have to have.” It feels lately like some traditional boundaries between the executive and legislative branches, when it comes to the conduct of American foreign policy, have been breached. For instance, there was the letter from 47 Republican senators to Iran’s supreme leader cautioning him on striking any deal with Obama not endorsed by them — coming in the wake of Prime Minister Netanyahu being invited by the speaker of the House, John Boehner, to address a joint session of Congress — without consulting the White House. How is Obama taking this? “I do worry that some traditional boundaries in how we think about foreign policy have been crossed,” the president said. “I felt the letter that was sent to the supreme leader was inappropriate. I think that you will recall there were some deep disagreements with President Bush about the Iraq war, but the notion that you would have had a whole bunch of Democrats sending letters to leaders in the region or to European leaders ... trying to undermine the president’s policies I think is troubling. “The bottom line,” he added, “is that we’re going to have serious debates, serious disagreements, and I welcome those because that’s how our democracy is supposed to work, and in today’s international environment, whatever arguments we have here, other people are hearing and reading about it. It’s not a secret that the Republicans may feel more affinity with Prime Minister Netanyahu’s views of the Iran issue than they do with mine. But [we need to be] keeping that within some formal boundaries, so that the executive branch, when it goes overseas, when it’s communicating with foreign leaders, is understood to be speaking on behalf of the United States of America, not a divided United States of America, making sure that whether that president is a Democrat or a Republican that once the debates have been had here, that he or she is the spokesperson on behalf of U.S. foreign policy. And that’s clear to every leader around the world. That’s important because without that, what you start getting is multiple foreign policies, confusion among foreign powers as to who speaks for who, and that ends up being a very dangerous — circumstances that could be exploited by our enemies and could deeply disturb our friends.” As for the Obama doctrine — “we will engage, but we preserve all our capabilities” — the president concluded: “I’ve been very clear that Iran will not get a nuclear weapon on my watch, and I think they should understand that we mean it. But I say that hoping that we can conclude this diplomatic arrangement — and that it ushers a new era in U.S.-Iranian relations — and, just as importantly, over time, a new era in Iranian relations with its neighbors.” Whatever happened in the past, he said, “at this point, the U.S.’s core interests in the region are not oil, are not territorial. ... Our core interests are that everybody is living in peace, that it is orderly, that our allies are not being attacked, that children are not having barrel bombs dropped on them, that massive displacements aren’t taking place. Our interests in this sense are really just making sure that the region is working. And if it’s working well, then we’ll do fine. And that’s going to be a big project, given what’s taken place, but I think this [Iran framework deal] is at least one place to start.” Charles M. Blow’s column will appear on this page tomorrow.

Democrats in Congress Give Obama Breathing Room on Nuclear Talks With Iran 	Advertisement Supported by By  WASHINGTON — In a reprieve for President Obama, Democrats in Congress who support legislation that gives Congress the authority to review his emerging nuclear deal with Iran pledged Wednesday to wait to press their case until after a March 24 negotiating deadline between the two nations. Angered by Republican efforts to speed action on bipartisan legislation that could tie Mr. Obama’s hands in the nuclear talks, the Democrats said they would withhold their votes on the bill until after the date set for reaching a political framework for a negotiated agreement with Iran. The move by Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey and eight other Democrats, as well as Senator Angus King, an independent of Maine, effectively freezes in place efforts to build a bipartisan coalition that would force a congressional review of any Iran deal. For the president, the action merely postpones what is emerging as a steep challenge to one of his most important foreign policy priorities. There is a growing bipartisan coalition of lawmakers in Congress who believe they must have a say over any final agreement — if one is reached — to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, and they are moving aggressively to lay out tough requirements for Mr. Obama that could shape any deal. The White House has said that the president would veto the congressional review legislation, which is co-sponsored by Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, and Mr. Menendez, the panel’s ranking Democrat. Their bill would require the president to submit any agreement to Congress and restrict his authority to waive sanctions for 60 days to give lawmakers time to weigh in. But shortly after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel finished his speech to Congress on Tuesday arguing against Mr. Obama’s proposed deal with Iran, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, moved to expedite a vote on the review bill. His maneuver sets the stage for a procedural vote on Tuesday. The move took Democrats by surprise and triggered a backlash even among the measure’s strongest supporters. Mr. McConnell’s move “poisons the well,” Mr. Menendez said Wednesday. “There’s no reason to rush this to the floor unless you’re looking for a political process.” In a letter to Mr. McConnell, Mr. Menendez and backers of the bill and a handful of other Democrats said the measure should go through the standard process of being considered and then voted on by a committee before being brought to the floor for a vote. Their opposition effectively guarantees defeat for Tuesday’s procedural maneuver, likely pushing off action on the measure until later this month. “On a day defined by serious discourse about Iran’s illicit nuclear weapons program, at a moment when legislators are contemplating the most serious national security issue of our time, we are disappointed that you have proceeded outside of regular order which suggests that the goal of this maneuver is to score partisan political points, rather than pursue a substantive strategy to counter Iran’s nuclear ambitions,” the senators wrote to Mr. McConnell. “As a result of your actions, we will only vote for this bill after it has gone through the regular markup process in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and after the March 24th deadline for the political framework agreement,” they wrote, referring to the date when the United States and six other countries are aiming to reach a tentative deal. The objections delayed but did not remove the obstacles facing Mr. Obama in winning a skeptical Congress’s acceptance of a deal with Iran. While he has broad authority as president to strike and implement such an agreement, Congress could handcuff his ability to do so by depriving him of the authority to lift sanctions imposed through legislation. And with Democratic support growing for congressional input, Mr. Obama is facing the possibility that Republicans could eventually find enough support in his own party to override a veto and insist on oversight. Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said Mr. Obama would veto the legislation regardless of when it came up, because it could undermine the negotiations with Iran, although he said the administration “does believe that Congress has a legitimate role in this process.” What the United States and Iran want out of discussions over Iran’s nuclear development. “What I also understand is that many of the Democrats, including some who do support the legislation, are now changing their mind about the bill because of the partisan tactics that are being employed by the Republican majority in the Senate,” Mr. Earnest said. “So, it may be a situation where the president doesn’t even have to veto it because there are now legitimate questions that are being raised about whether or not it’s actually going to even pass the Senate.” But Democratic aides said that however angry their side was about Mr. McConnell’s move, they were unlikely to back down. “They were content to defer to the president’s wishes and give him some space and some time, but a lot of people in the caucus believe that Congress should have some say in what happens here, and they were not swayed off of that,” one senior Democratic official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the discussions were private. “Both parties really think that there should be some congressional oversight over this.” Mr. McConnell said it was important for Congress to vote on the measure before the deadline, to make it clear to Iran that Mr. Obama will not be able to implement a deal that “leaves Iran as a threshold nuclear state.” “The Iranians need to know that congressional sanctions will not be lifted if a bad deal is reached,” Mr. McConnell said. “Time is running out.” He added, “There is nothing partisan about the Senate acting to serve its constitutional role in oversight, and in pursuing policies that uphold the national security interest.” Not all Republicans agreed with Mr. McConnell’s plan to speed up the timetable for a vote. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said Wednesday that doing anything before March 24 would disrupt what so far has been a bipartisan effort. “I don’t want to do it now; I want a result,” he said. “I’m very sensitive to the fact that Democrats don’t want to do anything that would be perceived as disrupting the negotiations before the 24th. After the 24th, I believe there will be huge bipartisan support of congressional review of any deal with the Iranians.” Jeremy W. Peters contributed reporting. Advertisement
The Door to Iran Opens	Advertisement Supported by By  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel calls it a “historic mistake” that permits Iran “a sure path to nuclear weapons.” A minister in his government, unable to resist outrageous hyperbole, calls it “one of the darkest days in world history.” Jeb Bush, doing the tired Chamberlain-Obama number, dismisses it as “appeasement.” So what do the critics, from Republican presidential hopefuls to the Israeli government, seek in place of the deal with Iran that verifiably blocks Tehran’s path to a nuclear weapon for at least the next 10 to 15 years? Presumably, they want what would have happened if negotiations had collapsed. That would be renewed war talk as an unconstrained Iran installs sophisticated centrifuges, its stockpile of enriched uranium grows, Russia and China abandon the sanctions regime, moderates in Iran like Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif are sidelined, and a nuclear-armed Islamic Republic draws closer. To favor such peril, when a constructive alternative exists that engages one of the most highly educated societies in the Middle East, amounts to foolishness dressed up as machismo. The Iran nuclear deal is not perfect, nor was it ever intended to address the long list of American-Iranian grievances, which will persist. It must be judged on what it set out to do — stop Iran going nuclear — not on whether Iran has a likeable regime (it does not) or does bad things (it does). President Obama did not set out to change Iran but he has created a framework that, over a decade, might. If implemented, the agreement constitutes the most remarkable American diplomatic achievement since the Dayton Accords put an end to the Bosnian war two decades ago. It increases the distance between Iran and a bomb as it reduces the distance between Iran and the world. It makes the Middle East less dangerous by forestalling proliferation. In a cacophonous age of short-termism, it offers a lesson of stubborn leadership in pursuit of a long-term goal. For many years, before Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry embarked on their diplomacy, Iran had been increasing its operating centrifuges and the size and enrichment level of its uranium stockpile. Now, the number of centrifuges is to be slashed by two-thirds to 5,060; the stockpile is to be all but eliminated; enrichment levels are capped at 3.7 percent, a long way from bomb grade; the potential route to weapons-grade plutonium at Arak is disabled; international inspection is redoubled and, in Obama’s words, will extend “where necessary,” “when necessary.” In return, Iran gets the phased elimination of most sanctions, the end to its pariah status, and a windfall that will alleviate its economic crisis. And this is “one of the darkest days in world history”? No, it is a moment for guarded hope. Iran, at 36 years from its theocratic revolution, is a repressive but pragmatic power under an aging leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, whose conduct in the talks saw his anti-American instincts counterbalanced by understanding of a reform imperative. Iran is finely poised between a tough old guard forged in revolution and its aspirational, Westward-looking youth. A decade is a long time in societies in transition. It is far better to have deep American-Iranian differences — over Hezbollah, over Syria, over regional Shiite irredentism, over Iran’s vile anti-Israel outbursts — addressed through dialogue rather than have Iran do its worst as pariah. This accord has the merit of condemning the United States and Tehran to a relationship — however hostile — over the next 15 years. The Middle East, several of its states irremediably fractured, needs a new security framework. This will take years. But to imagine it could ever be fashioned without Iran’s involvement is fantasy. Meanwhile, the West and Iran have a common enemy: the medieval slaughterers of Islamic State. Whether concerted action will result from a shared objective is unclear, but the possibility is there. Many possibilities have been opened by this accord. They include the doomsayers’ vision of a dissembling, newly solvent Iran at work to subversive, anti-American ends. Strict verification is imperative. But Congress should think twice before the feel-good, reckless adoption of a resolution condemning a deal that advances American interests. Obama would veto it, and almost certainly has the votes to resist an override, but this would be a regrettable way for the nation to assume such a ground-shifting agreement. The president is right to invoke the bold accords of past presidents — both Republicans — with hostile regimes in Beijing and Moscow. Neither was risk-free. Both proved transformative — not only of bilateral relations but the entire world. Israel, too, should ask the hard questions rather than dismiss a deal that puts Iran much further from a bomb, empowers Iranian reformists, locks in American-Iranian dialogue and will be leveraged by Netanyahu to secure more advanced American weapons systems. The darkest days in history for the Jewish people were of an altogether different order. They should never be trivialized. You can follow me on or join me on . Gail Collins is on book leave.

Iran Agrees to Detailed Nuclear Outline, First Step Toward a Wider Deal	Advertisement Supported by By  and LAUSANNE, Switzerland — Iran and the United States, along with five other world powers, announced on Thursday a surprisingly specific and comprehensive understanding on limiting Tehran’s nuclear program for the next 15 years, though they left several specific issues to a final agreement in June. After two years of negotiations, capped by eight tumultuous days and nights of talks that appeared on the brink of breakdown several times, Secretary of State John Kerry and his Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif, announced the plan, which, if carried out, would keep Iran’s nuclear facilities open under strict production limits, and which holds the potential of reordering America’s relationship with a country that has been an avowed adversary for 35 years. Mr. Kerry and Energy Secretary Ernest J. Moniz, a nuclear scientist who played a crucial role in the last stages of the negotiations, said the pact satisfied their primary goal of ensuring that Iran, if it decided to, could not race for a nuclear weapon in less than a year, although those constraints against “breakout” would be in effect only for the first decade of the accord. President Obama, for whom remaking the American relationship with Iran has been a central objective since his 2008 campaign, stepped into the Rose Garden moments later to celebrate what he called “a historic understanding with Iran.” He warned Republicans in Congress that if they tried to impose new sanctions to undermine the effort, the United States would be blamed for a diplomatic failure. He insisted that the deal “cuts off every pathway” for Iran to develop a nuclear weapon and establishes the most intrusive inspection system in history. “If Iran cheats,” he said, “the world will know it.” Under the accord, Iran agreed to cut the number of operating centrifuges it has by two-thirds, to 5,060, all of them first-generation, and to cut its current stockpile of low-enriched uranium from around 10,000 kilograms to 300 for 15 years. An American description of the deal also referred to inspections “anywhere in the country” that could “investigate suspicious sites or allegations of a covert enrichment facility.” But in a briefing, American officials talked about setting up a mechanism to resolve disputes that has not been explained in any detail. In a move not seen since before the Iranian revolution in 1979, and to the surprise of many in both countries, Iranian government broadcasters aired Mr. Obama’s comments live. In parts of Tehran, people cheered and honked car horns as they began to contemplate a life without sanctions on oil and financial transactions, though the issue of when the sanctions are to be removed looms as one of the potential obstacles to a final agreement on June 30. If that hurdle and the problem of ridding Iran of its huge nuclear fuel stockpile can be fully resolved in the next three months, the preliminary accord will still need to be sold to Iran’s neighbors. The prospect of a deal has inflamed Israel and the Gulf states, alarmed by Iranian muscle-flexing in the Middle East, most recently in Iraq, Syria and Yemen. There is so much concern that Mr. Obama, in a phone call today to King Salman of Saudi Arabia, invited Arab leaders to Camp David this spring to discuss Iran and the turmoil in the region. Analysts have long been worried that Saudi Arabia and other Arab states might mount their own nuclear programs if they decide that Iran is being allowed to retain too much of its nuclear infrastructure. In a telephone call from Air Force One on Thursday afternoon, Mr. Obama told Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, that while the deal was not final, it “represents significant progress towards a lasting, comprehensive solution that cuts off all of Iran’s pathways to a bomb and verifiably ensures the peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear program going forward,” according to an account of the conversation from the White House. Mr. Netanyahu, a strong critic of the deal, was apparently not mollified, and released a statement saying, “A deal based on this framework would threaten the survival of Israel.” Mr. Zarif, for his part, was careful to play down the notion that anything agreed to here would remake the relationship. Any hint of a broader rapprochement is an enormously sensitive issue among hard-liners in the Iranian military and clerical leaders who have made opposition to the United States the centerpiece of their political narratives. “Iran-U.S. relations have nothing to do with this,” Mr. Zarif said emphatically at a university here, where the agreement was announced. “This was an attempt to resolve the nuclear issue.” While saying he hoped the two countries would find a way to melt away their distrust as the agreement was carried out, he hastened to add, “We have serious differences with the United States.” Now, attention will shift to Mr. Obama and Hassan Rouhani, the Iranian president, who was elected on a platform of ending sanctions. They share a common task: selling the agreement at home to constituencies deeply suspicious of both the deal and the prospect of signing any accord with an avowed enemy. The White House has promised a lobbying campaign by the president unlike any seen since he pushed through health care legislation. Mr. Zarif and other Iranian officials may have an even harder political argument to win. They will have to overcome objections in the military and scientific establishments, especially because the accord will force them to cut the number of centrifuges enriching uranium by half, put thousands of others in storage and convert two other facilities into research sites that would have virtually no fissile material — the makings of an atom bomb. Iran has insisted that its nuclear program is for civilian uses only. Mr. Zarif seemed to sense the scope of the challenge in how he framed the agreement. He focused on the fact that Iran would not have to dismantle any facilities — something Washington had initially demanded, especially after helping expose one such secret facility, called Fordo, in Mr. Obama’s first year in office. When, late on Thursday, the White House began distributing a description of what amounted to Iranian concessions, an obviously angry Mr. Zarif challenged the American accounting in several posts on Twitter. Whether Iran is racing toward nuclear weapon capabilities is one of the most contentious foreign-policy issues challenging the West. “There is no need to spin using ‘fact sheets’ so early on,” , only an hour or so after. that sanctions would have to be lifted far earlier than one might think listening to Mr. Kerry, saying that, in essence, all the economic sanctions would be lifted once a final agreement was signed. That could be another issue for the two sides, in that Washington has insisted that the sanctions be removed in a step-by-step manner as Iran fulfills its obligations under the agreement. At another point, Mr. Zarif cautioned that no one had signed anything in Lausanne, and “nobody has obligations now.” That would come after a final agreement. A guide to help you navigate the deal between global powers and Tehran. Another problem for Mr. Zarif is that the deal he has agreed to is far more restrictive than one he outlined last July . At that time, he envisioned essentially keeping Iran’s stockpiles and its sprawling nuclear facilities at the levels they are running under a temporary agreement struck 18 months ago. What he agreed to in Lausanne, at least according to those fact sheets, would drastically cut Iran’s capability for 10 years and then allow it to build up gradually for the next five. After that, Iran would be free to produce as much uranium as it wishes — even building the 190,000 centrifuges that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei talked about last summer. That is bound to be a major concern for Congress, the Israelis and the Arab states, because it amounts to a bet that after 15 years, Iran will be a far more cooperative international player, perhaps under different management. The 5,060 centrifuges is a far higher figure than the administration originally envisioned, when it argued that Iran could possess only a few hundred. But in the final negotiations, Mr. Moniz and his Iranian counterpart, Ali Akbar Salehi, the M.I.T.-educated head of Iran’s atomic energy agency, agreed that Iran would drastically cut its stockpile of nuclear fuel, from about eight tons to a little over 600 pounds. The giant underground enrichment site at Fordo, which Israeli and some American officials fear is impervious to bombing, would be partly converted to advanced nuclear research and the production of medical isotopes. About two thirds of its centrifuges would be removed. Eventually, foreign scientists would be present. It would have no fissile material that could be used to make a bomb. But perhaps the most important compromise came in a lengthy battle over whether Iran would be allowed to conduct research and development on advanced centrifuges, which are far more efficient than current models. The Iranians won the right to research, but not to use more modern machines for production for the next 10 years. At Arak, which officials feared could produce plutonium, another pathway to a bomb, Iran agreed to redesign a heavy-water reactor in a way that would keep it from producing weapons-usable fuel. Those conditions impressed two of the most skeptical experts on the negotiations: Gary Samore and Olli Heinonen of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard and members of a group called United Against Nuclear Iran. Mr. Samore, who was Mr. Obama’s top adviser on weapons of mass destruction in his first term as president, said in an email that the deal was a “very satisfactory resolution of Fordo and Arak issues for the 15-year term” of the accord. He had more questions about operations at Natanz and said there was “much detail to be negotiated, but I think it’s enough to be called a political framework.” Mr. Heinonen, the former chief inspector of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said, “It appears to be a fairly comprehensive deal with most important parameters.” But he cautioned that “Iran maintains enrichment capacity which will be beyond its near-term needs.” Thomas Erdbrink contributed reporting from Tehran, and Julie Hirschfeld Davis from Washington. video Advertisement
Trump Urges Iran to Talk Over Nuclear Program, Cannot Rule Out Military Action	Advertisement Supported by By  WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday urged Iran's leadership to sit down and talk with him about giving up Tehran's nuclear program and said he could not rule out a military confrontation given the heightened tensions between the two countries. At an impromptu news conference at the White House, Trump declined to say what prompted him to deploy the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier group to the region over what was described as unspecified threats. "We have information that you don't want to know about," said Trump. "They were very threatening and we have to have great security for this country and many other places." Trump was asked whether there was a risk of military confrontation with the American military presence in the area. "I guess you could say that always, right? I don't want to say no, but hopefully that won't happen. We have one of the most powerful ships in the world that is loaded up and we don't want to do anything," he said. Top members of the president's national security team discussed Iran and other topics during what the White House called a routine meeting. Trump, who last year pulled Washington out of a 2015 nuclear deal between six world powers and Iran, has expressed a willingness to meet Iranian leaders in the past to no avail and renewed that appeal in talking to reporters. "What they should be doing is calling me up, sitting down. We can make a deal, a fair deal, we just don't want them to have nuclear weapons - not too much to ask. And we would help put them back to great shape." He added: "They should call. If they do, we're open to talk to them." Asked about Trump's comments, Iran's ambassador to the United Nations Majid Takht Ravanchi said Iran had been talking with the six powers, including the United States, within the framework of the nuclear deal. "All of a sudden he decided to leave the negotiating table. ... What is the guarantee that he will not renege again?" Takht Ravanchi said in an MSNBC interview. He dismissed U.S. allegations of an Iranian threat as "fake intelligence" and said they were "being produced by the same people who in the run-up to the U.S. invasion of Iraq did the same." Trump accused former Secretary of State John Kerry, who helped negotiate the 2015 Iran nuclear deal that Trump withdrew from, of breaking a federal law by having contacts with the Iranians. Last September Kerry told the Hugh Hewitt radio program that he had met with Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif three or four times. Trump said Kerry had violated the 1799 Logan Act, which makes it a crime for individual American citizens to negotiate with foreign governments that have a dispute with the United States. "He's talking to Iran and has many meetings and many phone calls and he's telling them what to do. That is total violation of the Logan Act," said Trump. A Kerry spokesman said Trump was wrong. "He's wrong about the facts, wrong about the law, and sadly he's been wrong about how to use diplomacy to keep America safe," the spokesman said. "We'd hope the president would focus on solving foreign policy problems for America instead of attacking his predecessors for theater."

Head of Group Opposing Iran Accord Quits Post, Saying He Backs Deal 	Advertisement Supported by By  WASHINGTON — When the bipartisan advocacy group United Against Nuclear Iran decided last week to mobilize opposition against the nuclear deal with Tehran, Gary Samore knew he could no longer serve as its president. The reason: After long study, Mr. Samore, a former nuclear adviser to President Obama, had concluded that the accord was in the United States’ interest. “I think President Obama’s strategy succeeded,” said Mr. Samore, who left his post on Monday. “He has created economic leverage and traded it away for Iranian nuclear concessions.” As soon as Mr. Samore left, the group announced a new standard-bearer with a decidedly different message: Joseph I. Lieberman, the former senator from Connecticut and the new chairman of the group. “It’s a bad deal,” said Mr. Lieberman, who believes that lawmakers have a chance to block the accord even if that means overcoming a presidential veto. “If the Iranians are pressured more, I think we can get a better agreement.” To get that message across, the group has announced a multimillion-dollar television and digital media campaign. Yet it is Mr. Samore’s quiet departure as president of the organization that is resonating among the small community of experts who have pored over the agreement. Mr. Samore helped establish the organization in 2008, well before serious nuclear talks were underway. The aim was to strengthen the international economic sanctions against Iran, which Mr. Samore was convinced had been mounting a clandestine effort to develop nuclear weapons. Mr. Samore, who traveled to Iran in 2005, is well known to the Iranians. At a dinner that Mr. Samore attended during a meeting of the United Nations General Assembly in 2013, Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iran’s foreign minister, repeated assurances that Iran’s nuclear efforts were entirely peaceful. “We are all united against a nuclear Iran,” he quipped, as he cast a glance at Mr. Samore. Mr. Samore, who now runs the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard, initially said that the chances of a successful negotiation were dim. But after the framework of an accord in Lausanne, Switzerland, in April, he praised it as a good first step. Mark D. Wallace, the chief executive of the group and a diplomat in the George W. Bush administration, said that the organization’s members had sought to keep an open mind. But after the final terms became clear, “The opposition was nearly unanimous,” he said. With that move, it was clear that Mr. Samore needed to move on. “We had an honest discussion that I wouldn’t be able to continue to serve as president if UANI was going to come out against the agreement, since I support it,” Mr. Samore said. “Nonetheless, I support the work that UANI has done in the past to strengthen sanctions, and I think they will have a role to play in the future to maintain nonnuclear sanctions if the deal goes forward,” he said. (He will continue to serve on the group’s advisory board.) Though he backs the accord as the most that can be achieved diplomatically, Mr. Samore is skeptical that the agreement will open a new chapter in American-Iranian relations. “The best you can achieve with diplomacy is delay in the hope that at some point a new Iranian government emerges that is not committed to developing nuclear weapons,” he said. And if that leadership does not materialize, Mr. Samore acknowledges that Iran might vastly expand its nuclear enrichment program after core elements of the agreement expire in 15 years. He is also not convinced that Iran will continue to adhere to the accord once economic sanctions are lifted. Even so, he argues, the accord will put the United States in a stronger position to respond than a congressional rejection would. “We will have bought a couple of years, and if Iran cheats or reneges we will be in an even better position to double down on sanctions or, if necessary, use military force,” Mr. Samore said. “If I knew for certain that in five years they would cheat or renege, I’d still take the deal.” Advertisement
Democrats Childishly Resist Trump’s North Korea Efforts	Advertisement Supported by By  Opinion Columnist Shock! Horror! President Trump is actually doing something right. Sadly, Democrats in Congress are responding in a quite Trumpian way: They seem more concerned with undermining him than supporting a peace process with North Korea. They are on the same side as National Security Adviser John Bolton, quietly subverting attempts to pursue peace. While international security is complicated, here’s a rule of thumb: When you find yourself on the same side as Bolton, go back and re-examine your position. Sure, we all wish that Trump treated Justin Trudeau or Angela Merkel with the respect that he now shows Kim Jong-un. Yes, it seems that Trump has been played by Kim. Yet another way of putting it is that Trump is finally investing in the kind of diplomatic engagement that he used to denounce, and that we should all applaud. Trump’s newfound pragmatism is infinitely preferable to the threat of nuclear war that used to hang over all of us, so it’s mystifying to see Democrats carping about any possible North Korea deal. “Any deal that explicitly or implicitly gives North Korea sanctions relief for anything other than the verifiable performance of its obligations to dismantle its nuclear and missile arsenal is a bad deal,” seven Democratic senators, including Chuck Schumer, warned in a letter to Trump this week. The letter also insisted on “anywhere, anytime” inspections of suspected North Korean nuclear sites, as well as those linked to its chemical and biological warfare programs. It’s almost unimaginable that North Korea will allow such intrusive inspections — any country would resist having an enemy poke around its military bases, underground bomb shelters and border fortifications. So these Democrats are essentially saying that no plausible deal will pass muster. “The Democrats have gone overboard in the conditions they listed in the letter,” said Joel Wit, a North Korea watcher at the Stimson Center in Washington. “If they’re serious, it’s a prescription for failure because no one could achieve the conditions. It’s maybe payback for everything they were dealt in the Iran deal.” “It’s like role reversal,” Wit added. “For years Democrats criticized Republicans for not wanting to engage North Korea. Now that Republicans want to engage North Korea, the Democrats are preparing to criticize them.” Aside from Schumer, the Democratic senators who signed the letter are Sherrod Brown, Richard Durbin, Dianne Feinstein, Patrick Leahy, Robert Menendez and Mark Warner. I appreciate that it’s galling for Democrats to see Trump present himself as a great strategist who has forced North Korea to knuckle under. White House aide Larry Kudlow boasted on Fox News: “North Korea coming to the negotiating table has a lot do with President Trump’s very firm stand.” Poppycock. North Korean leaders have been eager for decades to meet with an American president; it’s just that no previous president agreed for fear of legitimizing the regime. It’s actually Trump who has made stunning compromises — holding a get-acquainted summit with Kim without any prospect of near-term denuclearization. The real hero here is South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in, who shrewdly used the Olympics to kick-start the peace process. Trump and Kim won’t get a Nobel Peace Prize, but if the peace process survives, Moon will be a worthy recipient. For decades, especially after Bill Clinton’s 1994 “Agreed Framework” with North Korea, it was conservative Republicans who were the spoilers on nuclear deals with North Korea and Iran alike. This G.O.P. petulance was bad for America. Bolton helped kill the Agreed Framework, so that North Korea hugely expanded its weapons program. Similar petulance led Trump and Bolton to try to destroy the Iran nuclear deal this spring; as a result, Iran this week announced that it was increasing its uranium enrichment capacity. Boy, that went well. Now a similar partisan petulance seems to be turning some Democrats into spoilers. Trump’s engagement with North Korea has been chaotic and should have begun with working-level talks, but it’s still better for leaders to exchange handshakes than missiles. Granted, there’s plenty of reason to be nervous about Trump’s deal making with North Korea, and plans can still collapse. How will Trump manage Kim when he can’t even manage a summit with the Philadelphia Eagles? Still, even if North Korea won’t hand over nuclear weapons in the next few years, I can imagine it committing in coming months to a sustained moratorium on nuclear tests and long-range missile tests, on production of plutonium and uranium fuel, on transfer of nuclear technology to other countries, such as Syria. North Korea might also destroy an ICBM or two and accept inspectors at its nuclear sites in Yongbyon. Trump and Kim might agree to exchange liaison offices and to declare peace on the Korean Peninsula. North Korea might well cheat, and these are half-steps, not rapid denuclearization. But half-steps toward peace are better than full strides toward war. Gail Collins is on book leave. Opinion Opinion Opinion Advertisement
Text and Video: Obama’s Address on the Iran Nuclear Deal	Advertisement Supported by Today, after two years of negotiations, the United States, together with our international partners, has achieved something that decades of animosity has not — a comprehensive, long-term deal with Iran that will prevent it from obtaining a nuclear weapon. This deal demonstrates that American diplomacy can bring about real and meaningful change — change that makes our country, and the world, safer and more secure. This deal is also in line with a tradition of American leadership. It’s now more than 50 years since President Kennedy stood before the American people and said, “Let us never negotiate out of fear, but let us never fear to negotiate.” He was speaking then about the need for discussions between the United States and the Soviet Union, which led to efforts to restrict the spread of nuclear weapons. In those days, the risk was a catastrophic nuclear war between two super powers. In our time, the risk is that nuclear weapons will spread to more and more countries, particularly in the Middle East, the most volatile region in our world. Today, because America negotiated from a position of strength and principle, we have stopped the spread of nuclear weapons in this region. Because of this deal, the international community will be able to verify that the Islamic Republic of Iran will not develop a nuclear weapon. This deal meets every single one of the bottom lines that we established when we achieved a framework earlier this spring. Every pathway to a nuclear weapon is cut off. And the inspection and transparency regime necessary to verify that objective will be put in place. Because of this deal, Iran will not produce the highly enriched uranium and weapons-grade plutonium that form the raw materials necessary for a nuclear bomb. Because of this deal, Iran will remove two-thirds of its installed centrifuges — the machines necessary to produce highly enriched uranium for a bomb — and store them under constant international supervision. Iran will not use its advanced centrifuges to produce enriched uranium for the next decade. Iran will also get rid of 98 percent of its stockpile of enriched uranium. To put that in perspective, Iran currently has a stockpile that could produce up to 10 nuclear weapons. Because of this deal, that stockpile will be reduced to a fraction of what would be required for a single weapon. This stockpile limitation will last for 15 years. Because of this deal, Iran will modify the core of its reactor in Arak so that it will not produce weapons-grade plutonium. And it has agreed to ship the spent fuel from the reactor out of the country for the lifetime of the reactor. For at least the next 15 years, Iran will not build any new heavy-water reactors. Because of this deal, we will, for the first time, be in a position to verify all of these commitments. That means this deal is not built on trust; it is built on verification. Inspectors will have 24/7 access to Iran’s key nuclear facilities. Iran [Inspectors] will have access to Iran’s entire nuclear supply chain — its uranium mines and mills, its conversion facility, and its centrifuge manufacturing and storage facilities. This ensures that Iran will not be able to divert materials from known facilities to covert ones. Some of these transparency measures will be in place for 25 years. Because of this deal, inspectors will also be able to access any suspicious location. Put simply, the organization responsible for the inspections, the I.A.E.A., will have access where necessary, when necessary. That arrangement is permanent. And the I.A.E.A. has also reached an agreement with Iran to get access that it needs to complete its investigation into the possible military dimensions of Iran’s past nuclear research. Finally, Iran is permanently prohibited from pursuing a nuclear weapon under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which provided the basis for the international community’s efforts to apply pressure on Iran. As Iran takes steps to implement this deal, it will receive relief from the sanctions that we put in place because of Iran’s nuclear program — both America’s own sanctions and sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council. This relief will be phased in. Iran must complete key nuclear steps before it begins to receive new sanctions relief. And over the course of the next decade, Iran must abide by the deal before additional sanctions are lifted, including five years for restrictions related to arms, and eight years for restrictions related to ballistic missiles. All of this will be memorialized and endorsed in a new United Nations Security Council resolution. And if Iran violates the deal, all of these sanctions will snap back into place. So there’s a very clear incentive for Iran to follow through, and there are very real consequences for a violation. That’s the deal. It has the full backing of the international community. Congress will now have an opportunity to review the details, and my administration stands ready to provide extensive briefings on how this will move forward. As the American people and Congress review the deal, it will be important to consider the alternative. Consider what happens in a world without this deal. Without this deal, there is no scenario where the world joins us in sanctioning Iran until it completely dismantles its nuclear program. Nothing we know about the Iranian government suggests that it would simply capitulate under that kind of pressure. And the world would not support an effort to permanently sanction Iran into submission. We put sanctions in place to get a diplomatic resolution, and that is what we have done. Without this deal, there would be no agreed-upon limitations for the Iranian nuclear program. Iran could produce, operate and test more and more centrifuges. Iran could fuel a reactor capable of producing plutonium for a bomb. And we would not have any of the inspections that allow us to detect a covert nuclear weapons program. In other words, no deal means no lasting constraints on Iran’s nuclear program. Such a scenario would make it more likely that other countries in the region would feel compelled to pursue their own nuclear programs, threatening a nuclear arms race in the most volatile region of the world. It would also present the United States with fewer and less effective options to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. I’ve been president and commander in chief for over six years now. Time and again, I have faced decisions about whether or not to use military force. It’s the gravest decision that any president has to make. Many times, in multiple countries, I have decided to use force. And I will never hesitate to do so when it is in our national security interest. I strongly believe that our national security interest now depends upon preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon — which means that without a diplomatic resolution, either I or a future U.S. president would face a decision about whether or not to allow Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon or whether to use our military to stop it. Put simply, no deal means a greater chance of more war in the Middle East. Moreover, we give nothing up by testing whether or not this problem can be solved peacefully. If, in a worst-case scenario, Iran violates the deal, the same options that are available to me today will be available to any U.S. president in the future. And I have no doubt that 10 or 15 years from now, the person who holds this office will be in a far stronger position with Iran further away from a weapon and with the inspections and transparency that allow us to monitor the Iranian program. For this reason, I believe it would be irresponsible to walk away from this deal. But on such a tough issue, it is important that the American people and their representatives in Congress get a full opportunity to review the deal. After all, the details matter. And we’ve had some of the finest nuclear scientists in the world working through those details. And we’re dealing with a country — Iran — that has been a sworn adversary of the United States for over 35 years. So I welcome a robust debate in Congress on this issue, and I welcome scrutiny of the details of this agreement. But I will remind Congress that you don’t make deals like this with your friends. We negotiated arms control agreements with the Soviet Union when that nation was committed to our destruction. And those agreements ultimately made us safer. I am confident that this deal will meet the national security interest of the United States and our allies. So I will veto any legislation that prevents the successful implementation of this deal. We do not have to accept an inevitable spiral into conflict. And we certainly shouldn’t seek it. And precisely because the stakes are so high, this is not the time for politics or posturing. Tough talk from Washington does not solve problems. Hard-nosed diplomacy, leadership that has united the world’s major powers offers a more effective way to verify that Iran is not pursuing a nuclear weapon. Now, that doesn’t mean that this deal will resolve all of our differences with Iran. We share the concerns expressed by many of our friends in the Middle East, including Israel and the Gulf states, about Iran’s support for terrorism and its use of proxies to destabilize the region. But that is precisely why we are taking this step — because an Iran armed with a nuclear weapon would be far more destabilizing and far more dangerous to our friends and to the world. Meanwhile, we will maintain our own sanctions related to Iran’s support for terrorism, its ballistic missile program, and its human rights violations. We will continue our unprecedented efforts to strengthen Israel’s security — efforts that go beyond what any American administration has done before. And we will continue the work we began at Camp David to elevate our partnership with the Gulf States to strengthen their capabilities to counter threats from Iran or terrorist groups like ISIL. However, I believe that we must continue to test whether or not this region, which has known so much suffering, so much bloodshed, can move in a different direction. Time and again, I have made clear to the Iranian people that we will always be open to engagement on the basis of mutual interests and mutual respect. Our differences are real and the difficult history between our nations cannot be ignored. But it is possible to change. The path of violence and rigid ideology, a foreign policy based on threats to attack your neighbors or eradicate Israel — that’s a dead end. A different path, one of tolerance and peaceful resolution of conflict, leads to more integration into the global economy, more engagement with the international community, and the ability of the Iranian people to prosper and thrive. This deal offers an opportunity to move in a new direction. We should seize it. We have come a long way to reach this point — decades of an Iranian nuclear program, many years of sanctions, and many months of intense negotiation. Today, I want to thank the members of Congress from both parties who helped us put in place the sanctions that have proven so effective, as well as the other countries who joined us in that effort. I want to thank our negotiating partners — the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia, China, as well as the European Union — for our unity in this effort, which showed that the world can do remarkable things when we share a vision of peacefully addressing conflicts. We showed what we can do when we do not split apart. And finally, I want to thank the American negotiating team. We had a team of experts working for several weeks straight on this, including our energy secretarynergy, Ernie Moniz. And I want to particularly thank John Kerry, our secretary of state, who began his service to this country more than four decades ago when he put on our uniform and went off to war. He’s now making this country safer through his commitment to strong, principled American diplomacy. History shows that America must lead not just with our might, but with our principles. It shows we are stronger not when we are alone, but when we bring the world together. Today’s announcement marks one more chapter in this pursuit of a safer and more helpful and more hopeful world. Thank you. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. Advertisement
None	Advertisement  America's nuclear  deal with India is stalled as key Indian political parties reject what has been billed as one of the  Bush administration's biggest foreign policy achievements. As this happens, America inches toward war with Iran with no progress being made toward a negotiated solution. Both cases involve the challenge of nuclear proliferation. And in both cases the administration has missed an opportunity to make sensible progress, opting instead for an exaggerated approach resulting in a bad deal. In neither case should the United States be undercutting long-held nonproliferation doctrine. In both cases it should be promoting constructive engagement. In the case of India, George W. Bush is right to pursue stronger ties. But his administration was so eager for a deal that sufficient thought wasn't given to the implications of "an agreement at any cost" approach. As captured in Glenn Kessler's book, "The Confidante," professionals in the State Department would have preferred to pursue an agreement with India that would not undercut the incremental approach to nuclear cooperation. Advertisement Instead, the administration went for a deal that would abandon a three-decade long policy that had cautiously approached nuclear collaboration because India used a civilian nuclear program to produce fissile material for weapons. Advertisement The final agreement lays out a framework that would allow trade in nuclear reactors, technology, and fuel. It would permit India to reprocess nuclear fuel and open the way for the United States to become a "reliable" supplier for India's energy program. Critics said the deal had dangerous consequences for the ability of the U.S. to discourage the spread of nuclear weapons. There is growing recognition in Congress that the deal sets a bad example because India would win access to U.S. technology without complying with the Non-Proliferation Treaty. The agreement also is controversial in India, where close association with the United States is viewed with suspicion, and leftist parties want a degree of distance with it. With talks suspended until next month, the moral of this story is that strategic partnerships, while desirable, shouldn't be slapped together. Thoughtful dialogue and engagement can develop shared approaches to mutual challenges, despite differences that inevitably will continue. That's relevant to the case of Iran, where Bush was also right to reverse almost 30 years of U.S. policy that had forbidden direct engagement. But since that decision in spring 2005, the administration has barely met with any senior Iranian officials and politicians. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter. You must select a newsletter to subscribe to. Nor has it had contact with the vibrant Iranian society, which in terms of demographics, education and perhaps even international orientation could one day soon emulate the evolution of Turkey. Hints by the administration at "World War III" inhibit any constructive atmosphere and context for negotiations that could make that option unnecessary. The U.S. "negotiating" posture of demonizing and criticizing the Iranian regime stands in sharp contrast with bilateral and multilateral negotiations with North Korea. If the negotiations with North Korea prove successful and enduring, they are in some ways a model as to how to negotiate with Iran. The North was more defiant than Iran and confronted the United States head on, stating openly that it sought to have, and indeed did have, nuclear weapons. Despite the odious rhetoric of Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the starting point with Tehran is in some ways easier, which as of yet does not have a weapon, and claims that it does not want to develop one. There are those like Defense Secretary Robert Gates who bring a constructive mind-set to the debate within the administration. Gates cochaired a Council on Foreign Relations task force in 2003 that concluded that direct dialogue without restrictions would serve Iran's interests and achieve U.S. objectives. Advertisement More important, the task force's report noted that the United States and Iran need not wait for "absolute harmony" between governments: While relations cannot be normalized without a commitment to abandoning nuclear weapons and abandoning support for terrorist groups, those requirements should not be preconditions for dialogue. That's a better approach than one involving artificial deadlines, name-calling, and saber-rattling, which are destructive to getting any negotiating process underway. Both in the case of India and Iran, exaggerated positions replaced patient engagement and the cultivation of a constructive atmosphere to pursue realistic goals. A version of this article appears in print on October 29, 2007, in The International Herald Tribune.  We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
Iran and 6 Powers Agree on Terms for Nuclear Talks	Advertisement Supported by By  VIENNA — In what officials described as a serious, workmanlike and conversational atmosphere, Iran and six world powers have agreed on a timetable and framework for negotiating a comprehensive agreement to end the confrontation over Iran’s nuclear program, the European Union’s foreign policy chief and Iran’s foreign minister said Thursday. While details were vague and the two delegation leaders declined to take questions at a closing news conference, they said that groups of experts would meet early in March and that the full delegations would meet again on March 17, with the expectation that they would meet monthly. Catherine Ashton, the European Union’s foreign policy chief, said: “We had three very productive days during which we have identified all the issues we need to address to reach a comprehensive and final agreement. There is a lot to do. It won’t be easy, but we have made a good start.” Officials refused to describe the topics for the expert meetings, but a senior American official, speaking on the condition of anonymity under the session’s ground rules, said, “Every issue of concern to us is on the table,” including uranium enrichment, Iran’s heavy-water reactor project and its suspected nuclear military research and ballistic missile program. All these issues, the official said, including clarifying the issue of Iran’s past military research, are at least mentioned in a joint plan of action agreed upon with Iran in November in Geneva. “All our concerns must be met to get an agreement,” said the American official, defining Washington’s goals as ensuring that Iran does not develop a nuclear weapon and that world powers can be confident that Iran’s nuclear program has no military aspect or intent, as Iran maintains. The care that officials on all sides took not to say anything very specific was striking, as was the positive atmosphere they described in the meetings themselves, which were said by one official to have no element of political rhetoric or posturing, even over “areas of difficulty.” It was clear that most of the work here was about setting an agenda and establishing the priority of the issues at stake, without entering into a substantive discussion of those issues. Iranian officials have said publicly that only their nuclear program is on the agenda, not their larger military structure, and that they will not dismantle any part of their nuclear program or give up what they have called their right to modernize it. American officials have emphasized that large parts of Iran’s “nuclear infrastructure” will have to be dismantled, as opposed to simply disabled, as part of a final deal. A six-month deal to essentially freeze Iran’s program in return for modest relief from sanctions and the release of some frozen assets expires on July 20. The officials said they had planned meetings throughout the next four months, but wanted to leave the last month free because talks tend to accelerate and intensify closer to deadlines. “This is going to be both a marathon and a sprint at the same time,” the American official said. The six-month deal can be extended if both sides agree. The Iranians also suggested that Ms. Ashton might visit Iran before the March 17 meeting. She leads the talks for the six world powers: the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council — the United States, Britain, France, Russia and China — plus Germany. Western officials and experts concede that Iran will have an enrichment program, but they want to constrain and control it to ensure that Iran cannot build a nuclear weapon quickly or undetected. They want some formula that limits the level of enrichment; caps the stockpiles of enriched uranium; dismantles or decommissions a large number of Iran’s centrifuges, machines that enrich uranium; removes the possibility that the heavy-water reactor will produce plutonium; and allows a deeper level of inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency, which monitors compliance with the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, signed by Iran. The atomic agency said in a report published on Thursday that Iran was meeting its commitments under the six-month deal. The report said that enrichment of uranium to “medium levels” had stopped, and that a part of Iran’s stockpile of that uranium “is being down-blended, and the remainder is being converted to uranium oxide,” as the deal requires. Enrichment to lower levels continues, the agency said, but no additional centrifuges have been installed, and work has been suspended at the Arak heavy-water reactor. The head of the American delegation, Wendy R. Sherman, will travel on Thursday from Vienna to brief allies in Jerusalem; Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; and two of the United Arab Emirates, Abu Dhabi and Dubai, while telephoning other allies and members of the United States Congress. But the Israeli government, in a statement released Thursday, argued that the interim agreement had not brought about “any change in Iran’s nuclear program.” “For a civilian nuclear program there is no need for centrifuges and no need for a heavy-water reactor,” it said. Isabel Kershner contributed reporting from Jerusalem. Advertisement
Saudis Should Welcome the Iran Deal	Advertisement Supported by Op-Ed Contributor By  WASHINGTON — Saudi Arabia and its Sunni allies in the Gulf tremble at the prospect of a final nuclear deal with Iran. They fear it will let Iran stir even more trouble than it already is stirring in Yemen, Iraq and Syria. But is that fear misplaced? Yes. President Obama, who has invited these Arab leaders to meet at Camp David this spring, would do well to use the opportunity to assure them of that. He should stress that a final nuclear deal is much likelier to make the Arab world more secure for a decade or more, by preventing Iran from getting near a “breakout” — the ability to produce enough bomb-grade material to become a nuclear power. And that would give the whole region time to address the real cause of its instability: the lack of effective pluralist government in fragile states throughout the Levant, the Arabian Peninsula and North Africa. Fixing that gap requires time to resolve internal political divisions left over from the 20th century. And time to pursue that goal is one likely outcome of the formula reached in Lausanne, Switzerland, last month, particularly if it also promotes Iran’s reintegration with the global economy. That alone has potential to temper Iran’s foreign policy in the region. So far, the Arab countries have operated on a logic precisely opposite. They assume that Iranian interference is the principal cause of their instability, and that Iran is incorrigibly aggressive. Therefore, Iran must be confronted at every turn and rolled back now. Holding open any path toward any nuclear capacity, even far in the future, is too dangerous. For example, Saudi Arabia and its allies blame Iranian machinations for the crisis in Yemen, even though Yemen has suffered ethnic violence for decades. And their worst fear is of the day when the possibility of making a bomb would make Iran invulnerable. So they are using the Yemen conflict to push back against any expansion of Iranian influence. The flaw in that strategy is that it is probably counterproductive. It adds Yemen to a growing list, headed by Syria and Libya, of countries where the Arabs are already committed to difficult proxy wars. Leaving aside the question of how many conflicts can be sustained at one time, the strategy only deepens the region’s sectarian, tribal and ethnic divides. And that further increases Iran’s appetite for nuclear-based clout. With that in mind, getting Iran to slow its progress toward nuclear capability for 10 to 15 years is a far better way to deny it strategic advantages down the road. Let’s face it: The Middle East’s center has imploded. Its crisis is deeply rooted in local instabilities and will continue for some time. Failed states from Libya to Yemen to Syria have set the stage for raging civil wars, extremist insurgencies and sectarian conflicts, all bound to regional rivalries. So long as the pattern is escalating violence rather than political negotiation to establish functional governments, Shiite forces vying for power in the conflicted states will seek Iran’s patronage. And even if Sunni Arab states then support their own friends, Iran will have exploited the collapse of the Arab order to expand its own reach. Saudi leaders’ faith in a military approach to Iran is also linked to their lack of faith that Iran will keep any nuclear deal. But if the Lausanne framework does not produce a final agreement, the United States and its allies will have little choice but to intensify economic sanctions on Iran. And that would sharpen the threat to the Arab states by stiffening Iran’s resolve to hasten its nuclear development and resist monitoring. In other words, the Arab strategy would shorten the time Iran needed for breakout — not just to a bomb, but to an arsenal. Contrary to some fears, nuclear war would not be the most likely outcome of an Iranian breakout, even if it pushed Saudi Arabia or Egypt to pursue bomb capacity themselves. Israeli and Arab rulers understand that the Middle East is more likely to settle into a “nuclear peace” like the Cold War — rivalry pursued through asymmetric warfare by or against proxy armies. In that game, Iran already has the advantage of experience and a long reach. Indeed, Iran spends far less on its military than Israel, Turkey or the Persian Gulf Arab monarchies, and a vast technological gap separates its conventional weapons from those of its rivals. But Iran makes up for that with a network of irregular fighters and armed militias trained, financed and managed by its Revolutionary Guards. That is what lets Iran menace Israel on its borders, keep the Assad regime afloat in Syria, help Iraq fight the Islamic State and sustain rebellion in Yemen. And Iran would, indeed, be even freer to do so if it had a nuclear bomb. The logical conclusion, then, is to use whatever time can be mustered now to shore up the economic vitality and political unity of the Arab countries while Iran is seeking readmission to the global economy. In that way, the Middle East countries could reduce drastically Iran’s opportunities to meddle in their internal politics. This is not just theory. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union, despite its huge conventional military, was held at bay in Western Europe not only by American nuclear weapons, but also by the strength of Western Europe’s economy and political systems. The deal that the United States and its partners have outlined with Iran would not eliminate Iran’s nuclear program. But it would allow the rest of the Middle East an opportunity to fortify itself with a new political order. And that goal is what the Arab states, allied with America, must devote themselves to, once a near-term breakout by Iran has been taken off the table in a final nuclear deal.   Opinion Advertisement
Congress Responds Cautiously to Framework, and Demands Right to Review Deal	Advertisement Supported by By  and WASHINGTON — Leading lawmakers from both parties in Congress responded cautiously on Thursday to the for a nuclear deal between Western powers and Iran, demanding to review any final agreement but pointedly refraining from a vow to kill the accord. Congress could still scuttle a deal if lawmakers move forward with tough new sanctions on Iran just as economic and nuclear penalties are supposed to be lifted. And Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the panel would continue with plans to formally draft bipartisan legislation on April 14 insisting on congressional examination of any agreement. The committee’s leadership was looking for ways to shape a bill that would gain broad approval in both parties. “We want the right to go through the details of the deal and to decide whether we believe congressionally mandated sanctions should be alleviated,” Mr. Corker said in an interview. That sentiment was bipartisan. “If Congress appears to be bypassed, that’s not good for the national debate and national unity as we move forward with Iran,” said Representative Eliot L. Engel of New York, the ranking Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Committee. President Obama made a pointed appeal to Congress to let diplomacy work, even as he promised consultation. “If Congress kills this deal — not based on expert analysis, and without offering any reasonable alternative — then it’s the United States that will be blamed for the failure of diplomacy,” he said at the White House. “International unity will collapse, and the path to conflict will widen.” But a senior administration official hinted at compromise, at least on the review legislation. He reiterated the president’s promise to veto legislation imposing new sanctions on Iran, but said that a previous veto threat on the congressional review bill applied only to the measure as it was originally drafted. The jousting is likely to continue for months, and pressure could mount on Republican leaders to toughen their stand. Negotiators must turn a framework into a detailed agreement by this summer, and legal sanctions imposed by the United States will not have to be lifted anytime soon, possibly not for years. The agreement is not likely to require action from Congress until the next presidential administration. But beyond the leadership suites, a more hard-edge response came quickly. “The Obama administration’s efforts to get a deal at any cost will have a greater cost than the world can bear,” said Representative Michael McCaul of Texas, the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee. “If this deal moves forward, the consequences for the U.S. and our allies in the region will be dire.” Some Democrats hailed it. “We’ve set the stage for a paradigm shift in the country and in the region,” said Representative Earl Blumenauer, Democrat of Oregon. But other Democrats tried to find a middle ground between embracing the accord and undermining it. Senator Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, said that he wanted unanimity around Congress’s request for review, and that aspects of the legislation would have to be toned down. Iran and six world powers agreed on key parameters for an accord regarding Tehran’s nuclear program, with the details to be negotiated by June 30. The bill demands that the administration submit the full text of any agreement to Congress, including classified annexes. It would prohibit the removal of any congressional sanctions for 60 days after a final accord, and would require the president to certify Iranian compliance every 90 days. Without that certification, it mandates a quick return of sanctions. The original version was written by Mr. Corker and Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, a hard-liner on the Iran talks. But Wednesday on corruption charges, and his decision to step down from the top Democratic spot on the Foreign Relations Committee, elevated the more diplomatic voice of Mr. Cardin. “The more unity we can have among Democrats and the White House, the stronger U.S. foreign policy will be,” Mr. Cardin said. In general, the most senior Republicans, while cool to the deal, spoke in measured tones. “In the weeks ahead, Republicans and Democrats in Congress will continue to press this administration on the details of these parameters and the tough questions that remain unanswered,” said the House speaker, John A. Boehner of Ohio. “We will stand strong on behalf of the American people and everyone in the Middle East who values freedom, security and peace.” A guide to help you navigate the deal between global powers and Tehran. The biggest question is not about the congressional review legislation but about whether Republican leaders will try to resurrect House and Senate measures that would impose tough new sanctions on Iran. Both versions have had broad bipartisan support, but their passage could imperil a final deal. “There will be a move to apply new sanctions or deprive the president of the ability to waive existing sanctions,” said Representative Brad Sherman, Democrat of California and a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. While that inclination is present in both chambers and in both parties, he said, “the tendency will be to vote for or against the president based on party.” Mr. Obama, announcing the tentative accord in the White House Rose Garden, said the issues at stake were “bigger than politics.” “These are matters of war and peace, and they should be evaluated based on the facts and what is ultimately best for the American people and for our national security,” he said. But lawmakers in both parties asked pointed questions about the framework presented. Mr. Corker said that he believed sanctions would be lifted too quickly, and that he wanted to better understand what would happen to Iran’s fissile nuclear materials. Mr. Engel was pleased that Iran’s array of centrifuges would be reduced by two-thirds, and that inspections of uranium mining and milling would last 25 years. “But tell me why Fordo remains open,” he said, referring to Iran’s underground enrichment site. “Why not just destroy it?” Julie Hirschfeld Davis contributed reporting.

Iranian Minister Says Nuclear Deal Is Possible This Week	Advertisement Supported by By  PARIS — Two days before negotiations resume in Geneva between Iran and the United States and other Western powers aimed at ending a fight over the disputed Iranian nuclear program, the country’s foreign minister sounded an optimistic note on Tuesday, saying a deal was possible as soon as this week. “I believe it is even possible to reach that agreement this week,” Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said in an interview with France 24, a major television network here, before meeting with the French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius. “But I can only talk for our side,” Mr. Zarif added. “I cannot talk for the other side.” Iran has been on an outreach mission since of Hassan Rouhani, who appears to have made getting rid of painful economic sanctions a centerpiece of his policy. The country now appears willing both to discuss the enforcement of more comprehensive controls on its nuclear program and to answer outstanding questions from the United Nations’ atomic energy arm, the International Atomic Energy Agency, about its program. At the last , Iran announced that it had offered a framework for talks, and the approach was well received by American officials. However, the parties are still far from a deal, which would have multiple elements and would have to satisfy even countries that are not directly involved in the negotiations, like Israel, which has long feared that Iran is pursuing a nuclear weapon secretly, regardless of what it says publicly. Iran has always insisted that its program is peaceful and will be used only to generate electricity and for medical purposes. However, Iran has achieved the ability to enrich uranium up to 20 percent purity, and it is then relatively easy to increase enrichment to 90 percent, at which point it can be used to make a nuclear weapon, according to atomic experts. Those involved in the Geneva talks include the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council — the United States, China, Russia, France and England — as well as Germany. For the United States, the opening offered by Mr. Rouhani is a rare chance to change the tone of relations between the West and Iran. If Iran is truly willing to give verifiable guarantees that it will not pursue a nuclear weapon, then the United States might be willing to lead an effort to lift the sanctions. It would also allow the United States to engage more deeply with Iran over the violent situation in Syria, in which Iran has backed President Bashar al-Assad against the rebels fighting to overthrow him.

Behind Trump’s Termination of Iran Deal Is a Risky Bet	Advertisement Supported by News Analysis By  and WASHINGTON — For President Trump and two of the allies he values most — Israel and Saudi Arabia — the problem of the Iranian nuclear accord was not, primarily, about nuclear weapons. It was that the deal legitimized and normalized Iran’s clerical government, reopening it to the world economy with oil revenue that financed its adventures in Syria and Iraq, its missile program and its support of terrorist groups. Now, by announcing on Tuesday that he is exiting the nuclear deal and will reimpose economic sanctions on Iran and companies around the world that do business with the country, Mr. Trump is engaged in a grand, highly risky experiment. Mr. Trump and his Middle East allies are betting they can cut Iran’s economic lifeline and thus “break the regime,” as one senior European official described the effort. In theory, America’s withdrawal could free Iran to produce as much nuclear material as it wants — as it was doing five years ago, when the world feared that it was headed toward a bomb. But Mr. Trump’s team dismisses that risk: Iran does not have the economic strength to confront the United States, Israel and Saudi Arabia. And Iran knows that any move to produce a weapon would only provide Israel and the United States with a rationale for taking military action. It is a brutally realpolitik approach that America’s allies in Europe have warned is a historic mistake, one that could lead to confrontation, and perhaps to war. And it is a clear example of Middle East brinkmanship that runs counter to what President Barack Obama intended when the nuclear deal was struck in July 2015. Mr. Obama’s gamble in that deal — the signature foreign policy accord of his eight years in office — was straightforward. He regarded Iran as potentially a more natural ally of the United States than many of its Sunni-dominant neighbors, with a young, educated Western-oriented population that is tired of being ruled by an aging theocracy. By taking the prospect of nuclear weapons off the table, the Obama administration had argued, the United States and Iran could chip away at three decades of hostility and work on common projects, starting with the defeat of the Islamic State. It did not turn out that way. While the deal succeeded in getting 97 percent of Iran’s nuclear material out of the country, Iran’s conservatives and its military recoiled at the idea of cooperating on any projects with the West. Months before it became clear that Mr. Trump had a decent shot at being elected, the Iranian military increased support for President Bashar al-Assad in Syria; it expanded its influence in Iraq and accelerated its support for terrorist groups. And it doubled down on deploying cyberattacks against targets in the West and in Saudi Arabia, embracing a weapon that was not covered by the nuclear accord. Then came Mr. Trump, with his declaration that the deal was a “disaster” and his vow to dismantle it. That is exactly what he has now done, but at a huge cost. Moments after he delivered his statement — in which he made it sound as if Iran was cheating on the accord, even though his intelligence chiefs have testified otherwise — Mr. Trump received a stinging rebuke from Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain, President Emmanuel Macron of France and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany. The three leaders, America’s closest European allies, essentially rejected his logic. They noted that the United Nations Security Council resolution that embraced the Iran deal in 2016 “remains the binding international legal framework for the resolution of the dispute about the Iranian nuclear program.” That was polite diplomatic language for the stark conclusion that it is the United States — not Iran — that first violated the accord. And now, suddenly, the world may well be headed back to where it was in 2012: on a road to uncertain confrontation, with “very little evidence of a Plan B,” as Boris Johnson, the British foreign minister, said on a visit to Washington. Exiting the deal, with or without a plan, is fine with the Saudis. They see the accord as a dangerous distraction from the real problem of confronting Iran around the region — a problem that Saudi Arabia believes will be solved only by leadership change in Iran. The Saudis have an ally in John R. Bolton, the president’s new national security adviser, who had made clear before taking office that he shared their view. Mr. Obama’s deal, Mr. Bolton said on Tuesday afternoon, featured “an utterly inadequate treatment of the military dimension of Iran’s aspirations.” The Saudi case against Iran has been bolstered in recent months by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has repeatedly referred to Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, as “the new Hitler.” “Many countries around the world and in Europe did not realize how dangerous Hitler was until what happened, happened,” Prince Mohammed said in a recent interview with the CBS News program “60 Minutes.” “I don’t want to see the same events happening in the Middle East.” In a speech in March at the Brookings Institution, Adel al-Jubeir, the Saudi foreign minister, asserted that Iran was “the biggest problem we face in our region.” He blamed Iran for interfering in neighboring countries, backing allied armed groups in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, Yemen and elsewhere, and supplying Yemeni rebels with ballistic missiles they fired at his country. Even if its restrictions on nuclear weapons were tightened and extended, “the agreement by itself does not solve the problem of Iran,” Mr. Jubeir said. “Iran must be held accountable.” Jeremy Shapiro, research director at the European Council on Foreign Relations and a State Department official during the Obama administration, argued that the nuclear deal’s opposition from Saudi Arabia, Israel and other regional players was primarily about its effects on American politics and policy. “They believe they are in this existential conflict with the Iranian regime, and nuclear weapons are a small part of that conflict” — but the one that most influences public opinion in the United States, Mr. Shapiro said. “If the deal opened an avenue for better relations between the United States and Iran, that would be a disaster for the Saudis,” he said. “They need to ensure a motivation for American pressure against Iran that will last even after this administration.” Israel is a more complicated case. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has pressed Mr. Trump to abandon an arrangement that the Israeli leader has always detested. But Mr. Netanyahu’s own military and intelligence advisers say Israel is far safer with an Iran whose pathway to a bomb is blocked, rather than one that is once again pursuing the ultimate weapon. “The individuals who shoulder responsibility for Israel’s survival and security have been crystal clear,” Graham Allison, a Harvard professor who has spent his career examining cases of nuclear proliferation. “This will most likely lead to an outcome that is much worse not only for the U.S., but for Israel,’’ Mr. Allison said, because the current agreement rolled Iran’s nuclear program back a decade “and imposed on Iran the most intrusive inspection regime ever negotiated.” But Mr. Netanyahu holds Israel’s bullhorn, and he used it last week to persuade Mr. Trump to pull the plug on the Iran deal. By releasing Iranian documents, stolen from Tehran in January, Mr. Netanyahu proved what Western intelligence agencies long knew: A decade ago or even longer, the Iranians were working hard to design a nuclear warhead. To Mr. Netanyahu, this was proof that Iran could never be trusted and that it had reached the nuclear deal under false pretenses by pretending it never had a weapons program. To Mr. Trump and his allies, the Israeli discovery said less about Iranian nuclear capability than it did about Iranian perfidy. Given evidence that Iran was preserving its bomb designs as a hedge for the future, the discovery suggested it has not given up its ambitions. As Dennis Ross, a former Middle East negotiator, put it, someone needed to address the Israeli discovery “lest they give the Iranians the ability to pick up quickly where they left off on weaponizing.” Still, at the core of Mr. Trump’s announcement on Tuesday is a conviction that Mr. Obama made a critical mistake in agreeing to a deal that contains an expiration date. Mr. Trump’s argument is that Iran can never be allowed to accumulate enough material to assemble a bomb. So when the Europeans said that would require reopening the negotiations, Mr. Trump balked, and decided instead to scrap the entire deal. It was a classic Trumpian move, akin to the days when he would knock down New York buildings to make way for visions of grander, more glorious edifices. But in this case, it is about upsetting a global power balance and weakening a government that Mr. Trump has argued, since he began campaigning, must go.

Curtail Iran and Win	Advertisement Supported by By  LONDON — As a deadline nears for a possible deal with Iran on its nuclear program, discussion is being clouded by false debate. A curtailment camp that sees a viable avenue to ring-fencing limited Iranian enrichment so that the country cannot acquire a bomb confronts a dismantlement camp that believes any deal is bad and every Iranian centrifuge must go. The Obama administration officials leading the talks are committed curtailers. They seek a tough deal involving intensive verification over an extended period of a much-reduced enrichment program compatible only with civilian nuclear energy and assuring that Iran is kept at least one year from any potential “breakout” to bomb manufacture. The dismantlers, who believe a deal would be disastrous, are led by Benjamin Netanyahu with strong support in the Republican-controlled Congress, even before the Israeli prime minister addresses a joint session early next month. Netanyahu, whose planned visit has angered Obama, argues that he has an “obligation to speak up on a matter that affects the very survival of my country.” The falseness of the debate lies in the disingenuousness of the dismantlers. Iran has mastered the fuel cycle. This may be regrettable but is no less true for that. It did so before Obama took office. The country knows its way around basic enrichment technology. Thousands of centrifuges are spinning, although many fewer than would have been without the effective interim agreement concluded in late 2013. What then does it mean to dismantle knowledge? You can’t bomb a people’s knowledge out of existence. Yet this in essence is what the dismantlers propose. In reality, the dismantlement camp favors escalation that makes a calamitous conflict with Iran more likely; it is a war camp. Iran, a signatory of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, will not voluntarily eliminate a nuclear program that is a source of national pride and to which it believes it has a right. Baloney, the dismantlers say, the country can be sanctioned to its knees — and Senators Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, and Mark Kirk, Republican of Illinois, have a sanctions bill readied in an attempt to prove just that (Obama has said he will veto it). The sanction-and-dismantle devotees are deluded. Sanctions have hurt Iran, but the country is largely inured to them. That leaves bombing Iran in an attempt to achieve dismantlement. Yet even optimistic assessments suggest the most a military campaign might achieve is setting the Iranian program back a couple of years. It would also lead the United States into a war with the sworn Shiite enemies of Sunni ISIS just as America and its allies do battle with the Islamic State, as well as place Israel at war with Persians and Arabs for the first time. As double whammies in folly go, this would be up there. Wise counsel to the dismantlers would run as follows: “In a perfect world Iran would have no enrichment program, but life’s not perfect. This situation comes down to alternatives. Either you get a negotiated solution that ensures over some 15 years that Iran’s program is strictly limited, at least a year from breakout, with eyes and ears on the ground you’ve never had before, and the plutonium path to a bomb cut off by the transformation of the Arak research reactor — or you go for military action. And what would war achieve? It may set the program back some, but it will ensure that Iran goes for a bomb, inflame anti-Western sentiment in the Muslim world, and see the current international coalition for sanctions fall apart. That is not good for anyone, including Israel.” A tough nuclear deal, of the kind sought by Obama, would enhance Israeli security. War with Iran would undermine it. A little over a month remains until a March 24 deadline for at least the “political framework” of a deal. The main differences, I am told, are over an unrealistic Iranian demand that all sanctions be lifted at once if a deal is reached, and over cuts or modifications to the almost 10,000 operating centrifuges. Because Western officials believe Iran is prepared to send almost all its current stockpile to Russia, which would set back its “breakout” potential, there is more American flexibility on the number of centrifuges. Still, the number would probably need to be at least halved. These are real but not insurmountable differences. Ushering Iran toward the world through a rigorous deal would have enormous political and economic benefits. As Mohammad Javad Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister, said recently: “We need to seize this opportunity. It may not be repeated.” It remains to be seen if Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme Iranian leader, is in “seizing” mode. He’s not the only hard-liner. The dismantlers seek another unwinnable war. They cloak their intent with irresponsible talk of a deal as another Munich. Their argument is false. The curtailers are realistic. They are right. It’s far better to circumscribe enrichment than spur it — and possibly an Iranian bomb — through impossible dismantlement demands. You can follow me on or join me on . Advertisement
Trump Abandons Iran Nuclear Deal He Long Scorned	Advertisement Supported by By  WASHINGTON — President Trump declared on Tuesday that he was withdrawing from the nuclear deal, unraveling the signature foreign policy achievement of his predecessor Barack Obama, isolating the United States from its Western allies and sowing uncertainty before a risky nuclear negotiation with North Korea. The decision, while long anticipated and widely telegraphed, leaves the reached by seven countries after more than two years of grueling negotiations in tatters. The United States will now reimpose the stringent sanctions it imposed on Iran before the deal and is considering new penalties. said it will remain in the deal, which tightly restricted its nuclear ambitions for a decade or more in return for ending the sanctions that had crippled its economy. So did France, Germany and Britain, raising the prospect of a trans-Atlantic clash as European companies face the return of American sanctions for doing business with Iran. China and Russia, also signatories to the deal, are likely to join Iran in accusing the United States of violating the accord. Mr. Trump’s move could embolden hard-line forces in Iran, raising the threat of Iranian retaliation against Israel or the United States, fueling an arms race in the Middle East and fanning sectarian conflicts from Syria to Yemen. The president, however, framed his decision as the fulfillment of a bedrock campaign promise and as the act of a dealmaker dissolving a fatally flawed agreement. He predicted his tough line with Iran would strengthen his hand as he prepared to meet North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, to begin negotiating the surrender of his nuclear arsenal. “This was a horrible one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made,” a grim-faced Mr. Trump said in an 11-minute address from the Diplomatic Reception Room of the White House. “It didn’t bring calm, it didn’t bring peace, and it never will.” announcement drew a chorus of opposition from European leaders, several of whom lobbied him feverishly not to pull out of the agreement and searched for fixes to it that would satisfy him. It also drew a rare public rebuke by Mr. Obama, who said Mr. Trump’s withdrawal would leave the world less safe, confronting it with “a losing choice between a nuclear-armed Iran or another war in the Middle East.” The response from Iran itself, however, was muted. President Hassan Rouhani declared that the Iranians intended to abide by the terms of the deal, and he criticized Mr. Trump for his history of not honoring international treaties. Mr. Trump won strong backing from Saudi Arabia and Israel, whose leader, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, hailed him for a “historic move” and “courageous leadership.” The restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program under the deal could survive. Three times previously, the president’s aides had persuaded him not to dismantle the Iran deal. But Mr. Trump made clear that his patience had worn thin, and with a new, more hawkish cohort of advisers — led by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the national security adviser, John R. Bolton — the president faced less internal resistance than earlier in his administration. While Mr. Trump had long scorned the Iran deal, threatening repeatedly to rip it up during the 2016 presidential race, his impulse to act now was reinforced by what he views as the success of his policy toward North Korea. He has told aides and foreign leaders that his policy of maximum pressure had forced Mr. Kim to the bargaining table, and that a similar policy of overwhelming pressure would enable the United States to extract a better deal from Iran. As Mr. Trump abandoned one diplomatic project, he accelerated another — announcing that Mr. Pompeo was flying to Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea, to continue discussions with Mr. Kim about the upcoming summit meeting. He expressed hope that three Americans who are detained in the North would be released soon. “The message to North Korea,” Mr. Bolton told reporters, “is the president wants a real deal.” He rejected the suggestion that the United States could not be trusted to keep its agreements when political winds change. “Any nation reserves the right to correct a past mistake,” Mr. Bolton said, citing President George W. Bush’s decision to withdraw from the Antiballistic Missile Treaty in 2001. The Trump administration, he said, would continue to work with Europeans to pressure the Iranians. He dismissed those who said the United States was on a path to war with Iran, though he did not present any new diplomatic initiatives. Another senior administration official acknowledged that there was no Plan B. Months of intense negotiations with the Europeans to keep the accord in place collapsed over Mr. Trump’s insistence that the limits placed by the agreement on Iran’s nuclear fuel production were inadequate. Under the provisions of the deal, those limits, or “sunset clauses,” were to expire in 2030 — 15 years after the deal was signed. As a result, the United States will reinstate all the sanctions it had waived as part of the nuclear accord, and it will impose additional economic penalties that are now being drawn up by the Treasury Department. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin declined on Tuesday to specify what additional sanctions the United States might impose, but he expressed confidence that they would still be powerful even if other American allies did not follow suit. “We do not want to let Iran use the U.S. financial markets and financial system and transact in dollars until they agree that not only will they not have a nuclear weapon now, but we’ve put in provisions that they will never have one,” Mr. Mnuchin said. In his announcement, Mr. Trump recited familiar arguments against the deal: that it does not address the threat of Iran’s ballistic missiles or its malign behavior in the region, and that the expiration dates for the sunset clauses open the door to an Iranian nuclear bomb down the road. Even if Iran was in compliance, he said, it could “still be on the verge of a nuclear breakout in just a short period of time.” In fact, under the deal, the limits on Iran’s uranium enrichment and stockpiles of nuclear fuel mean that Iran would not be on the verge of a nuclear breakout until 2030. Still, Mr. Trump said, the United States and its allies could not stop Iran from building a nuclear weapon “under the decaying and rotten structure of the current agreement.” “The Iran deal is defective at its core,” he concluded. Mr. Trump’s announcement capped a frantic four-day period in which American and European diplomats made a last-ditch effort to bridge their differences and preserve the agreement. That effort began Friday, when Mr. Pompeo called his counterparts in Europe to tell them that Mr. Trump was planning to withdraw from the deal, but that he was trying to win a two-week reprieve for the United States and Europe to continue negotiating. Mr. Pompeo, people familiar with the talks said, suggested that he favored a so-called soft withdrawal, in which Mr. Trump would pull out of the deal but hold off on reimposing some of the sanctions. The next day, the State Department’s chief negotiator, Brian H. Hook, consulted with European diplomats to try to break a deadlock over the sunset provision, under which the restrictions on Iran’s ability to produce nuclear fuel for civilian use expire after 15 years. The Europeans had already agreed to a significant compromise: to reimpose sanctions if there were a determination that the Iranians were within 12 months of producing a nuclear weapon. But officials said that still did not satisfy Mr. Trump, and the Europeans were not willing to go any further. By Monday, the White House began informing allies that Mr. Trump was going to withdraw from the deal and reimpose sanctions on oil and impose new sanctions against the Central Bank of Iran. Under the financial sanctions, European companies will have 90 to 180 days to wind down their operations in Iran, or they will run afoul of the American banking system. The sanctions on oil will require European and Asian countries to reduce their imports from Iran. Mr. Mnuchin insisted that the restrictions would not drive up oil prices because other suppliers would pick up the slack. “My expectation is not that oil prices go higher,” he said. “To a certain extent, some of this was already in the market on oil prices.” Mr. Trump’s decision will test his already frayed relationship with European leaders. President Emmanuel Macron of France, whom the president welcomed with a state dinner two weeks ago, learned of his decision in a phone call with Mr. Trump on Tuesday morning. Later, he said in a that the European allies “regret” his decision. “The international regime against nuclear proliferation is at stake,” he added. In a joint statement, Mr. Macron, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain noted pointedly that the United Nations Security Council resolution endorsing the nuclear deal remained the “binding international legal framework for the resolution of the dispute.” That raises the possibility that the United States will be found to be in violation in the Security Council. Few people were more stung by Mr. Trump’s decision than those who worked for Mr. Obama. Though he has moved methodically to dismantle his predecessor’s legacy, his reversal of the Iran deal was particularly painful, given the five years of effort that went into imposing sanctions, and the more than two-year-long negotiation led by Secretary of State John Kerry that yielded the accord. “No rhetoric is required,” Mr. Kerry said in a statement. “The facts speak for themselves. Instead of building on unprecedented nonproliferation verification measures, this decision risks throwing them away and dragging the world back to the brink we faced a few years ago.” Reporting was contributed by Peter Baker, Alan Rappeport, David E.

            Please send reports of such problems to  Iran and China signed an agreement Sunday to build a nuclear power plant near Teheran, Etellat newspaper reported today. In a joint statement issued by the official Iranian press agency, IRNA, Chinese officials said it was "the dawn of a new era of commercial and technical cooperation" for the two countries. Iran has aggressively sought access in the last two years to nuclear technology, with mixed success, in what is believed to be an attempt to develop nuclear weapons. Teheran has maintained that its nuclear activities are for "peaceful purposes" and within the framework of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. But officials from the International Atomic Energy Agency visited last year, and they did not rule out a full-scale inspection. The agreement with the Chinese was the first official deal for foreign assistance in building an atomic power plant in Iran. Germany, Argentina, Brazil and others have turned Iran down under pressure from the United States. Iran says the 300-megawatt plant will provide electricity and reduce regular blackouts across the country. According to state-run reports, China is to receive payment for the project in oil, steel and a series of unspecified Iranian-made products. A version of this article appears in print on July 7, 1993, on Page A00006 of the with the headline: China in Pact to Help Iran Build A-Plant. 
G.O.P. Senators’ Letter to Iran About Nuclear Deal Angers White House	Advertisement Supported by By  WASHINGTON — The fractious debate over a possible nuclear deal with Iran escalated on Monday as 47 Republican senators warned Iran about making an agreement with President Obama, and the White House accused them of undercutting foreign policy. In a rare direct congressional intervention into diplomatic negotiations, the Republicans signed an addressed to “leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran” declaring that any agreement without legislative approval could be reversed by the next president “with the stroke of a pen.” The letter appeared aimed at unraveling a framework agreement even as negotiators grew close to reaching it. Mr. Obama, working with leaders of five other world powers, argues that the pact would be the best way to keep Iran from obtaining a nuclear bomb. But critics from both parties say that such a deal would be a dangerous charade that would leave Iran with the opportunity to eventually build weapons that could be used against Israel or other foes. While the possible agreement has drawn bipartisan criticism, the letter, signed only by Republicans, underscored the increasingly party-line flavor of the clash. Just last week, the Republican House speaker, John A. Boehner, gave Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel the platform of a joint meeting of Congress to denounce the developing deal, and Senate Republicans briefly tried to advance legislation aimed at forcing Mr. Obama to submit it to Congress, alienating Democratic allies. The letter came as Secretary of State John Kerry’s office announced that he would return to Switzerland on Sunday in hopes of completing the framework agreement before an end-of-March deadline. Under the terms being discussed, Iran would pare back its nuclear program enough so that it would be unable to produce enough fuel for a bomb in less than a year if it tried to break out of the agreement. The pact would last at least 10 years; in exchange the world powers would lift sanctions. The letter warned that any nuclear agreement could be reversed by the next president “with the stroke of a pen.” Whether the Republican letter might undercut Iran’s willingness to strike a deal was not clear. Iran reacted with scorn. “In our view, this letter has no legal value and is mostly a propaganda ploy,” Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iran’s foreign minister, said in a statement. “It is very interesting that while negotiations are still in progress and while no agreement has been reached, some political pressure groups are so afraid even of the prospect of an agreement that they resort to unconventional methods, unprecedented in diplomatic history.” A senior American official said the letter probably would not stop an agreement from being reached, but could make it harder to blame Iran if the talks fail. “The problem is if there is not an agreement, the perception of who is at fault is critically important to our ability to maintain pressure, and this type of thing would likely be used by the Iranians in that scenario,” said the official, who spoke anonymously to discuss the negotiations. The White House and congressional Democrats expressed outrage, calling the letter an unprecedented violation of the tradition of leaving politics at the water’s edge. Republicans said that by styling it as an “open letter,” it was akin to a statement, not an overt intervention in the talks. “It’s somewhat ironic to see some members of Congress wanting to make common cause with the hard-liners in Iran,” Mr. Obama told reporters. “It’s an unusual coalition.” Other Democrats were sharper. Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, called it “just the latest in an ongoing strategy, a partisan strategy, to undermine the president’s ability to conduct foreign policy.” Senator Harry M. Reid of Nevada, the Democratic minority leader, said the “Republicans are undermining our commander in chief while empowering the ayatollahs.” The letter, drafted by Senator Tom Cotton, a freshman from Arkansas, and signed by all but seven members of the Senate Republican majority, warned Iran that a deal with Mr. Obama might not stick. “The next president could revoke such an executive agreement with the stroke of a pen, and future Congresses could modify the terms of the agreement at any time,” said the letter, whose existence was reported earlier by Bloomberg News. What the United States and Iran want out of discussions over Iran’s nuclear development. Mr. Cotton said he drafted the letter because Iran’s leaders might not understand America’s constitutional system. He also said the terms of the emerging deal were dangerous because they would not be permanent and would leave Iran with nuclear infrastructure. He noted that four Republican senators who may run for president signed his letter and added that he tried without success to get Democrats to sign. “The only thing unprecedented is an American president negotiating a nuclear deal with the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism without submitting it to Congress,” he said on CNN. The letter revived an old debate about what role Congress should have in diplomacy. Jim Wright, the Democratic House speaker during Ronald Reagan’s presidency, was accused of interfering when he met with opposing leaders in Nicaragua’s contra war. Three House Democrats went to Iraq in 2002 before President George W. Bush’s invasion to try to head off war. And Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, went to Syria in 2007 to meet with President Bashar al-Assad against the wishes of the Bush administration, which was trying to isolate him. An agreement with Iran would not require immediate congressional action because Mr. Obama has the power to lift sanctions he imposed under his executive authority and to suspend others imposed by Congress. But permanently lifting those imposed by Congress, as Iran has sought, would eventually require a vote. Rather than wait, Republicans, joined by several Democrats, drafted legislation aimed at forcing Mr. Obama to submit the agreement to Congress. But when Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican majority leader, moved to advance that legislation for a vote, Democrats who support it balked at taking action before the talks with Iran concluded. Mr. McConnell backed off, but the bill may be revived if a deal is reached. Among the Republicans who declined to sign Mr. Cotton’s letter was Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, the Foreign Relations Committee chairman, who has been working with Democrats on Iran legislation. “We’ve got a bipartisan effort that’s underway that has a chance of being successful, and while I understand all kinds of people want to weigh in,” he said, he concluded that it would not “be helpful in that effort for me to be involved in it.” Some Democrats, like Representative Brad Sherman of California, said the letter and other moves risked making it a party-line issue, in which case it would be impossible to muster a two-thirds vote to override a presidential veto. “The number of Democrats not willing to follow the president’s lead is reduced when it becomes a personal or political issue,” he said. A previous version of this article misstated the given name of the senator who drafted the letter from American lawmakers to Iranian leaders. He is Tom Cotton, not Tim Cotton.

Obama Urges ‘Creative’ Talks to Bridge Divide With Iran on Sanctions	Advertisement Supported by By  and WASHINGTON — President Obama on Friday directed his diplomats to use “creative negotiations” to bridge a sharp divide with Iran over the fate of sanctions if it agrees to curb its nuclear program, signaling flexibility in hopes of keeping a tentative agreement from unraveling. Iranian leaders have insisted in recent days that the punishing sanctions be lifted as soon as a written accord is signed, a position that the country’s foreign minister reinforced on Friday. Mr. Obama did not repeat past American assertions that sanctions would be removed only in phases as Tehran follows through on obligations to scale back its nuclear facilities. Instead, Mr. Obama suggested that negotiators seek a solution that would seem “more acceptable” to Iran’s political constituencies, while preserving leverage to force the government to abide by the deal. Rather than the timing and structure of sanctions relief, he said his priority was creating a system for reimposing the punitive measures if Iran is caught cheating. “How sanctions are lessened, how we snap back sanctions if there’s a violation, there are a lot of different mechanisms and ways to do that,” Mr. Obama said at a White House news conference alongside the Italian prime minister, Matteo Renzi. The negotiators, Mr. Obama said, need to “find formulas that get to our main concerns while allowing the other side to make a presentation to their body politic that is more acceptable.” “Our main concern here is making sure that if Iran doesn’t abide by its agreement, that we don’t have to jump through a whole bunch of hoops in order to reinstate sanctions,” Mr. Obama continued. “That’s our main concern.” With Secretary of State John Kerry seated in front of him in the East Room, the president said: “And it will require some creative negotiations by John Kerry and others. And I’m confident we will be successful.” The dispute over sanctions has proved to be one of the biggest flash points as each side characterizes a framework agreement that has yet to be committed to writing. American officials long anticipated that Iran would portray the agreement in more favorable terms to its domestic audience, but the insistence on immediate sanctions relief underscored the challenges in translating the current understanding into a final accord by a June 30 deadline. Mr. Obama’s domestic critics have cited that uncertainty as evidence that he and his counterparts from Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China have not struck a good enough bargain. If sanctions are lifted at the start, they argue, Iran will not have an incentive to genuinely cut back its nuclear program. Mohammed Javad Zarif, Iran’s foreign minister, said Friday that the United States had diverged from the framework agreement reached on April 2 by publishing what the Americans called a fact sheet about its basic provisions. Contrary to the American assertion, Mr. Zarif said, there would be no phased removal of sanctions to ensure Iranian compliance. “The United States for their own domestic reasons — and that’s their right and prerogative — produced a fact sheet, which was not exactly what we adopted,” Mr. Zarif told Euronews, a France-based broadcaster. American and Iranian officials are using different words to describe elements of the preliminary agreement to limit Iran’s nuclear program. In his first extensive interview with a Western news organization since the agreement was reached, Mr. Zarif also raised the prospect of unlimited enrichment of Iranian atomic fuel if the talks did not achieve a final agreement by June 30 with all sanctions dropped. While Iranian officials have always asserted that their nuclear program is peaceful — and Mr. Zarif did so again in — he chose blunt language to describe what would happen if negotiations failed to produce a final agreement. “We can have the path of confrontation, or we can have the path of cooperation,” he said, speaking in English. “We cannot have a little bit of each. If we take the path of confrontation, the United States and the United Nations will continue with their sanctions, and Iran will continue with its enrichment program. Without any limitations.” As for Mr. Obama, his aides said he was not trying to signal a change in policy with his comments at the news conference. “He was emphasizing snapback” sanctions that could be reapplied quickly “and the fact that this will be a subject of intense negotiation,” said a senior administration official, who insisted on anonymity to parse the president’s words. “But we’ve always made clear the principle that sanctions relief will have to be phased and in response to Iranian actions, and that continues to be the case.” Negotiators will meet in Vienna next week to resume talks aimed at forging a final deal. Besides the sanctions issue, other areas of dispute include how much leeway international inspectors will have to visit suspected nuclear sites, including those on military bases, and how forthcoming Iran will have to be about any past work to design nuclear weapons. Even as he has focused on concluding a deal with Iran, Mr. Obama has been maneuvering for room at home, where Republicans and many Democrats have been skeptical of his agreement. He said Friday that he would sign bipartisan legislation that would temporarily suspend his power to waive sanctions imposed by Congress while lawmakers review and possibly vote on any agreement. Although he had vowed to veto an earlier version, he said the current draft was “a reasonable compromise” because it would not interfere with the negotiations. But he made clear that he remained bothered by what he initially saw as an intrusion into the president’s authority to conduct foreign policy. “I still have some concerns about the suggestion that that tradition was in some ways changing,” he said. But the revised bill made clear that it was focused on congressionally imposed sanctions. “And that I think at least allows me to interpret the legislation in such a way that it is not sending a signal to future presidents that each and every time they’re negotiating a political agreement, that they have to get a congressional authorization.” He also refrained from criticizing Russia for deciding to resume sales of S-300 antiaircraft batteries to Iran, which it had suspended for years. Such batteries worry military planners who say they could make it much more difficult for the United States or Israel to bomb Iran’s nuclear facilities if the agreement breaks down. Mr. Obama said he was “frankly surprised” that Russia had held back selling the weapons this long, but added that the decision buttressed his argument in favor of a deal because it showed that international solidarity could crumble. “If it is perceived that we walked away from a fair deal that gives us assurances Iran doesn’t get a nuclear weapon, then those international sanctions will fray,” he said. “And it won’t just be Russia or China. It will be some of our close allies.” Peter Baker reported from Washington, and Rick Gladstone from New York. video Advertisement
President Obama Calls Preliminary Iran Nuclear Deal ‘Our Best Bet’	Advertisement Supported by By  WASHINGTON — strongly defended last week’s with as a “once in a lifetime opportunity” to curb the spread of in a dangerous region while reassuring critics that he would keep all options available if Tehran ultimately cheated. As he sought in an interview with The New York Times to sell the tentative deal to skeptics accusing him of giving away too much, Mr. Obama emphasized to that “we’ve got their backs” in the face of Iranian hostility. And he suggested that he could accept some sort of vote in Congress if it did not block his ability to carry out the agreement. “This is our best bet by far to make sure Iran doesn’t get a nuclear weapon,” Mr. Obama said in an , an Op-Ed columnist for The Times, published on Sunday. “What we will be doing even as we enter into this deal is sending a very clear message to the Iranians and to the entire region that if anybody messes with Israel, America will be there.” In the interview, held Saturday, Mr. Obama provided new details about how international inspectors would try to access suspected covert nuclear sites and about the sequence that would lead to sanctions being lifted. Both were major issues in the last days of negotiations in Switzerland, and Mr. Obama’s descriptions differed in key respects from Iran’s interpretations. That gap suggested the hardest moments in the negotiations may yet be ahead, given that commitments made last week must still be enshrined in a written document signed by all parties by June 30. But Mr. Obama seemed to gain breathing space as Republicans signaled they would give him until then to see what the final deal looks like before directly intervening. The president’s comments came as the White House embarked on a campaign to a preliminary agreement that he hopes will transform security in the Middle East. Under the framework, negotiated with the United States and five other world powers, Iran agreed to scale back its significantly for 10 to 15 years and accept intense international inspections. In exchange, the United States and the international community would lift sanctions that have punished the Iranian economy. While in theory preventing Iran from being able to quickly build a bomb, the agreement leaves it with a nuclear program in place, even if much diminished, drawing criticism from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and Republican leaders in Congress as well as skepticism from Arab allies and many Democrats. “Not a single centrifuge is destroyed,” Mr. Netanyahu said Sunday on “State of the Union” on CNN. “Not a single nuclear facility is shut down, including the underground facilities that they build illicitly. Thousands of centrifuges will keep spinning, enriching uranium. That’s a very bad deal.” Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a possible Republican presidential candidate, said it was “probably the best deal that Barack Obama could get with the Iranians because the Iranians don’t fear” him. “Hillary Clinton could do better,” he added, as could all the Republican candidates, “except maybe Rand Paul.” But Mr. Graham said he would wait to see how the final agreement looked. “I don’t mind giving the administration the time between now and June to put this deal together,” he said on “Face the Nation” on CBS. In the interview, the president struck a conciliatory note after weeks of with Mr. Netanyahu, a clash that has worried even some White House advisers. Mr. Obama said “I respect” Mr. Netanyahu’s security argument and agreed that Israelis “have every right to be concerned about Iran,” a country that has threatened “to destroy Israel, that has denied the Holocaust, that has expressed venomous anti-Semitic ideas.” Whether Iran is racing toward nuclear weapon capabilities is one of the most contentious foreign-policy issues challenging the West. He pledged to redouble support for Israeli security. “I would consider it a failure on my part, a fundamental failure of my presidency, if on my watch, or as a consequence of work that I had done, Israel was rendered more vulnerable,” he said. Similarly, he said he wanted to use a meeting he has called at Camp David to “formalize” security aid for Arab allies threatened by Iran. While still resisting what he deemed congressional interference, Mr. Obama reached out to Republicans, calling Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, a “good and decent man.” He did not embrace Mr. Corker’s legislation to give Congress the right to approve or reject the deal. But when asked about a nonbinding vote, the president appeared supportive. “My hope is that we can find something that allows Congress to express itself but does not encroach on traditional presidential prerogatives and ensures that if in fact we get a good deal that we can go ahead and implement it,” Mr. Obama said. Mr. Corker, appearing on “Fox News Sunday,” immediately rejected the idea of a nonbinding vote. “There is strong bipartisan support for a binding vote by Congress,” he said. “Look, the president needs to sell this to the American people, and Congress needs to be involved in this way.” Under the agreement, Iran would limit enrichment of uranium at its Natanz facility to a level useful only for civilian purposes; cut back the number of installed centrifuges by approximately two-thirds; convert its Fordo deep-underground enrichment facility into a research center; and modify its Arak heavy-water reactor to render it incapable of producing plutonium for a bomb. But the structure of international inspections was left vague, as was the timing for lifting sanctions. Mr. Obama said that inspectors would be able to watch “the entire nuclear chain” and that a “procurement committee” would examine Iranian imports to be sure equipment would be appropriate for peaceful nuclear uses, not a weapon. Inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency, he said, “can go anyplace.” But the administration has been vague about how to define “anyplace,” and Iran has said it would not be required to allow inspections of military bases. “Iran could object,” Mr. Obama acknowledged, “but what we have done is to try to design a mechanism whereby once those objections are heard, that is not a final veto that Iran has but in fact some sort of international mechanism will be in place that makes a fair assessment.” Mr. Obama said sanctions would be lifted only after Iran lived up to its commitments. “There are still details to be worked out,” he said, “but I think that the basic framework calls for Iran to take the steps that it needs to around Fordo, the centrifuges and so forth. At that point, then the U.N. sanctions are suspended.” A guide to help you navigate the deal between global powers and Tehran. He said the United States would “preserve the ability to snap back those sanctions if there is a violation.” And he added that separate sanctions imposed for other reasons, namely Iran’s sponsorship of terrorists and its ballistic missile program, would remain in place. Administration officials said they envisioned Iran being able to take the required steps within months or a year of an agreement, at which point nuclear-related economic sanctions would be removed. But a major sticking point in the coming months will be the issue of additional sanctions imposed for other reasons. Mr. Obama said almost nothing about how the United States and its allies would force Iran to answer questions about suspected past work on weapons designs. For years, Iran has blocked inspectors from visiting laboratories where such work is believed to have been conducted. Mr. Obama presented the nuclear agreement in broader terms. He admitted that he remained uncertain about the intentions of the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, with whom he has exchanged letters. “He’s a pretty tough read,” Mr. Obama said. The ayatollah’s letters, he said, are filled with “a lot of reminders of what he perceives as past grievances against Iran.” But Mr. Obama said it was telling that the ayatollah allowed his negotiators to make concessions, and he held out hope that the agreement would empower more moderate figures, although he said he was not counting on it. “Who knows?” he added. “Iran may change.” But if not, he said, the United States retains “the most firepower” to address any contingencies. “It’s not as if in all these conversations, I’m leaving all my, you know, rifles at the door,” he said. Asked about an Obama Doctrine, he said: “The doctrine is we will engage, but we preserve all our capabilities. And I’ve been very clear that Iran will not get a nuclear weapon on my watch, and I think they should understand that we mean it. But I say that hoping that we can conclude this diplomatic arrangement and that it ushers in a new era in U.S.-Iranian relations.” David E. Sanger contributed reporting. Opinion video Advertisement
Iranians Celebrate Agreement Online and in the Streets	Advertisement Supported by By  As my colleague from Iran’s capital, Tehran, Iranians greeted news of that could bring an end to international sanctions and isolation warily at first, and then somewhat more loudly. Within hours of the deal’s being announced on Twitter by Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, journalists and bloggers were sharing glimpses of public and private joy, with video and images of honking car horns and dancing in the streets spreading online. Found solutions. Ready to start drafting immediately. Iranians texting and tweeting Congrats to each other, quoting famous song "Winter is over." A national sigh of relief!  Supporters of the agreement rallied outside the foreign ministry, singing in honor of the negotiators, and waved flags and victory signs on the streets of the capital. Mr. Zarif celebrated on a plane back to Tehran with Iranian journalists who had covered the talks in Lausanne, Switzerland, in a scene captured on video and uploaded to Instagram by Ali Araghchi, a nephew of Iran’s deputy foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi. Early Friday, Mr. Zarif was given at Mehrabad Airport in Tehran . As Trita Parsi, the president of the National Iranian American Council, noted, in of the minister’s motorcade leaving the airport, the crowd could be heard chanting “condolences” to enemies of the deal — including both Israel and the hardliners at the Tehran daily Keyhan — and , the Iranian prime minister deposed in in 1953.

How to Talk to Iran	Advertisement Supported by Op-Ed Contributors By  and IF there are any two words in Persian that President Obama should learn, they are “maslahat” and “aberu.” Maslahat is often translated as expediency, or self-interest. Aberu means face — as in, saving face. In the nearly 34 years since the Islamic revolution in Iran, expediency has been a pillar of decision making, but within a framework that has allowed Iranian leaders to save face. If there is to be any resolution of the nuclear standoff, Western leaders must grasp these concepts. Two examples illustrate this point. In 1988, after eight years of devastating war with Saddam Hussein’s Iraq, Iran’s first supreme leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, accepted a United Nations-brokered cease-fire agreement, deeming it to be in Iran’s maslahat. It was crucial that Iraqi forces had been pushed off Iranian soil, so Tehran could claim a victory. Thirteen years later, after the 9/11 attacks, the United States overthrew the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, which had sheltered Al Qaeda, in a matter of weeks. American troops would never have made it to Kabul and Mazar-i-Sharif with such speed had Iran’s leaders not acquiesced to the toppling of their enemies to the east. But the George W. Bush administration squandered an opportunity for dialogue by spurning this potential diplomatic overture by Iran. For thousands of years, Persian culture has been distinguished by customs that revolve around honor and esteem. Preserving one’s aberu is tantamount to maintaining one’s dignity. There are almost no instances in modern Iranian history when maslahat has trumped aberu. The West has poorly understood these concepts. This was particularly true under President Bush, who rewarded Iran’s tacit acceptance of the American invasion of Afghanistan by labeling Iran a member of an “axis of evil.” Following the 2003 allied invasion of Iraq, the Swiss ambassador to Iran to Washington with an unofficial outline for a “grand bargain” with Tehran that would cover everything from Iran’s nuclear program to its support for militant groups in the region. Despite this bold step, Iran was left out in the cold. Vice President Dick Cheney , reportedly asserting that “we don’t talk to evil.” We now know, thanks to a recent memoir by the former Iranian nuclear negotiator Hassan Rowhani, that the Bush administration reached out to Tehran a year after dismissing the proposal. Not surprisingly, partly because of the blow to its pride, the Iranian government rejected the offer of direct, high-level talks as insincere. In the nine years since, Iran’s nuclear program — a major symbol of prestige for Iranians — has grown immensely. Things have gotten a lot more complicated. The pattern of missed opportunities has persisted for more than three decades now. The result is that Barack Obama is the sixth consecutive president who has been led to view Iran as a threat rather than an opportunity. It is time for America to exit this vicious cycle and disregard irrational voices intent on sabotaging efforts to reach an understanding. When Mr. Obama took office in 2009, he promised a real dialogue with Iran. Many in Tehran are still waiting for him to deliver on that promise. But how? The foundation of post-1979 decision making in Iran is the pursuit of sovereignty within a framework that balances maslahat and aberu. We believe Iran would be open to new measures regarding the transparency of its nuclear program, and would agree not to pursue any capability to enrich uranium beyond that needed to fuel atomic power plants, if its legitimate right to enrichment under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty was recognized and if an agreement to remove sanctions was reached. Equally important is how a deal would be implemented. Decades of mutual, institutionalized hostility have created a gulf of mistrust that neither side can unilaterally bridge. So getting the sequence right would be crucial to any accord. While Tehran views a deal on its nuclear program as being in its self-interest, Western leaders need to grasp that it would be devastating for Iran’s aberu to take the first step solely in exchange for promises. The dominant discourse in Tehran portrays the 2004 decision by the former Iranian president Mohammad Khatami to suspend uranium enrichment on a voluntary, temporary basis as a failure because it resulted only in humiliating calls by the West for an indefinite suspension. The moral of this narrative is that placing maslahat above aberu, even temporarily, leads to nothing good. In the coming months, Iran is expected to again engage with the so-called P5+1 (the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France, along with Germany). Mr. Obama and his team, including his chief Iran negotiator, Under Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, should reflect on the meaning of maslahat and aberu. Understanding the Iranian mentality is key to grasping why the Iranians won’t put expediency above dignity. The only way to stop the dispute over Iran’s nuclear program from spinning out of control is to offer the Islamic Republic a face-saving way out.

None	Advertisement  ISTANBUL — Talks between and six world powers made little progress on Friday, with a late-night plenary session becoming tense and even acrimonious before an agreement to meet again on Saturday, senior Western diplomats said. Iran has refused so far to engage on specifics and continues to assert that it is in full compliance with nuclear agency inspectors, while insisting on its right to enrich uranium no matter what the demands. “The Iranians still will not admit that they have a problem with the world,” one diplomat said late Friday night. “Every idea we put forward they find a reason not to take it up.” He said that the talks came very close to ending Friday night, but the parties agreed in the end to continue them on Saturday morning. But it was unlikely that a date would be set here for a further round of talks, another Western diplomat said after the last, unscheduled plenary session, which lasted 2 hours and 30 minutes and broke up just before midnight. “I think it will be an agreement to go away and reflect” on the usefulness of these talks, said the diplomat, who, like others here, spoke under normal ground rules of anonymity. Advertisement The six powers — the United States and the other four members of the United Nations Security Council, plus Germany — had asked for the extra  session  in order to shape a framework for further talks and confidence-building measures, the diplomats said. They emphasized that the six would not agree to any preconditions. Advertisement After a two-hour opening plenary session on Friday morning largely given over to summarizing known positions, the talks broke at about noon for Friday prayers and lunch, and did not resume again until 4 p.m. Then, a bilateral meeting between the Iranian chief negotiator, Saeed Jalili, and the representative of the world powers, Catherine Ashton, the European Union foreign policy chief, convened for 90 minutes. But Western diplomats expressed disappointment with the results of the meeting. They said that Ms. Ashton laid out an agreed position on how to move forward, with a revised fuel swap deal for Iran’s already enriched uranium and a series of bilateral meetings, including one with the United States. But Mr. Jalili said that first there must be recognition of Iran’s right to enrich uranium and a lifting of "measures” — understood as sanctions — that would  “would jeopardize Iran’s rights and obligations” under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The diplomats said that Iran’s right to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes was a given, and that the sanctions had been imposed by the United Nations Security Council after Iran failed to deal honestly and completely with the . They said they wanted to move into detailed discussions with Iran of a modified fuel swap deal, first laid out in October 2009, designed to remove enough enriched uranium to prevent Iran from building a bomb in return for fuel rods for a small Tehran reactor making medical isotopes. The point of this Istanbul meeting has been “to find out if Iran is serious” about negotiating, a senior Western diplomat said. There is still no clear answer to that question, but American and French officials in particular have said in the last few days that “talking cannot be an endless process,” even as they have expressed relief that Iran is having difficulties with its centrifuges and the estimated time for it to be nuclear-bomb capable has been extended.

While Mr. Jalili has had other bilateral meetings with the Russians and the Turks, who are supposed to be simply hosting the talks, he has not yet taken up an open invitation for a separate meeting with the United States delegation and its leader, William J. Burns, the under secretary of state for political affairs. The last formal bilateral meeting between the two was in October 2009. In the bilateral with Mr. Jalili, Ms. Ashton “put forward where we would like to go in the process in a positive fashion,” a Western diplomat said. "We want to push it forward on the basis of no preconditions.” But so far, he said, there has been no discussion of the details of any modified fuel swap or any agreement on a framework for further negotiations. He called the results of the meeting "inconclusive.” The goal of the six is to get Iran to suspend enrichment entirely, at least for the period of serious negotiations; all these talks are trying to do is to create enough mutual trust to shape a process, including confidence-building measures like the fuel swap, to enable more serious talks to take place on an agreed agenda. The six are also offering a set of economic and technical aid programs if Iran agrees to stop enrichment. Iran insists its nuclear program is only for civilian energy; most of the rest of the world believes that the program is military. Advertisement Tehran is under four sets of Security Council sanctions for refusing to cease enrichment and other activities that could be used to make , and has regularly kept its enrichment activities secret from the International Atomic Energy Agency, which says it still has serious questions Iran will not answer. But Iran came to the table warning that it would never stop enrichment. "Resolutions, sanctions, threats, computer virus nor even a military attack will stop uranium enrichment in Iran," Ali Asghar Soltanieh, Iran’s ambassador to the nuclear agency, told Iranian state television. Iran has regularly wanted to discuss a larger agenda at these talks, including global nuclear disarmament, Israel, and the American military presence in Iraq and Afghanistan. The talks in Istanbul are scheduled to continue on Saturday. They are the second round of talks between Iran and the six after negotiations resumed last month in Geneva, breaking a 14-month hiatus.

With U.S. Eyes on Iran, North Korea’s Nuclear Arsenal Expanded	Advertisement Supported by News Analysis By  SEOUL, South Korea — While the Obama administration spent the past two years getting within striking distance of a deal to delay Iran’s race for a nuclear bomb, North Korea went on an atomic spending spree: an expansion officials here fear Washington has little hope of stopping. Satellite photographs of the North’s main nuclear facility at Yongbyon, released in 2013, have shown of the nuclear enrichment plant there, which the United States did not know about until 2010, and American officials strongly suspect there is a second one. A consensus is emerging that the North most likely possesses a dozen or so and could be on the way to an arsenal of as many as 20 by the end of 2016. “In my view, 20 is a hell of a lot of bombs,” Siegfried S. Hecker, a former director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory and a professor at Stanford, said in an interview. But Mr. Hecker, who was the first American and has made some of the best unclassified estimates of its future capabilities, said he was doubtful of recent claims by American military officials that the North was on the verge of shrinking a nuclear weapon to fit on a long-range missile capable of hitting the western United States. The apparent buildup in nuclear bombs, after 20 years of failed efforts by the United States to keep North Korea from reaching this point, has become a rallying call for both sides debating the agreement with Iran. Republicans and Israeli officials, led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, cite the trail of broken agreements with the North as a warning of what they say will become of the Iran deal. President Obama’s allies turn that argument on its head: The lesson, they say, is that an enforceable, verifiable deal is the only way to keep Iran from doing in the next decade what North Korea has done in the past few years. Both sides are, of course, selectively plucking arguments to support their case. The reality is that the Iranian and North Korean programs, while often referred to in the same breath by politicians, are so different that all the analogies are flawed. For starters, no agreement with North Korea was ever as specific as the , which Congress is moving to review after a bill on Thursday. The Agreed Framework between the United States and North Korea in 1994 was a few pages long, compared with the hundreds of pages and annexes in the Iran deal. In addition, Iran says it will abide by the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which provides a legal underpinning for the final deal that is supposed to be sealed by June 30. In contrast, North Korea boasts that its atomic arsenal is enshrined in its Constitution, and it withdrew from the treaty long ago. (The club of nuclear nations that have not signed the treaty is a small one: India, Israel and Pakistan. All are believed to have 100 to 200 weapons, and many suspect that range is the ultimate goal of North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un.) Inspectors have regular access to Iran’s major nuclear sites, although they have been stonewalled on some details of alleged work on past weapons designs. The deal includes provisions for monitoring equipment in every known facility and requirements that Iran dilute its stockpiles of weapons-grade fuel or ship them out of the country. In contrast, there have been no inspectors in North Korea for years. Not least, Iran’s leadership is under domestic political pressure to end sanctions and normalize relations with the West, but North Korea sees near-total isolation as the key to its survival. American strategy has also gone in opposite directions. Mr. Obama made overtures to North Korea during his first months in office, but his view quickly changed when the country responded by conducting a nuclear test. He and his advisers decided that Iran was the far better strategic bet: With luck, it could be stopped from building weapons. North Korea’s arsenal, one of Mr. Obama’s top Asia aides said, “is already in the rearview mirror.” The administration began discussing “strategic patience,” which essentially meant continuing pressure through sanctions and other levers until North Korea decided to negotiate. But the North says the prospect of disarmament is long past. It wants what amounts to arms control negotiations that acknowledge it as a nuclear power — which the Obama administration, like the Bush administration, says it will never accept. Behind the scenes, Sydney A. Seiler, the State Department’s coordinator for eliminating North Korea’s nuclear program, and his counterparts from China, Japan, Russia and South Korea have been putting together a package of proposals to show to the North that would find a basis for resuming negotiations. Several officials involved described a package that sounds, in broad strokes, a lot like the secret diplomacy that preceded the negotiations with Iran: a freeze on all current production so that the North’s arsenal would not be expanding as negotiations resumed. But in interviews in Seoul, senior South Korean officials said they were concerned that the events of the past two years, while the United States was focused on Iran, had left them with a far more complex situation. “Some in my government feel that we may now face the point of no return on the North’s nuclear technology and their missile capability,” one official said. “The point of no return” is a phrase the Israelis used to use about Iran, fearing that its program was too large to ever contain. The concern about the North’s nuclear expansion is not that it would launch a pre-emptive strike on South Korea or Japan, because North Korean officials know their government would be decimated in minutes or hours. But South Korean and American strategists are worried that a stockpile of 20 weapons, and perhaps 50 or more by 2020, could give the country enough extra supply to sell highly enriched uranium, much as it has sold missile and other technology to Iran, Pakistan and Syria. “It would be an enormously risky thing for them to do,” one senior American military official here said. “But we’ve seen them take other very risky actions in the past,” including building a reactor in Syria, which Israel in an airstrike in 2007. Apart from the destruction of the reactor itself, the North suffered little for that action, and the in January in retaliation for the cyberattack on Sony Pictures, for which North Korea was responsible, have been viewed as largely ineffective. Some American officials say they have one last hope: If the deal with Iran works and sanctions are lifted, North Korean officials, who are following the negotiations closely, might conclude that their nuclear program could be traded for economic integration. Other senior American officials say that is a pipe dream. “For Iran, some degree of integration is part of how you build national power,” one of those officials said. But for North Korea, he added, “it’s the pathway to disintegration.” Advertisement
