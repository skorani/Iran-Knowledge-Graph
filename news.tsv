"Is John Bolton the most dangerous man in the world?","The US is closer to war with Iran than it has been since the Bush years, or perhaps ever. And Bolton is largely to blame  Thu 16 May 2019 07.00 BST   Last modified on Fri 17 May 2019 19.43 BST   Donald Trump’s national security adviser John Bolton wants the United States to go to war with Iran . We know this because he has been saying it for nearly  two  decades . And everything that the Trump administration has done over its Iran policy, particularly since Bolton became Trump’s top foreign policy adviser in April of 2018, must be viewed through this lens, including the alarming US military posturing in the Middle East of the past two weeks. Just after one month on the job, Bolton gave Trump the final push he needed to withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement, which at the time was (and still is, for now) successfully boxing in Iran’s nuclear program and blocking all pathways for Iran to build a bomb. The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) – as the Iran deal is formally known – was the biggest obstacle to Bolton’s drive for a regime change war, because it eliminated a helpful pretext that served so useful to sell the war in Iraq 17 years ago. Since walking away from the deal, the Trump administration has claimed that with a “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran, it can achieve a “better deal” that magically turns Iran into a Jeffersonian democracy bowing to every and any American wish. But this has always been a fantastically bad-faith argument meant to obscure the actual goal (regime change) and provide cover for the incremental steps – the crushing sanctions, bellicose rhetoric, and antagonizing military maneuvers – that have now put the United States closer to war with Iran than it has been since at least the latter half of the Bush administration, or perhaps ever. And Bolton has no qualms about manipulating or outright ignoring intelligence to advance his agenda, which is exactly what’s happening right now. In his White House statement 10 days ago announcing (an already pre-planned) carrier and bomber deployment to the Middle East, Bolton cited “a number of troubling and escalatory indications and warnings” from Iran to justify the bolstered US military presence. But multiple sources who have seen the same intelligence have since said that Bolton and the Trump administration blew it “out of proportion, characterizing the threat as more significant than it actually was”. Even a British general operating in the region pushed back this week, saying he has seen no evidence of an increased Iranian threat. What’s even more worrying is that Bolton knows what he’s doing. He’s “a seasoned bureaucratic infighter who has the skills to press forcefully for his views” – and he has a long history of using those skills to undermine American diplomacy and work toward killing arms control agreements. As a senior official in the George W Bush administration, he played key role in the collapse of the Agreed Framework, the Clinton-era deal that froze North Korea’s plutonium nuclear program (the North Koreans tested their first bomb four years later). He said he “felt like a kid on Christmas day” after he orchestrated the US withdrawal from the international criminal court in 2002. And now as a senior official in the Trump administration, he pushed for the US to withdrawal from a crucial nuclear arms treaty with Russia. While it’s unclear how much of a role he played in scuttling Trump’s negotiations with Kim Jong-un in Hanoi last year, he publicly called for the so-called “Libya model” with the North Koreans (in other words, regime change by force). Just months before joining the administration, he tried to make the legal case for a preventive war against Pyongyang. And if you think he cares about the aftermath of war with North Korea, he doesn’t. Bolton was reportedly “unmoved” by a presentation during his time in the Bush administration of the catastrophic consequences of such a war. “I don’t do war. I do policy,” he said then. So far, Bolton has been successful in moving the United States toward his desired outcome with Iran – if getting the Pentagon to draw up plans to send 120,000 US troops to the region to confront Iran is any indication. There are hopeful signs that we can avoid war, as US officials and our European allies, seemingly alarmed by what Bolton is up to, are sounding the alarm about the Trump administration skewing intelligence on Iran. But Bolton is on a fast track, seemingly aware that Trump’s time in office may be limited. The question, ultimately, is whether the president can stick to his instincts of avoiding more military conflict, or acquiesce to a man hellbent on boxing him into a corner with no way out other than war with Iran.

"Mike Pompeo urges UK to help rein in 'lawless' Iran over nuclear deal","UK told ‘not to soothe the ayatollahs angry’ at US decision to abandon nuclear deal  Patrick Wintour and  Julian Borger  Wed 8 May 2019 20.03 BST   Last modified on Thu 9 May 2019 00.25 BST   US secretary of state Mike Pompeo has urged the UK to stand with Washington in reining in Iran’s “bloodletting and lawlessness”, as Tehran took the first conditional steps to extricate itself from the landmark nuclear deal it had signed with the west, Russia and China in 2015. Iran said it was acting in response to Donald Trump’s decision a year ago to withdraw the US from the deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, JCPOA, imposing a wave of sanctions not just on Iran but on any company that seeks to trade with it. While Pompeo was in Britain, Trump announced a new layer of sanctions, this time targeting Iranian metal industries. The foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt , said Iran’s decision on Wednesday was unwelcome. “They need to be very clear that if they do not comply with the JCPOA, there will be consequences,” he said. “This is a very big moment for Iran. Their economy is a state of severe distress. The last thing they they should be doing is investing money in re-nuclearising. It will make them less secure, not more secure.” But Hunt’s aides said Tehran’s move did not itself represent a breach of the agreement, nor warrant sanctions. Senior British diplomats are due to travel to Tehran this weekend to urge restraint. Pompeo described the announcements made by the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, as “intentionally ambiguous” and designed to make the world jump – and probably aimed at reducing the “breakout time” by which Iran could secure a nuclear bomb. Speaking in London, Pompeo minimised differences between the US and the UK over Iran. “There is no daylight between our two countries on the threat emanating from the Iranian regime,” he said. “We agree they are operating in defiance of UN ballistic missiles resolution. We agree they fund terror across the Middle East and across the world. We agree they take hostages and repress their own people.” But Pompeo added: “I urge the UK to stand with us to rein in bloodletting and lawlessness, not to soothe the ayatollahs angry at our decision to pull out of a nuclear deal.” He implied that if the UK’s true motive in cooperating with Iran was access to new markets, the US and UK could cooperate to find alternatives. Iran’s phased departure from the deal centres on a threat to enrich its uranium stockpile closer to weapons-grade levels in 60 days’ time if European powers fail to deliver on previous trade promises. The announcement came against a background of military escalation in the Middle East. The US dispatched an aircraft carrier and bombers to the region earlier this week, claiming it had intelligence of a “credible threat” from Iranian forces. The US stepped up its pressure on an already reeling Iranian economy. Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday sanctioning the country’s iron, steel, aluminium and copper industries. “We are successfully imposing the most powerful maximum pressure campaign ever witnessed, which today’s action will further strengthen,” Trump said in a written statement. The president held out the prospects of new negotiations, but in the framework of 12 wide-ranging conditions the US has laid down for Iran. “I look forward to someday meeting with the leaders of Iran in order to work out an agreement and, very importantly, taking steps to give Iran the future it deserves,” Trump said. The US has also blocked the sale of Iranian oil on the global market, depriving Tehran of 40 % of its annual revenue. The value of the Iranian rial has collapsed, fuelling unemployment and inflation. Meanwhile, the Rouhani government has come under political pressure from hardliners who have long maintained that Iran gave up too much in the nuclear deal. Rouhani said in a televised address: “We felt that the nuclear deal needs a surgery, and the painkiller pills of the last year have been ineffective. This surgery is for saving the deal, not destroying it.” The first step, Rouhani said, was to end the sale of excess uranium and heavy water, a move that will increase Iran’s stocks of both above levels stipulated in the deal. The move was partially forced on Iran by the US decision last week to end waivers allowing Iran to exchange its enriched uranium for unrefined yellowcake uranium from Russia, and to sell its heavy water – used as a coolant in nuclear reactors – to Oman. If no new deal is in place within 60 days, Iran will increase its enrichment of uranium beyond the 3.67% permitted in the accord, which can fuel a commercial nuclear power plant. Rouhani did not identify the level to which Iran would be willing to enrich, although the head of Iran’s nuclear program again reiterated that it could reach 20% enrichment within four days. Scientists have said that once a country enriches uranium to about 20%, the time needed to reach the 90% threshold for weapons-grade uranium is halved. Rouhani also said that if the 60 days pass without action, Iran will halt a Chinese-led effort to redesign its Arak heavy water nuclear reactor. Such reactors produce plutonium that can be used in nuclear weapons. Iran notified Britain, Russia, China, the European Union, France and Germany of its decisions earlier on Wednesday. Iran said it will not need to take the steps if countries “join negotiations and help Iran to reach its benefits in the fields of oil and banking”. It is not clear if Europe has either the means or the will to engineer a mechanism that truly protects European traders dealing with Iranian banks from the threat of US sanctions. Pompeo said it would be legitimate for Europe to trade humanitarian supplies with Iran since they are exempt from sanctions, but they remained the only items exempt from US treasury oversight. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, a fierce opponent of Iran and the nuclear deal, said: “I heard that Iran intends to continue its nuclear program. We will not allow Iran to obtain nuclear weapons. “We will continue to fight those who seek to take our lives, and we will thrust our roots even deeper into the soil of our homeland.”"
"Trump Abandons Iran Nuclear Deal He Long Scorned","Advertisement Supported by By  Mark Landler WASHINGTON — President Trump declared on Tuesday that he was withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal, unraveling the signature foreign policy achievement of his predecessor Barack Obama, isolating the United States from its Western allies and sowing uncertainty before a risky nuclear negotiation with North Korea. The decision, while long anticipated and widely telegraphed, leaves the 2015 agreement reached by seven countries after more than two years of grueling negotiations in tatters. The United States will now reimpose the stringent sanctions it imposed on Iran before the deal and is considering new penalties. Iran said it will remain in the deal, which tightly restricted its nuclear ambitions for a decade or more in return for ending the sanctions that had crippled its economy. So did France, Germany and Britain, raising the prospect of a trans-Atlantic clash as European companies face the return of American sanctions for doing business with Iran. China and Russia, also signatories to the deal, are likely to join Iran in accusing the United States of violating the accord. Mr. Trump’s move could embolden hard-line forces in Iran, raising the threat of Iranian retaliation against Israel or the United States, fueling an arms race in the Middle East and fanning sectarian conflicts from Syria to Yemen. The president, however, framed his decision as the fulfillment of a bedrock campaign promise and as the act of a dealmaker dissolving a fatally flawed agreement. He predicted his tough line with Iran would strengthen his hand as he prepared to meet North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, to begin negotiating the surrender of his nuclear arsenal. “This was a horrible one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made,” a grim-faced Mr. Trump said in an 11-minute address from the Diplomatic Reception Room of the White House. “It didn’t bring calm, it didn’t bring peace, and it never will.” Mr. Trump’s announcement drew a chorus of opposition from European leaders, several of whom lobbied him feverishly not to pull out of the agreement and searched for fixes to it that would satisfy him. It also drew a rare public rebuke by Mr. Obama, who said Mr. Trump’s withdrawal would leave the world less safe, confronting it with “a losing choice between a nuclear-armed Iran or another war in the Middle East.” The response from Iran itself, however, was muted. President Hassan Rouhani declared that the Iranians intended to abide by the terms of the deal, and he criticized Mr. Trump for his history of not honoring international treaties. Mr. Trump won strong backing from Saudi Arabia and Israel, whose leader, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, hailed him for a “historic move” and “courageous leadership.” The restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program under the deal could survive. Three times previously, the president’s aides had persuaded him not to dismantle the Iran deal. But Mr. Trump made clear that his patience had worn thin, and with a new, more hawkish cohort of advisers — led by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the national security adviser, John R. Bolton — the president faced less internal resistance than earlier in his administration. While Mr. Trump had long scorned the Iran deal, threatening repeatedly to rip it up during the 2016 presidential race, his impulse to act now was reinforced by what he views as the success of his policy toward North Korea. He has told aides and foreign leaders that his policy of maximum pressure had forced Mr. Kim to the bargaining table, and that a similar policy of overwhelming pressure would enable the United States to extract a better deal from Iran. As Mr. Trump abandoned one diplomatic project, he accelerated another — announcing that Mr. Pompeo was flying to Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea, to continue discussions with Mr. Kim about the upcoming summit meeting. He expressed hope that three Americans who are detained in the North would be released soon. “The message to North Korea,” Mr. Bolton told reporters, “is the president wants a real deal.” He rejected the suggestion that the United States could not be trusted to keep its agreements when political winds change. “Any nation reserves the right to correct a past mistake,” Mr. Bolton said, citing President George W. Bush’s decision to withdraw from the Antiballistic Missile Treaty in 2001. The Trump administration, he said, would continue to work with Europeans to pressure the Iranians. He dismissed those who said the United States was on a path to war with Iran, though he did not present any new diplomatic initiatives. Another senior administration official acknowledged that there was no Plan B. Months of intense negotiations with the Europeans to keep the accord in place collapsed over Mr. Trump’s insistence that the limits placed by the agreement on Iran’s nuclear fuel production were inadequate. Under the provisions of the deal, those limits, or “sunset clauses,” were to expire in 2030 — 15 years after the deal was signed. As a result, the United States will reinstate all the sanctions it had waived as part of the nuclear accord, and it will impose additional economic penalties that are now being drawn up by the Treasury Department. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin declined on Tuesday to specify what additional sanctions the United States might impose, but he expressed confidence that they would still be powerful even if other American allies did not follow suit. “We do not want to let Iran use the U.S. financial markets and financial system and transact in dollars until they agree that not only will they not have a nuclear weapon now, but we’ve put in provisions that they will never have one,” Mr. Mnuchin said. In his announcement, Mr. Trump recited familiar arguments against the deal: that it does not address the threat of Iran’s ballistic missiles or its malign behavior in the region, and that the expiration dates for the sunset clauses open the door to an Iranian nuclear bomb down the road. Even if Iran was in compliance, he said, it could “still be on the verge of a nuclear breakout in just a short period of time.” In fact, under the deal, the limits on Iran’s uranium enrichment and stockpiles of nuclear fuel mean that Iran would not be on the verge of a nuclear breakout until 2030. Still, Mr. Trump said, the United States and its allies could not stop Iran from building a nuclear weapon “under the decaying and rotten structure of the current agreement.” “The Iran deal is defective at its core,” he concluded. Mr. Trump’s announcement capped a frantic four-day period in which American and European diplomats made a last-ditch effort to bridge their differences and preserve the agreement. That effort began Friday, when Mr. Pompeo called his counterparts in Europe to tell them that Mr. Trump was planning to withdraw from the deal, but that he was trying to win a two-week reprieve for the United States and Europe to continue negotiating. Mr. Pompeo, people familiar with the talks said, suggested that he favored a so-called soft withdrawal, in which Mr. Trump would pull out of the deal but hold off on reimposing some of the sanctions. The next day, the State Department’s chief negotiator, Brian H. Hook, consulted with European diplomats to try to break a deadlock over the sunset provision, under which the restrictions on Iran’s ability to produce nuclear fuel for civilian use expire after 15 years. The Europeans had already agreed to a significant compromise: to reimpose sanctions if there were a determination that the Iranians were within 12 months of producing a nuclear weapon. But officials said that still did not satisfy Mr. Trump, and the Europeans were not willing to go any further. By Monday, the White House began informing allies that Mr. Trump was going to withdraw from the deal and reimpose sanctions on oil and impose new sanctions against the Central Bank of Iran. Under the financial sanctions, European companies will have 90 to 180 days to wind down their operations in Iran, or they will run afoul of the American banking system. The sanctions on oil will require European and Asian countries to reduce their imports from Iran. Mr. Mnuchin insisted that the restrictions would not drive up oil prices because other suppliers would pick up the slack. “My expectation is not that oil prices go higher,” he said. “To a certain extent, some of this was already in the market on oil prices.” Mr. Trump’s decision will test his already frayed relationship with European leaders. President Emmanuel Macron of France, whom the president welcomed with a state dinner two weeks ago, learned of his decision in a phone call with Mr. Trump on Tuesday morning. Later, he said in a post on Twitter that the European allies “regret” his decision. “The international regime against nuclear proliferation is at stake,” he added. In a joint statement, Mr. Macron, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain noted pointedly that the United Nations Security Council resolution endorsing the nuclear deal remained the “binding international legal framework for the resolution of the dispute.” That raises the possibility that the United States will be found to be in violation in the Security Council. Few people were more stung by Mr. Trump’s decision than those who worked for Mr. Obama. Though he has moved methodically to dismantle his predecessor’s legacy, his reversal of the Iran deal was particularly painful, given the five years of effort that went into imposing sanctions, and the more than two-year-long negotiation led by Secretary of State John Kerry that yielded the accord. “No rhetoric is required,” Mr. Kerry said in a statement. “The facts speak for themselves. Instead of building on unprecedented nonproliferation verification measures, this decision risks throwing them away and dragging the world back to the brink we faced a few years ago.” Reporting was contributed by Peter Baker, Alan Rappeport, David E.

"Iran lists demands for staying in nuclear deal","Officials say EU must present credible package by end of May to compensate for US sanctions  Patrick Wintour Diplomatic editor  Fri 25 May 2018 11.39 BST   Last modified on Tue 7 Aug 2018 15.33 BST   Iran has said it will decide in the next few weeks whether to pull out of the nuclear deal signed in 2015 and start enriching uranium capable of making a nuclear bomb. The announcement was made by Tehran as its officials met counterparts from France, Britain, Germany Russian and China in Vienna on Friday to assess how the deal can be kept alive in the face of the reimposition by the US of secondary sanctions designed to cripple any European firm continuing to do business with Iran. President Trump withdrew from the deal despite strenuous European objections on 8 May, adding that old sanctions against contact with the Tehran regime would be reimposed. In the run-up to the Vienna meeting, Tehran officials said the EU would need to present a credible compensation package by the end of the month to make up for the loss of income to Iran caused by the US sanctions. Afterwards, Iran’s deputy foreign minister Abbas Araqchi said he was more confident than before that the deal could survive. “For the time being we are negotiating... to see if they can provide us with a package which can actually give Iran the benefits of sanctions-lifting and then the next step is to find guarantees for that package and we need both legal and political commitments by the remaining participants in the JCPOA [deal],” he said. In July 2015, Iran and a six-nation negotiating group reached a landmark agreement known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action that ended a 12-year deadlock over Tehran’s nuclear programme. The deal, struck in Vienna after nearly two years of intensive talks, limited the Iranian programme, to reassure the rest of the world that it cannot develop nuclear weapons, in return for sanctions relief. At its core, the JCPOA is a straightforward bargain: Iran’s acceptance of strict limits on its nuclear programme in return for an escape from the sanctions that grew up around its economy over a decade prior to the accord. Under the deal, Iran unplugged two-thirds of its centrifuges, shipped out 98% of its enriched uranium and filled its plutonium production reactor with concrete. Tehran also accepted extensive monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which has verified 10 times since the agreement, and as recently as February, that Tehran has complied with its terms. In return, all nuclear-related sanctions were lifted in January 2016 , reconnecting Iran to global markets. The six major powers involved in the nuclear talks with Iran were in a group known as the P5+1: the UN security council’s five permanent members – China, France, Russia, the UK and the US – and Germany. The nuclear deal is also enshrined in a UN security council resolution that incorporated it into international law. The 15 members of the council at the time unanimously endorsed the agreement. Iran is increasingly sceptical that Europe has the means or will to set up an economic firewall that can assure European firms that they will be protected from US Treasury fines if they do business in Iran. Many of the firms trading with Iran, such as the French oil company Total, have substantial US interests and do not want to put those assets at risk to continue trading with Iran. The Vienna meeting being held in the joint commission format was the first such conference without the US, and was in some ways a test of Europe’s commercial and diplomatic ability to follow a foreign policy independent of Washington. Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei this week said his country would stay in the deal on three strict conditions. He said the EU had to protect Iranian oil sales from US sanctions and continued to buy Iranian oil. He also demanded European banks safeguard trade with Iran, including by keeping the country inside the Swift international payments system. Finally, he also urged France, Germany and the UK not to seek a new agreement on Iran’s ballistic missile programme, or its regional activities, including its presence in Yemen, Iraq and Syria. Broadly, Russia and China agree with these terms. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, on Monday outlined a counter set of demands before the country would rejoin the deal that the EU rejected as unrealistic and amounting to regime change in Tehran. The EU fears ever heavier economic sanctions will strengthen hardliners in Tehran, while the US believes a country-wide rebellion can be stoked among a population angry at the regime’s costly overseas military adventures. Speaking in St Petersburg, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, said the US approach to the deal was “not serious”, adding he was comforted by a report from the International Atomic Energy Agency confirming Iran was still abiding by the deal’s key restrictions on its nuclear facilities. He also said companies from France and other European countries should be given an opportunity to “keep their economic profit, despite the US sanctions, and maintain their economic presence in Iran”. Macron added: “Europe should have a stronger economic sovereignty. France envisages a compensation for French companies acting within the framework of treaties signed by France.” The EU is studying three plans to protect trade with Iran – a legally untested blocking statute that renders any US sanctions on EU companies null and void, euro-denominated finance for companies from the European Investment Bank, and an EU equivalent to the US Treasury’s secondary sanctions regime. Macron also said he wanted Iran to complete the nuclear deal by signing a new framework agreement to cover ballistic missiles and its regional activities. He revealed he had spoken to Tehran on the need to agree on what follows the end of the agreement in 2025. It is not clear what the EU will do if Iran pushes back on this plan. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, counselled against anything that resembled reopening the deal, and warned of the lamentable consequences if the deal collapsed. There is intense anger in some European capitals, notably Paris, at the unilateral tone of the US approach, especially the reimposition of sanctions. The premise of the nuclear deal – officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action was to let Iran rejoin the global economy in exchange for denuclearisation. The only EU country so far to support the US withdrawal from the deal is Poland. The most effective weapon in the US economic armoury is to slash Iranian oil exports by isolating Iran’s central bank from the global banking system. About 37% of Iran’s oil exports go to European destinations, and overall the EU is Iran’s number one trading partner. The value of trade between the EU and Iran soared from $9.2bn (£6.9bn) in 2015 to $25bn in 2017."
"May calls for global cooperation at UN and chides Trump over Iran","British prime minister stresses role of united efforts at security council meeting  Peter Walker Political correspondent  Wed 26 Sep 2018 21.34 BST   First published on Wed 26 Sep 2018 18.31 BST   Theresa May has used a pair of speeches at the UN summit in New York to firmly contradict Donald Trump’s isolationist view of the world, arguing that the best way to resist extremist forces was through close cooperation between countries. The prime minister, speaking a day after Trump’s address to the UN general assembly explicitly rejected global cooperation in favour of a “doctrine of patriotism”, even delivered a polite if direct rebuke to the US president over his abandonment of the Iran nuclear deal . May, who was addressing a special session of the UN security council on weapons proliferation chaired by Trump, told the president that the deal remained “the best means of preventing Iran developing a nuclear weapon”. The prime minister, in her main address to the general assembly shortly afterwards, reiterated her call for transnational cooperation, saying public disillusionment about economic and political systems risked a return to influence for far left and far right ideologies. “We have to show there is a better way to meet the concerns of our people,” she said. “That way lies in global cooperation between strong and accountable states based on open economies and inclusive societies.” While Downing Street was adamant that May’s choice of words was not intended to be critical of Trump, whom she was meeting one-to-one in a final engagement before leaving New York on Wednesday evening, the strong language would be seen by many as a counterpoint to Trump’s stark statement to the UN: “We reject the ideology of globalism and we embrace the doctrine of patriotism.” She did also say countries should address the worries of “those who feel that the global economy is not working for them”, citing reform of the World Trade Organization as one area where action was needed. In her security council speech May also warned of potential renewed military action if chemical weapons were again used in Syria . Russia and other backers of Syria’s government should seek to avoid repeated use of chemical weapons, she said, adding: “For there must be no doubt: we will respond swiftly and appropriately if they are.” May also condemned what she said was Russia’s “desperate fabrication” in response to the Salisbury nerve agent attack. On Iran, May said the long-negotiated international deal on the country’s nuclear programme, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), had been “an important step forward” in addressing worries about Tehran’s nuclear ambitions. She said: “It remains the best means of preventing Iran developing a nuclear weapon, and we are committed to preserving the JCPOA as long as Iran continues to abide by its obligations in full.” Trump announced in May he was breaking with European allies over the Iran deal, and signed an executive order reimposing sanctions on any foreign company that continued to do business with Iran. May has repeatedly and publicly disagreed with Trump over his decision. She praised Trump for his talks with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un , saying this had “created a historic opportunity for complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation” on the Korean peninsula. But here, too, she played up the role of international cooperation, saying previous sanctions imposed by the UN “played no small part” in getting Kim to the negotiating table. May, in her condemnation of Russia over the novichok attack in Salisbury, said: “We have taken appropriate action, with our allies, and we will continue to take the necessary steps to ensure our collective security. Russia has only sought to obfuscate through desperate fabrication.” More widely, May praised the multilateral treaties on weapons proliferation as “one of the greatest achievements of the international community, demonstrating the value of global cooperation”. She said: “It has improved all of our security. It has brought a measure of predictability and stability. And it has paved the way to arms control agreements and disarmament.” May ended by again reminding Trump about the benefits of cross-national work: “Mr President, it was collective engagement by states across the globe that produced the counter-proliferation framework. “Even the most powerful recognised that investing in collective rules-based restraint was the only effective way of addressing national security interests and avoiding unilateral recourse to force.” Despite her criticism of Trump’s strategy, the prime minister later held talks with him in New York, where they discussed the issue of a US-UK trade deal following Brexit. “They agreed that Brexit provides a wonderful opportunity to strike a big and ambitious UK-US free trade agreement,” a No 10 statement said. They also discussed Syria , and taking action against what Downing Street called “Iran’s destabilising regional activity”. The White House statement on the talks cited discussions on various international situations, but made no mention of a trade deal. May, asked by reporters ahead of the talks how the British people could believe Trump would stick to his word over trade, given his habit of sometimes changing his mind about international agreements and his tendency to routinely say things that are untrue , argued he had shown trustworthiness. She cited examples including the US’s decision to expel Russian diplomats in the wake of the novichok nerve agent attack on Salisbury. This meant he could be trusted on a trade deal, May said, arguing the omens were positive: “It’s in both our interests to do that good trade deal, and I believe that when we have negotiated that deal it will indeed be put in place.”"
"Literature provides shelter. That's why we need it","In her Arthur Miller Freedom to Write Lecture, published here, Arundhati Roy asks what it means to be a writer in a world that is rapidly hardening  Mon 13 May 2019 13.23 BST   Last modified on Fri 17 May 2019 23.43 BST   I am truly honored to have been invited by PEN America to deliver this year’s Arthur Miller Freedom to Write Lecture. What better time than this to think together about a place for literature, at this moment when an era that we think we understand – at least vaguely, if not well – is coming to a close. As the ice caps melt, as oceans heat up, and water tables plunge, as we rip through the delicate web of interdependence that sustains life on earth, as our formidable intelligence leads us to breach the boundaries between humans and machines, and our even more formidable hubris undermines our ability to connect the survival of our planet to our survival as a species, as we replace art with algorithms and stare into a future in which most human beings may not be needed to participate in (or be remunerated for) economic activity – at just such a time we have the steady hands of white supremacists in the White House, new imperialists in China, neo-Nazis once again massing on the streets of Europe, Hindu nationalists in India, and a host of butcher-princes and lesser dictators in other countries to guide us into the Unknown. While many of us dreamt that “Another world is possible”, these folks were dreaming that too. And it is their dream – our nightmare – that is perilously close to being realized. Capitalism’s gratuitous wars and sanctioned greed have jeopardized the planet and filled it with refugees. Much of the blame for this rests squarely on the shoulders of the government of the United States. Seventeen years after invading Afghanistan, after bombing it into the ‘stone age’ with the sole aim of toppling the Taliban, the US government is back in talks with the very same Taliban. In the interim it has destroyed Iraq, Libya and Syria. Hundreds of thousands have lost their lives to war and sanctions, a whole region has descended into chaos, ancient cities—pounded into dust. Amidst the desolation and the rubble, a monstrosity called Daesh (Isis) has been spawned. It has spread across the world, indiscriminately murdering ordinary people who had absolutely nothing to do with America’s wars. Over these last few years, given the wars it has waged, and the international treaties it has arbitrarily reneged on, the US government perfectly fits its own definition of a rogue state. And now, resorting to the same old scare tactics, the same tired falsehoods and the same old fake news about nuclear weapons, it is gearing up to bomb Iran. That will be the biggest mistake it has ever made. So, as we lurch into the future, in this blitzkrieg of idiocy, Facebook “likes,” fascist marches, fake-news coups, and what looks like a race toward extinction—what is literature’s place? What counts as literature? Who decides? Obviously, there is no single, edifying answer to these questions. So, if you will forgive me, I’m going to talk about my own experience of being a writer during these times—of grappling with the question of how to be a writer during these times, in particular in a country like India, a country that lives in several centuries simultaneously. A few years ago, I was in a railway station, reading the papers while I waited for my train. On an inside page, I spotted a small news report about two men who had been arrested and charged with being couriers for the banned, underground Communist Party of India (Maoist). Among the “items” recovered from the men, the report said, were “some books by Arundhati Roy.” Not long after that, I met a college lecturer who spent much of her time organizing legal defence for jailed activists, many of them young students and villagers in prison for “anti-national activities”. For the most part this meant protesting corporate mining and infrastructure projects that were displacing tens of thousands from their lands and homes. She told me that in several of the prisoners’ “confessions” – usually extracted under coercion – my writing often merited a reference as a factor that led them down what the police call “the wrong path.” “They’re laying a trail – building a case against you,” she said. The books in question were not my novels (at that point I had written only one – The God of Small Things). These were books of nonfiction – although in a sense they were stories, too, different kinds of stories, but stories nevertheless. Stories about the massive corporate attack on forests, rivers, crops, seeds, on land, on farmers, labour laws, on policy making itself. And yes, on the post 9/11 US and Nato attacks on country after country. Most were stories about people who have fought against these attacks – specific stories, about specific rivers, specific mountains, specific corporations, specific peoples’ movements, all of them being specifically crushed in specific ways. These were the real climate warriors, local people with a global message, who had understood the crisis before it was recognized as one. And yet, they were consistently portrayed as villains—the anti-national impediments to progress and development. The former Prime Minister of India, a free-market evangelist, called the guerrillas, mostly indigenous people, adivasis, fighting corporate mining projects in the forests of central India the “Single Largest Internal Security Challenge”. A war called “Operation Green Hunt” was declared on them. The forests were flooded with soldiers whose enemies were the poorest people in the world. It’s been no different elsewhere – in Africa, Australia, Latin America. And now, irony of ironies, a consensus is building that climate change is the world’s single largest security challenge. Increasingly the vocabulary around it is being militarized. And no doubt very soon its victims will become the ‘enemies’ in the new war without end. Calls for a climate ‘emergency’, although well meaning, could hasten the process that has already begun. The pressure is already on to move the debate from the UNFCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) to the United Nations Security Council, in other words, to exclude most of the world and place decision making straight back into the den of the same old suspects. Once again, the Global North, the creators of the problem, will see to it that they profit from the solution that they propose. A solution whose genius will, no doubt, lie deep in the heart of the ‘Market’ and involve more selling and buying, more consuming, and more profiteering by fewer and fewer people. In other words, more capitalism. When the essays were first published (first in mass-circulation magazines, then on the Internet, and finally as books), they were viewed with baleful suspicion, at least in some quarters, often by those who didn’t necessarily even disagree with the politics. The writing sat at an angle to what is conventionally thought of as literature. Balefulness was an understandable reaction, particularly among the taxonomy-inclined—because they couldn’t decide exactly what this was—pamphlet or polemic, academic or journalistic writing, travelogue, or just plain literary adventurism? To some, it simply did not count as writing: “Oh, why have you stopped writing? We’re waiting for your next book.” Others imagined that I was just a pen for hire. All manner of offers came my way: “Darling I loved that piece you wrote on the dams, could you do one for me on child abuse?” (This actually happened.) I was sternly lectured, (mostly by upper-caste men) about how to write, the subjects I should write about, and the tone I should take. But in other places, let’s call them places off the highway, the essays were quickly translated into other Indian languages, printed as pamphlets, distributed for free in forests and river valleys, in villages that were under attack, on university campuses where students were fed up of being lied to. Because these readers, out there on the frontlines, already being singed by the spreading fire, had an entirely different idea of what literature is or should be. I mention this because it taught me that the place for literature is built by writers and readers. It’s a fragile place in some ways, but an indestructible one. When its broken, we rebuild it. Because we need shelter. I very much like the idea of literature that is needed. Literature that provides shelter. Shelter of all kinds. Over time, an unspoken compromise was arrived at. I began to be called a “writer-activist.” Implicit in this categorization was that the fiction was not political and the essays were not literary. I remember sitting in a lecture hall in a college in Hyderabad in front of an audience of five or six hundred students. On my left, chairing the event, was the vice-chancellor of the university. On my right, a professor of poetry. The vice-chancellor whispered in my ear, “You shouldn’t spend any more time on fiction. Your political writing is the thing to concentrate on.” The professor of poetry whispered, “When will you get back to writing fiction? That is your true calling. This other stuff you do is just ephemeral.” I have never felt that my fiction and nonfiction were warring factions battling for suzerainty. They aren’t the same certainly, but trying to pin down the difference between them is actually harder than I imagined. Fact and fiction are not converse. One is not necessarily truer than the other, more factual than the other, or more real than the other. Or even, in my case, more widely read than the other. All I can say is that I feel the difference in my body when I’m writing. Sitting between the two professors, I enjoyed their contradictory advice. I sat there smiling, thinking of the first message I received from John Berger. It was a beautiful handwritten letter, from a writer who had been my hero for years: “Your fiction and nonfiction—they walk you around the world like your two legs.” That settled it for me. Whatever the case that was being built against me was, it didn’t – or at least hasn’t yet – come to fruition. I’m still here, standing on my two writing legs, speaking to you. But my lecturer friend is in jail, charged with participating in anti-national activity. India’s prisons are packed tight with political prisoners—most of them accused of being either Maoist or Islamist terrorists. These terms have been defined so broadly that they have come to include almost anyone who disagrees with government policy. In the latest batch of pre-election arrests, teachers, lawyers, activists, and writers have been jailed, charged with plotting to assassinate Prime Minister Modi. The plot is so ludicrous that a six-year old could have improved on it. The fascists need to take some good fiction-writing courses. Reporters Without Borders say that India is the fifth most dangerous place for journalists in the world, ranked just above Afghanistan, Syria, Yemen and Mexico. Here I must pause to thank PEN for the work it does to protect writers and journalists who are have been imprisoned, prosecuted, censored and worse. From one day to the next, it could be any one of us that is in the line of fire. To know that there is an organization looking out for us is a consolation. In India, those who’ve been jailed are the lucky ones. The less fortunate are dead. Gauri Lankesh, Narendra Dabholkar, MM Kalburgi, and Govind Pansare, all critics of the Hindu far right, have been assassinated. Theirs were the high-profile killings. Scores of other activists working with the Right to Information Act to uncover massive corruption scandals have been killed or found dead in suspicious circumstances. Over the last five years, India has distinguished itself as a lynching nation. Muslims and Dalits have been publicly flogged and beaten to death by vigilante Hindu mobs in broad daylight, and the “lynch videos” then gleefully uploaded to YouTube. The violence is flagrant, open and certainly not spontaneous. Although the violence against Muslims is not new and the violence against Dalits is ancient – these lynchings have a clear ideological underpinning. The lynchers know that they have protection in the highest places. Protection not just from the government and the prime minister, but from the organization that controls them both—the far-right, proto-fascist Rashtriya Swayam Sevak Sangh (RSS), the most secretive and most powerful organization in India. It was founded in 1925, its founding ideologues were greatly influenced by European fascism. They openly praised Hitler and Mussolini, and compared Indian Muslims to the “Jews of Germany”. It has worked ceaselessly for 95 years toward having India formally declared a Hindu Nation. Its declared enemies are Muslims, Christians, and Communists. The RSS runs a shadow government that functions through tens of thousands of shakhas (branches) and other ideologically affiliated organizations with different names – some of them astonishingly violent – spread across the country. Traditionally controlled by a sect of west coast Brahmins. known as Chitpavan Brahmins, the RSS today has white supremacists and racists from the United States and Europe circling around it, writing in praise of Hinduism’s age-old practice of caste. It’s what is more accurately known as Brahminism – a brutal system of social hierarchy they envy for its elaborate, institutionalized cruelty, which has survived more or less intact from ancient times. Brahminism also has admirers in the most unexpected places. One of them, you will be saddened to know, was Mohandas Gandhi – who considered caste to be the “genius” of Hindu society. I have written at length about Gandhi’s attitude toward caste and race in a book called The Doctor and The Saint, so I will not dwell on it now. Let me just leave you with this: at a speech at a missionary conference in Madras in 1916, he said: “The vast organisation of caste answered not only the religious wants of the community, but it answered too its political needs. The villagers managed their internal affairs through the caste system, and through it they dealt with any oppression from the ruling power or powers. It is not possible to deny the organising capability of a nation that was capable of producing the caste system its wonderful power of organisation.” Today the RSS boasts of having a trained militia of six hundred thousand members who proudly call themselves swayam-sevaks (volunteers), whose numbers include the prime minister and most of his cabinet. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) functions as the parliamentary political department of the RSS. Ram Madhav, its secretary is a member of the RSS. By insisting on viewing the BJP as an independent entity, as an ordinary, right wing, conservative political party, by inadvertently or deliberately minimizing its organic connection to the RSS, many in the Indian and the international media, as well as many who claim to be secular and liberal, have eased its path to political power. Modi’s mainstream political career was launched, coincidentally, (or maybe not) just weeks after 9/11, when, he was appointed as the chief minister of the state of Gujarat, although he was not an elected member of the Legislative Assembly. Within months of that appointment, under Modi’s watch, a pogrom against Muslims took place in Gujarat, in which two thousand people were killed in broad daylight. Within months he called elections and won. At a grand convention of businessmen and industrialists in Gujarat, CEOs of several of India’s major corporations openly endorsed him as their future candidate for prime minister. Fascism and capitalism exchanged marriage vows in a not-so-quiet ceremony and moved in together. After three terms as Gujarat’s chief minister, Modi was elected prime minister of India in 2014. He was given a hero’s welcome by the liberal commentariat and he has traveled the world embracing and being embraced by world leaders, including Barack Obama and Emmanuel Macron. And Donald Trump of course, but that is no surprise. None of them is ignorant about who Modi really is, but all of them have something to sell to this “market” of more than a billion people. Now after five years in office and a vicious communal campaign, he and his cohorts, are seeking re-election. The candidates include a saffron robed Sadhvi Pragya, who is standing trial for being part of a terrorist strike that killed six people and is currently out on bail. In what marks a dangerous turn of events, newspapers reported a public speech by Maneka Gandhi, a union minister in Modi’s cabinet in which she said that villages would be graded according to which ones voted for the BJP in the greatest numbers and they would be rewarded or punished by the award or withholding of ‘development’ proportionate to their loyalty. She is by no means the only one speaking this language, by no means the only one who has openly suggested that the Party knows who has voted for it and who has not. And that retribution will follow. And by no means the first to hint that political parties have access to data from what is supposed to be a secret ballot—data they can use to their advantage in dangerous ways that completely undermine elections and democracy itself. In the era of surveillance capitalism, a few people will know everything about us, and will use this information to control us. India is fighting for her soul. Even if the BJP loses the elections, which, despite having more money than all the other political parties put together, despite its more or less complete control of the mainstream media, it well might—it will not mean that we are out of danger. The RSS is chameleon-like, and moves on a million legs. Capturing power with an absolute majority, as it did five years ago, put motors on those legs. But merely losing an election will not prevent it from continuing its long walk to hell. It can change colour when it has to, wear a mask of reason and inclusiveness when it needs to. It has proved its ability to function as an underground organization as well as an over ground one. It is a patient, hardworking beast that has burrowed its way into every institution in the country – courts, universities, media outlets, security forces, intelligence services. If a new, non-BJP government is sworn in – most likely a fragile coalition – it is likely to be met by a ferocious onslaught of manufactured communal violence and false-flag attacks to which we have become accustomed. There will be cow carcases discovered on highways, beef found in temples and pigs thrown into mosques. When the country burns the far right will once again present themselves to us as the only ones capable of running a ‘hard-state’ and handling the problem. Will a polity that has been deeply polarised be able to see through these games? It’s hard to say. Much of this has been the subject of my writing, fiction as well as nonfiction, for several years. . . . The God of Small Things, published in the summer of 1997, was the result of a search for a language and a form to describe the world I had grown up in, to myself and to people I loved, some of whom were entirely unfamiliar with Kerala. I had studied architecture, written screenplays, and now I wanted to write a novel. A novel that could only be a novel—not a novel that really wanted to be a film, or a manifesto, or sociological treatise of some kind. I was astonished when some critics described it as a work of magical realism—how could that be? The setting of the book—the old house on the hill in Ayemenem, my grandmother’s pickle factory that I grew up in, (I still have some of the jars and labels), the Meenachal river—all of it gritty reality to me, was exotic and magical to many western critics. Fair enough. But I reserve the right to think that way about New York and London. Back home in Kerala, the reception was pretty unmagical. The Communist party of India (Marxist), which had ruled Kerala on and off since 1959, was upset with what it considered a critique of the party in The God of Small Things. I was quickly labeled anti-communist, a crying-talking-sleeping-walking Imperialist Plot. I had been critical, it is true, and the sharp end of my critique was that the Left, by which I mean the various communist parties in India, has been not just opaque to caste, but, more often than not, overtly casteist. The transgressive relationship in the novel between Ammu (a Syrian Christian woman) and Velutha (a Dalit man) was viewed with consternation. The consternation had as much to do with the novel’s politics of caste as it did with gender. The portrayal of one of the main characters, Comrade KNM Pillai’s relationship with his wife Kalyani, and of Ammu, a divorced woman who “combined the infinite tenderness of motherhood and the reckless rage of a suicide bomber”, “who loved by night the man who her children loved by day,” was not received with applause and hallelujahs. Five male lawyers got together and filed a criminal case against me, accusing me of obscenity and “corrupting public morality.” There were factors outside of the novel that were swirling around too. My mother, Mary Roy, had won a case in the Supreme Court that struck down the Syrian Christian Inheritance Law, which gave a woman “one fourth of her father’s property or Rs. 5,000, [$70] whichever is less.” Women could now inherit an equal share. This caused a great deal of anger. There was a palpable sense that mother and daughter needed to be taught a lesson. By the time the case came up for its third or fourth hearing The God of Small Things had won the Booker prize. That divided public opinion. A local Malayali woman, winning a prestigious international literary prize was not something that could be easily dismissed—should she be shunned or embraced? I was present in court with my lawyer, who had told me in confidence that he thought that parts of my book were “quite obscene.” But, he said, according to the law, a work of art should be seen as a whole and since the whole book was not obscene, we stood a fighting chance. The judge took his seat and said, “Every time this case comes before me, I get chest pains.” He postponed the hearing. The judges who came after him did the same. Meanwhile people celebrated the nontransgressive aspects of the book – the language, the evocation of childhood. It’s still hard for many to look at the relationship between Ammu and Velutha without flinching a little. It took almost 10 years before the case was dismissed. In May 1998, less than a year after the publication of The God of Small Things, for the first time in India’s history, a BJP-led coalition formed the government at the centre. The prime minister at the time, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, was a member of the RSS. Within weeks of taking office, he fulfilled a longstanding dream of the RSS by conducting a series of nuclear tests. Pakistan responded immediately with tests of its own. The nuclear tests were the beginning of the journey toward the crazed rhetoric of nationalism that has become a normal form of public speech in India today. I was taken aback by the orgy of celebration that greeted the nuclear tests—including from the most unexpected quarters. That was when I wrote my first essay, “The End of Imagination,” condemning the tests. I said that entering the nuclear race would colonize our imagination: “If it’s anti-Indian and anti-Hindu to have a nuclear bomb implanted in my brain,” I wrote, “then I secede. I hereby declare myself a mobile republic.” I will leave you to imagine the reaction that followed. “The End of Imagination” was the first of what would turn out to be 20 years of writing nonfiction essays. They were years during which India was changing at lightning speed. For each essay, I searched for a form, for language, for structure and narrative. Could I write as compellingly about irrigation as I could about love and loss and childhood? About the salinization of soil? About drainage? Dams? Crops? About structural adjustment and privatization? About the per unit cost of electricity? About things that affect ordinary peoples’ lives? Not as reportage, but as a form of storytelling? Was it possible to turn these topics into literature? Literature for everybody—including for people who couldn’t read and write, but who had taught me how to think, and could be read to? I tried. And as the essays kept appearing, so did the five male lawyers (not the same ones, different ones, but they seemed to hunt in packs). And so did the criminal cases, mostly for contempt of court. One of them ended in a very short jail sentence, another is still pending. The debates were often acrimonious. Sometimes violent. But always important. Almost every essay got me into enough trouble to make me promise myself that I wouldn’t write another. But inevitably, situations arose in which the effort of keeping quiet set up such a noise in my head, such an ache in my blood, that I succumbed, and wrote. Last year when my publishers suggested they be collected into a single volume, I was shocked to see that the collection, My Seditious Heart, is a thousand pages long. After twenty years of writing, traveling into the heart of rebellions, meeting most extraordinary as well as exquisitely ordinary people, fiction returned to me. It became clear that only a novel would be able to contain the universe that was building in me, spinning up from the landscapes I had wandered through, and composing itself into a story-universe. I knew it would be unapologetically complicated, unapologetically political, and unapologetically intimate. I knew that if The God of Small Things was about home, about a family with a broken heart in its midst, The Ministry of Utmost Happiness would begin after the roof had blown off the home, and the broken heart had shattered and distributed its shards in war-torn valleys and city streets. It would be a novel, but the story-universe would refuse all forms of domestication and conventions about what a novel could and could not be. It would be like a great city in my part of the world in which the reader arrives as a new immigrant. A little frightened, a little intimidated, plenty excited. The only way to know it would be to walk through it, get lost, and learn to live in it. Learn to meet people, small and big. Learn to love the crowd. It would be a novel that would say what cannot otherwise be said. Particularly about Kashmir, where only fiction can be true because the truth cannot be told. In India, it is not possible to speak of Kashmir with any degree of honesty without risking bodily harm. About the story of Kashmir and India and India and Kashmir, I can do no better than to quote James Baldwin: “And they would not believe me, precisely because they would know that what I said was true.” The story of Kashmir is not the sum of its human rights reports. It’s not only about massacres, torture, disappearance, and mass graves, or about victims and their oppressors. Some of the most terrifying things that happen in Kashmir would not necessarily qualify as human rights violations. For a writer, Kashmir holds great lessons about the human substance. About power, powerlessness, treachery, loyalty, love, humor, faith… What happens to people who live under a military occupation for decades? What are the negotiations that take place when the very air is seeded with terror? What happens to language? One of the first things I began to do when I began to travel in Kashmir is to collate what appears in The Ministry of Utmost Happiness as “The Kashmiri-English Alphabet,” starting with the letter A: A: Azadi/army/Allah/America/Attack/AK-47/Ammunition/Ambush/Aatankwadi/Armed Forces Special Powers Act/Area Domination/Al Badr/Al Mansoorian/Al Jehad/Afghan/Amarnath Yatra B: BSF/body/blast/bullet/battalion/barbed wire/brust (burst)/border cross/booby trap/bunker/ bite/begaar (forced labour) C: Cross-border/Crossfire/camp/civilian/curfew/Crackdown/Cordon-and-Search/CRPF/ Checkpost/Counter-insurgency/Ceasefire/Counter-Intelligence/Catch and Kill/ Custodial Killing/Compensation/Cylinder (surrender)/Concertina wire/Collaborator And so on…. Also: What happens to people who administer, digest, and justify the horror? What happens to people who allow it to go on and on—in their name? The narrative of Kashmir is a jigsaw puzzle whose jagged parts do not fit together. There is no final picture. Strange people made their way onto my pages. Foremost among them, Biplab Dasgupta, an intelligence officer. I was unnerved when he arrived, speaking in the first person. I thought I was in his head, and realized later that perhaps he was in mine. What was chilling about him was not his villainy but his reasonableness, his intelligence, his wit, his self-deprecation, his vulnerability. Even still, none of Dasgupta’s sophistication and erudite political analysis can see what the building contractor, Mr DD Gupta, one of the minor characters in The Ministry of Utmost Happiness easily can. Mr Gupta has returned to India from Iraq, after several years of earning his living building blast walls – pictures of which he proudly stores in his mobile phone. Sickened by what he has seen and lived through in Iraq, he looks around at the place he used to think of as home. His considered assessment of what is happening in his own country is that all of it in the long run will only end up creating a market for blast walls. Novels can bring their authors to the brink of madness. Novels can shelter their authors, too. As a writer, I protected the characters in The God of Small Things, because they were vulnerable. Many of the characters in The Ministry of Utmost Happiness are, for the most part, even more vulnerable. But they protect me. Especially Anjum, who was born as Aftab, who ends up as the proprietor and Manager of the Jannat Guest House, located in a derelict Muslim graveyard just outside the walls of Old Delhi. Anjum softens the borders between men and women, between animals and humans and between life and death. I go to her when I need shelter from the tyranny of hard borders in this increasingly hardening world."
"Behind Trump’s Termination of Iran Deal Is a Risky Bet","Advertisement Supported by News Analysis By  David E. Sanger and David D. Kirkpatrick WASHINGTON — For President Trump and two of the allies he values most — Israel and Saudi Arabia — the problem of the Iranian nuclear accord was not, primarily, about nuclear weapons. It was that the deal legitimized and normalized Iran’s clerical government, reopening it to the world economy with oil revenue that financed its adventures in Syria and Iraq, its missile program and its support of terrorist groups. Now, by announcing on Tuesday that he is exiting the nuclear deal and will reimpose economic sanctions on Iran and companies around the world that do business with the country, Mr. Trump is engaged in a grand, highly risky experiment. Mr. Trump and his Middle East allies are betting they can cut Iran’s economic lifeline and thus “break the regime,” as one senior European official described the effort. In theory, America’s withdrawal could free Iran to produce as much nuclear material as it wants — as it was doing five years ago, when the world feared that it was headed toward a bomb. But Mr. Trump’s team dismisses that risk: Iran does not have the economic strength to confront the United States, Israel and Saudi Arabia. And Iran knows that any move to produce a weapon would only provide Israel and the United States with a rationale for taking military action. It is a brutally realpolitik approach that America’s allies in Europe have warned is a historic mistake, one that could lead to confrontation, and perhaps to war. And it is a clear example of Middle East brinkmanship that runs counter to what President Barack Obama intended when the nuclear deal was struck in July 2015. Mr. Obama’s gamble in that deal — the signature foreign policy accord of his eight years in office — was straightforward. He regarded Iran as potentially a more natural ally of the United States than many of its Sunni-dominant neighbors, with a young, educated Western-oriented population that is tired of being ruled by an aging theocracy. By taking the prospect of nuclear weapons off the table, the Obama administration had argued, the United States and Iran could chip away at three decades of hostility and work on common projects, starting with the defeat of the Islamic State. It did not turn out that way. While the deal succeeded in getting 97 percent of Iran’s nuclear material out of the country, Iran’s conservatives and its military recoiled at the idea of cooperating on any projects with the West. Months before it became clear that Mr. Trump had a decent shot at being elected, the Iranian military increased support for President Bashar al-Assad in Syria; it expanded its influence in Iraq and accelerated its support for terrorist groups. And it doubled down on deploying cyberattacks against targets in the West and in Saudi Arabia, embracing a weapon that was not covered by the nuclear accord. Then came Mr. Trump, with his declaration that the deal was a “disaster” and his vow to dismantle it. That is exactly what he has now done, but at a huge cost. Moments after he delivered his statement — in which he made it sound as if Iran was cheating on the accord, even though his intelligence chiefs have testified otherwise — Mr. Trump received a stinging rebuke from Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain, President Emmanuel Macron of France and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany. The three leaders, America’s closest European allies, essentially rejected his logic. They noted that the United Nations Security Council resolution that embraced the Iran deal in 2016 “remains the binding international legal framework for the resolution of the dispute about the Iranian nuclear program.” That was polite diplomatic language for the stark conclusion that it is the United States — not Iran — that first violated the accord. And now, suddenly, the world may well be headed back to where it was in 2012: on a road to uncertain confrontation, with “very little evidence of a Plan B,” as Boris Johnson, the British foreign minister, said on a visit to Washington. Exiting the deal, with or without a plan, is fine with the Saudis. They see the accord as a dangerous distraction from the real problem of confronting Iran around the region — a problem that Saudi Arabia believes will be solved only by leadership change in Iran. The Saudis have an ally in John R. Bolton, the president’s new national security adviser, who had made clear before taking office that he shared their view. Mr. Obama’s deal, Mr. Bolton said on Tuesday afternoon, featured “an utterly inadequate treatment of the military dimension of Iran’s aspirations.” The Saudi case against Iran has been bolstered in recent months by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has repeatedly referred to Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, as “the new Hitler.” “Many countries around the world and in Europe did not realize how dangerous Hitler was until what happened, happened,” Prince Mohammed said in a recent interview with the CBS News program “60 Minutes.” “I don’t want to see the same events happening in the Middle East.” In a speech in March at the Brookings Institution, Adel al-Jubeir, the Saudi foreign minister, asserted that Iran was “the biggest problem we face in our region.” He blamed Iran for interfering in neighboring countries, backing allied armed groups in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, Yemen and elsewhere, and supplying Yemeni rebels with ballistic missiles they fired at his country. Even if its restrictions on nuclear weapons were tightened and extended, “the agreement by itself does not solve the problem of Iran,” Mr. Jubeir said. “Iran must be held accountable.” Jeremy Shapiro, research director at the European Council on Foreign Relations and a State Department official during the Obama administration, argued that the nuclear deal’s opposition from Saudi Arabia, Israel and other regional players was primarily about its effects on American politics and policy. “They believe they are in this existential conflict with the Iranian regime, and nuclear weapons are a small part of that conflict” — but the one that most influences public opinion in the United States, Mr. Shapiro said. “If the deal opened an avenue for better relations between the United States and Iran, that would be a disaster for the Saudis,” he said. “They need to ensure a motivation for American pressure against Iran that will last even after this administration.” Israel is a more complicated case. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has pressed Mr. Trump to abandon an arrangement that the Israeli leader has always detested. But Mr. Netanyahu’s own military and intelligence advisers say Israel is far safer with an Iran whose pathway to a bomb is blocked, rather than one that is once again pursuing the ultimate weapon. “The individuals who shoulder responsibility for Israel’s survival and security have been crystal clear,” Graham Allison, a Harvard professor who has spent his career examining cases of nuclear proliferation. “This will most likely lead to an outcome that is much worse not only for the U.S., but for Israel,’’ Mr. Allison said, because the current agreement rolled Iran’s nuclear program back a decade “and imposed on Iran the most intrusive inspection regime ever negotiated.” But Mr. Netanyahu holds Israel’s bullhorn, and he used it last week to persuade Mr. Trump to pull the plug on the Iran deal. By releasing Iranian documents, stolen from Tehran in January, Mr. Netanyahu proved what Western intelligence agencies long knew: A decade ago or even longer, the Iranians were working hard to design a nuclear warhead. To Mr. Netanyahu, this was proof that Iran could never be trusted and that it had reached the nuclear deal under false pretenses by pretending it never had a weapons program. To Mr. Trump and his allies, the Israeli discovery said less about Iranian nuclear capability than it did about Iranian perfidy. Given evidence that Iran was preserving its bomb designs as a hedge for the future, the discovery suggested it has not given up its ambitions. As Dennis Ross, a former Middle East negotiator, put it, someone needed to address the Israeli discovery “lest they give the Iranians the ability to pick up quickly where they left off on weaponizing.” Still, at the core of Mr. Trump’s announcement on Tuesday is a conviction that Mr. Obama made a critical mistake in agreeing to a deal that contains an expiration date. Mr. Trump’s argument is that Iran can never be allowed to accumulate enough material to assemble a bomb. So when the Europeans said that would require reopening the negotiations, Mr. Trump balked, and decided instead to scrap the entire deal. It was a classic Trumpian move, akin to the days when he would knock down New York buildings to make way for visions of grander, more glorious edifices. But in this case, it is about upsetting a global power balance and weakening a government that Mr. Trump has argued, since he began campaigning, must go.

"The Iran Nuclear Deal – A Simple Guide","Advertisement  By WILLIAM J. BROAD and  SERGIO PEÇANHA   UPDATED Jan. 15, 2015   Negotiators reached a historic accord last summer to limit Tehran’s nuclear ability in return for lifting international oil and financial sanctions. Here is a guide to the Iran nuclear deal .   An atomic bomb can be made from two types of radioactive materials: uranium or plutonium. The talks were aimed at curbing Iran’s ability to put  these two elements to use in weapons. In each case, the manufacturing starts with uranium ore. Uranium mined from the earth is less than 1 percent  U-235, the isotope that can be used to fuel reactors and make bombs. Centrifuges are needed to separate the U-235 from the rest of the uranium, in a process called enrichment. The other fuel that can be used to make a bomb, plutonium, is made by irradiating uranium in a nuclear reactor. The process transforms some of the uranium into plutonium.  Path 1 Uranium Centrifuges Uranium ore Path 2 Reactor Plutonium Path 1 Uranium Centrifuges Uranium ore Path 2 Reactor Plutonium Uranium ore Centrifuges Reactor Uranium Plutonium  During the enrichment process, centrifuges are used to raise concentrations of U-235. For most power reactors in the West, uranium is enriched up to 5 percent. Bomb grade is above 90 percent and Iran had been processing ore to 20 percent enrichment.  The agreement Iran has agreed to transform its deeply buried plant at Fordo into a center for science research. Another uranium plant, Natanz, is to be cut back rather than shut down. Some 5,000 centrifuges for enriching uranium will remain spinning there, about half the current number.

Iran has also agreed to limit enrichment to 3.7 percent and to cap its stockpile of low-enriched uranium at 300 kilograms, or 660 pounds, for 15 years. That is considered insufficient for a bomb rush.

The agreement Iran has agreed to redesign and rebuild the Arak reactor so it will not produce weapons-grade plutonium. The original core of the reactor, which would enable the production of weapons-grade plutonium, will be made inoperable, but will stay in the country. Under the terms of  the deal, the reactor’s spent fuel, which could also be used to produce a bomb, will be shipped out of the country. Iran will not build any additional heavy water reactors for 15 years.

Western allies say the new inspections must be far more intrusive than those in the past, given the deal’s sweeping terms as well as Iran’s history of evasions, stonewalling and illicit procurements. The principal concerns are how to detect cheating and covert sites.  The agreement Iran has agreed to provide the International Atomic Energy Agency greater access and information regarding its nuclear program, and to allow the agency to investigate suspicious sites or allegations of covert facilities related to uranium enrichment anywhere in the country. Inspectors will also have access to the supply chain that supports Iran’s nuclear program, including uranium mines and mills, and to continuous surveillance of centrifuge manufacturing and storage facilities.   The deal requires Iran to reduce its current stockpile of low-enriched uranium by 98 percent, and limits Iran’s enrichment capacity and research and development for 15 years. Some inspections and transparency measures will remain in place for as long as 25 years. According to President Obama: “This relief will be phased in. Iran must complete key nuclear steps before it begins to receive sanctions relief.” Sanctions for arms could be lifted in five years, ballistic missiles in eight.   The agreement increases the “breakout” time — the amount of time it would take Iran to produce enough bomb-grade material for a singular nuclear weapon — to at least one year.

"Trump Takes Aim at Kerry — Again — Ahead of Announcement on Iran Deal","Advertisement Supported by Fact Check By  Linda Qiu WASHINGTON — President Trump is again warning John Kerry, the former secretary of state, to keep out of discussions over whether to remain in the Iran nuclear deal — a decision the White House is expected to announce on Tuesday . John Kerry can’t get over the fact that he had his chance and blew it! Stay away from negotiations John, you are hurting your country! A day earlier, the president accused Mr. Kerry, who helped broker the 2015 nuclear deal, of engaging in “possibly illegal Shadow Diplomacy” — a charge disputed by some legal scholars who say the same characterization could have applied to Mr. Trump when he was a candidate. The United States does not need John Kerry’s possibly illegal Shadow Diplomacy on the very badly negotiated Iran Deal.  He was the one that created this MESS in the first place! The 2015 accord among world powers limited Tehran’s nuclear program in exchange for lifting international sanctions against Iran. A parade of European diplomats have in recent weeks urged the Trump administration not to abandon the agreement. Mr. Kerry has also been trying to save it . He has strategized with Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif of Iran, met with European officials and lobbied members of Congress. Mr. Trump did not specify what was illegal about Mr. Kerry’s actions, and the White House would not comment. But Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer, accused Mr. Kerry of “violating the Logan Act,” adding, “And nobody seems to care.” As The New York Times’s Charlie Savage has previously explained : The Logan Act is a 1799 statute that bars private citizens from interfering with diplomatic relations between the United States and foreign governments. It makes it a felony, punishable by a fine or imprisonment of up to three years, if an American citizen, without government authorization, interacts “with any foreign government or any officer or agent thereof, with intent to influence the measures or conduct of any foreign government or of any officer or agent thereof, in relation to any disputes or controversies with the United States, or to defeat the measures of the United States.” A spokesman for Mr. Kerry declined to comment on Monday on Mr. Trump’s charges of illegality. A statement released by Mr. Kerry’s office said he “stays in touch with his former counterparts around the world just like every previous secretary of state.” “Like America’s closest allies,” the statement said, “he believes it is important that the nuclear agreement, which took the world years to negotiate, remain effective as countries focus on stability in the region.” It appears that whether Mr. Kerry violated the law is a matter of legal interpretation. Since the Iran deal is still in place — as of Monday — Mr. Kerry has not undermined or opposed American foreign policy, said Daniel Rice, a fellow at the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection at Georgetown University. “Because the Trump administration has not yet decided to reimpose sanctions on Iran, the existing nuclear deal framework — and not its repudiation — is currently a ‘measure of the United States,’” Mr. Rice said. “By attempting to salvage the deal, Kerry plainly did not intend to ‘defeat’ a measure of the United States.” But it also depends on exactly what Mr. Kerry said to the foreign officials, said Eric Posner, a law professor at the University of Chicago. “If he has gone further than merely expressing his opinion, and tried to influence the actions of foreign governments by, for example, making promises on behalf of a future Democratic president or Congress, and these promises are credible, there is an arguable Logan Act violation,” Mr. Posner said. The legal scholars interviewed by The Times all stressed that the law is a paper tiger that has never been seriously enforced. (Two said it may be unconstitutional.) Still, the Logan Act has occasionally resurfaced as a political cudgel. While it’s “perfectly plausible” to argue that Mr. Kerry violated the Logan Act, “it’s been violated hundreds of times” with no repercussions, said Michael McConnell, a law professor at Stanford University. Accused violators include Henry A. Wallace , the former vice president who lobbied against the Truman Doctrine; Jane Fonda , the actress who traveled to Hanoi during the Vietnam War; the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson , the civil rights activist who visited Cuba during a presidential campaign against Ronald Reagan; and 47 Republican senators who wrote to the government of Iran in 2015 to oppose the nuclear deal before it was struck. The law resurfaced again last year, when it was revealed that Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump’s first national security adviser, had discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador in late 2016 — before the president’s inauguration. And Mr. Trump himself may have committed the same offense as Mr. Kerry when, during the 2016 campaign, he invited Russia to hack Hillary Clinton’s emails , said Timothy Zick, a law professor at the College of William and Mary. (The suggestion of a Logan Act violation did emerge at the time .) But given that there have been no prosecutions under the Logan Act in its history, scholars said it’s hard to predict whether Mr. Kerry would be convicted — even if a case was brought against him. The Logan Act has “been a dead letter for hundreds of years,” Mr. McConnell said. “Its only function is mischief.” Advertisement"
"Trump will pull out of Iran nuclear deal, leading senator predicts","Sun 18 Mar 2018 16.01 GMT   Last modified on Thu 5 Jul 2018 21.46 BST   The chair of the Senate foreign relations committee has predicted Donald Trump will pull the US out of the nuclear deal with Iran . “The Iran deal will be another issue that’s coming up in May, and right now it doesn’t feel like it’s going to be extended,” Bob Corker told CBS’s Face the Nation in an interview broadcast on Sunday. “I think the president likely will move away from it, unless our European counterparts really come together on a framework. And it doesn’t feel to me that they are. Now, as we get within two weeks of the 12 May date, that could change.” Corker also said he did not think such a move would damage attempts to set up a meeting the same month between Trump and Kim Jong-un, the dictator of nuclear-armed North Korea. The Tennessee senator has clashed repeatedly with Trump and will retire in November. He has been touted in some quarters as a presidential rival in 2020 . In his CBS interview, he said: “This whole situation with North Korea … is somewhat unorthodox, and I think you’re dealing with a leader there that probably doesn’t think the same way that other countries and their leadership might. So I’m not sure that [ending the Iran deal] is gonna end up having a detrimental effect.” Trump has long opposed the 2015 deal, which curtails Tehran’s development of nuclear weapons in return for sanctions relief, partly because his predecessor in the White House, Barack Obama, regarded it as a signature achievement. This week Trump fired the secretary of state, Rex Tillerson , a defender of the deal, and nominated the CIA director, Mike Pompeo, to replace him. “I wanted to either break it or do something and he felt a little bit differently,” Trump told reporters. “So we were not really thinking the same. With Mike, Mike Pompeo, we have a very similar thought process.” Trump is also reported to be close to replacing the national security adviser, HR McMaster, another defender of the deal, with the former Bush UN ambassador John Bolton, a hawk who favours pre-emptive military action. Corker said he thought Pompeo had a good chance of being confirmed by his committee, even though Rand Paul of Kentucky has said he will vote no . Paul spoke to CNN’s State of the Union. “I don’t think you really want people who are eager for war to be running the state department,” he said. “You want a diplomat.” Pompeo, he said, was “too much of an advocate for regime change, really everywhere” and was not a “good fit to be a diplomat”. Paul is also opposed to the appointment of Gina Haspel as Pompeo’s successor at the CIA. He told CBS there was “no evidence [Haspel] was protesting against torture” when she oversaw “enhanced interrogation” under the Bush administration. “There’s every evidence she was covering it up ,” he said. Tillerson, Corker said, was “doing fine” despite reportedly having been fired in an undignified manner: the White House chief of staff, John Kelly, claimed Tillerson took a warning call from him while on the toilet, and Tillerson then learned of the final decision by tweet. Corker added that he thought Trump “likes to hear diverse opinions”. “But once a decision is made,” he said, “I think [Trump] likes to see it move along quickly. And I think that was one of the frustrations he may have had with Secretary Tillerson.”"
"Iran nuclear deal: negotiators announce 'framework' agreement","EU foreign policy chief and Iranian foreign minister hail ‘decisive step’ in Switzerland after 18 months of intensive bargaining  Julian Borger in Lausanne and  Paul Lewis in Washington  Fri 3 Apr 2015 00.46 BST   First published on Thu 2 Apr 2015 19.37 BST   Iran has promised to make drastic cuts to its nuclear programme in return for the gradual lifting of sanctions as part of a historic breakthrough in Lausanne that could end a 13-year nuclear standoff. The “political understanding”, announced on Thursday night in the Swiss city’s technical university, followed 18 months of intensive bargaining, culminating in an eight-day period of near-continuous talks that went on long into the night, and on the last night continued all the way through until dawn. In a joint statement, the European Union’s foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, and the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, hailed what they called a “decisive step” after more than a decade of work. Speaking afterwards, Zarif said the accord showed “our programme is exclusively peaceful, has always been and always will remain exclusively peaceful”, while not hindering the country’s pursuit of atomic energy for civilian purposes. Speaking at the White House, Barack Obama said that if fully implemented, the agreement would “cut off every pathway that Iran could take to develop a nuclear weapon”. As news of the deal reached Tehran, people took to the streets to celebrate, looking forward to the prospect of life without sanctions. In Washington, meanwhile, there was a clear sign of the battle to come over the agreement, which Republicans have vowed to overturn. Senator Mark Kirk, who is promoting fresh sanctions against Iran, declared that former British prime minister Neville Chamberlain “got a better deal from Adolf Hitler” at Munich. In his remarks in Lausanne, Kerry issued a riposte to rightwing critics of the accord. “Throughout history, diplomacy has been necessary to prevent wars and to define international boundaries, to design institutions, and to develop global norms,” Kerry said. “Simply demanding that Iran capitulate makes a nice soundbite, but it’s not a policy. It is not a realistic plan ... The test is whether or not it will leave the world safer or more secure than it would be without this agreement. And there can be no question that the comprehensive plan that we are moving toward will more than pass that test.” The US president is expected to face intense opposition on Capitol Hill, particularly from Republicans, who are determined to use their control of both chambers of the legislature to undermine an agreement they believe is soft on Tehran. Obama acknowledged there would be “a robust debate in the weeks and months to come” but insisted the agreement was both the most peaceful and effective method to ensure Iran does not obtain a nuclear weapon. “If we can get this done, and Iran follows through on the framework that our negotiators agreed to, we will be able to resolve one of the greatest threats to our security, and to do so peacefully.” The declaration of a framework deal is both preliminary and partial. It does not cover all the issues in dispute and is intended to be only a precursor to a full, comprehensive and detailed agreement due to be completed by the end of June. Before then, the understanding must survive attack from hardliners in Iran and the US. But the joint statement and the details published in Lausanne represent a set of basic compromises that had eluded negotiators for many years. Iran will cut its nuclear infrastructure to the point that western governments are satisfied it would take a year to “breakout” and build a bomb, if Tehran chose to follow that path. At the same time, Iran will open itself up to a level of monitoring and scrutiny of its nuclear programme that is likely to unparalleled anywhere in the world. When all that has been achieved, which could be in as little as six months, the overwhelming bulk of international sanctions would be lifted and Iran would re-enter the global economy. The accord also has the potential to be a turning point in normalising Iran’s adversarial relations with the west, which have been a constant in world affairs since the Islamic revolution of 1979. “This could be one of the most important diplomatic achievements in a generation or more,” said Ali Vaez, an Iran analyst at the International Crisis Group. The UK foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, said: “This is well beyond what many of us thought possible even 18 months ago.” Hammond said that Iran would face stringent monitoring of its programme. “There is a very rigorous transparency and inspection regime with access for international inspectors on a daily basis, high-tech surveillance of all the facilities, TV cameras, electronic seals on equipment, so we know remotely if any equipment has been moved,” he said. But Israel dismissed the deal, and said it would continue to prevent a “bad” final agreement. Strategic affairs minister Yuval Steinitz said in a statement after the announcements in Switzerland: “The smiles in Lausanne are detached from wretched reality in which Iran refuses to make any concessions on the nuclear issue and continues to threaten Israel and all other countries in the Middle East.” Obama spoke to Israel’s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, who told him that a final deal based on the agreement “would threaten the survival of Israel”. Among the main points of the understanding unveiled in Lausanne are: The first major test of the understanding will come in the next few days, when Kerry is expected to present the details to a closed session of the Senate foreign relations committee before a vote on a bill that would give Congress the power to accept or reject any nuclear agreement and another that would impose new sanctions. Zarif, Kerry’s opposite number at the talks, is expected to return to Tehran to a hero’s welcome from a public desperate to escape the shackles of sanctions, but he has frequently warned his fellow negotiators that he will face a backlash from hardliners opposed to dismantling any of Iran’s prized nuclear infrastructure. Kazem Sadjadpour, an Iranian university professor, said on state TV: “I feel very proud as an Iranian … This is a turning point in Iran’s history of diplomacy. This is a night of mourning for Netanyahu and his warmongering allies in the US congress.” The nuclear standoff with Iran has been a threat to global security and non-proliferation for well over a decade since a uranium enrichment plant at Natanz and a heavy water production plant at Arak were exposed in 2002 by an opposition group, probably using Israeli intelligence. Negotiations began in 2003 with European states in which Iran offered to limit its capacity to 3,000 centrifuges if its right to enrichment was recognised. The deal collapsed by 2005 and there was no sign of compromise for the next eight years, as the international community ratcheted up sanctions and Iran responded defiantly by expanding its nuclear programme, moving from production of low-enriched uranium to 20%-enriched uranium, a major step towards the capacity to make weapons-grade fissile material. The confrontation continued to escalate until 2013 and the election of a pragmatist president in Iran, Hassan Rouhani, who acted swiftly to establish lines of communication with the White House and between Kerry and Zarif. An interim deal was agreed in November 2013 that halted production of 20%-enriched uranium and eliminated Iran’s stockpile of the material in return for access to $700m a month of its assets frozen around the world. The interim deal, known as the joint plan of action, bought time for a comprehensive agreement which was initially intended to be completed by July last year. The negotiators gave themselves another four months until November, and then after marathon talks in Vienna, it was postponed again, setting 30 June as the new deadline."
"The Iran Nuclear Deal: What You Need to Know","Advertisement Supported by By  The New York Times The nuclear accord announced by Iran, the United States and five other world powers on Thursday was surprisingly specific and placed limits on Tehran’s nuclear program for the next 15 years. Its central achievement was to reduce Iran’s existing stockpile of nuclear fuel and its capacity to produce new fuel to a level that would ensure it would take at least a year for Iran to manufacture enough fuel for an atomic weapon if it chose to violate the accord. It took two years of negotiations, capped by eight tumultuous days and nights of talks that appeared on the brink of breakdown several times. Negotiators produced a framework for a comprehensive agreement that parties say they intend to draft by June 30. If that final deal is reached and signed, it will be the most significant accord between Iran and major world powers since its Islamic revolution in 1979. • Is allowed to keep its nuclear facilities, which it insists are for civilian uses only, but they would be subject to strict production limits. Two facilities will be converted into research sites without fissile material. • Cuts the number of its centrifuges, which are used to enrich uranium, by two-thirds to 5,060, and reduces its stockpile of low-enriched uranium from 10,000 kilograms to 300 kilograms — not enough for a nuclear weapon — for 15 years. Thousands of centrifuges will be put into storage. A guide to help you navigate the deal between global powers and Tehran. • Agrees to redesign a heavy-water reactor at Arak in a way that would keep it from producing plutonium, a weapons-usable fuel. • Gets relief from a range of international sanctions that have sharply reduced its sale of oil and impeded access to the international financial system. Negotiations over research and development of more advanced centrifuges were particularly difficult. The Iranians won the right to research, but not to use more modern machines for production for the next 10 years. • The timing of sanctions relief. Iran wants all sanctions removed quickly. The United States says sanctions would be removed in stages after Iran shows compliance with the terms of a final nuclear agreement. • The Americans want all nuclear facilities “anywhere in the country,” including military bases, to be subject to inspections that could “investigate suspicious sites or allegations of a covert enrichment facility.” • The process for ensuring Iran remains in compliance with the terms of the agreement and the process for reimposing sanctions if its is found to fall out of compliance. • The details of how Iran’s existing stockpile of nuclear fuel would be diluted, neutralized or removed from the country. American officials say even if Iran breaks the deal, it would not be able to develop enough material for a nuclear weapon for a year, giving the international community time to respond. President Obama insisted that the deal “cuts off every pathway” for Iran to develop a nuclear weapon and establishes the most intrusive inspection system in history. “If Iran cheats,” he said, “the world will know it.” Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, who won the 2013 election promising to mend the country’s ties with the rest of the world , said on Twitter that he had congratulated his foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, and the rest of the negotiating team for their “tireless efforts around the clock.” There was no immediate reaction from Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who in recent weeks has emphasized that all Iranians should support the negotiations. There was huge demand within Iran for an end to Western sanctions on the oil and banking sectors. There were celebrations on the streets in some parts of Tehran on Thursday night. But Iranian negotiators will have to overcome significant political objections from hard-liners, the military and scientific establishments. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, the world’s most vocal critic of the emerging agreement, demanded on Friday that Iran recognize his country’s right to exist as part of a deal. He continues to argue that a deal poses a grave danger to the region and the world. Many leaders in Arab countries also oppose the deal, which comes amid tensions over Iran’s involvement in Yemen, Syria, Iraq and Lebanon. Mr. Obama called King Salman of Saudi Arabia on Friday to reassure the United States’ longtime ally that he remains concerned about “Iran’s destabilizing activities in the region,” and invited the king and other Gulf leaders to Camp David in the spring. Mr. Obama will have a hard time convincing a skeptical Congress, where Republicans and many Democrats are deeply concerned that he has grown so desperate to reach a deal that he is trading away American and Israeli security. He warned Republicans in Congress that if they tried to impose new sanctions to undermine the effort, the United States would be blamed for a diplomatic failure. But if a final agreement is reached, it could reorder America’s relationship with a country that has been an avowed adversary for 36 years, and would define the president’s foreign policy legacy.

"Barack Obama says historic agreement with Iran meets core objectives","Sabrina Siddiqui in New York and  Paul Lewis in Washington  Fri 3 Apr 2015 08.20 BST   First published on Thu 2 Apr 2015 22.10 BST   Barack Obama has praised a “historic agreement” over Iran’s nuclear programme, shortly after a tentative framework was announced that would lift international sanctions on Iran in exchange for new limits on Iran’s nuclear capabilities. In remarks delivered from the Rose Garden at the White House, a defiant Obama characterised the deal as “the best option so far” to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. But Israel’s prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu was fiercely critical, telling Obama that his country “vehemently opposes” the deal. “This has been a long time coming,” Obama said. “It is a good deal, a deal that meets our core objectives … If this framework leads to a final, comprehensive deal, it will make our country, our allies and our world safer.” The framework, the culmination of marathon talks between world leaders in Lausanne, provides the basis for a more comprehensive nuclear agreement that is to be reached by 30 June. Obama acknowledged the work was far from complete and that there would be “a robust debate in the weeks and months to come”. But he emphasised the need to resolve the matter through diplomacy, and said that pulling out now would risk another military conflict in the Middle East. “If we can get this done, and Iran follows through on the framework that our negotiators agreed to, we will be able to resolve one of the greatest threats to our security, and to do so peacefully,” Obama said. Under the tentative agreement, restrictions will be placed on Iran’s enrichment of nuclear material so that it cannot lead to atomic weapons. In return, the US and European Union will terminate all nuclear-related economic sanctions on Iran once the UN nuclear agency confirms that Iran has complied. The White House said Obama spoke separately on Wednesday with François Hollande, Angela Merkel and David Cameron to discuss the framework. The leaders agreed that while nothing is final, the framework represents “significant progress”, the White House said. Back home, Obama faces mounting opposition from lawmakers on Capitol Hill, particularly Republicans who control both chambers of Congress. In recent months, the GOP has sought to undermine the talks while positioning itself as a close ally of Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu – who has been at loggerheads with Obama over US efforts to secure a nuclear deal with Iran’s. Obama phoned Netanyahu on Thursday to discuss the nuclear agreement, according to the White House. In a statement, a spokesperson said that the Obama emphasised that the US “remains steadfast in [its] commitment to the security of Israel .” Netanyahu told Obama that Israel “vehemently opposes” the framework deal . In a statement released after his conversation with the US president he said: “A deal that is based on this framework will threaten Israel’s existence ... The alternative is to stand firmly and increase pressure on Iran until a better deal is reached.” The Israeli PM is convening senior ministers on Friday to discuss the deal. During his speech, Obama took a thinly veiled shot at Republicans over a letter 47 of their senators sent to the Iranian leadership warning that any deal could be overturned by Congress or a future president. “This is not simply a deal between my administration and Iran,” Obama said. “The issues at stake are bigger than politics,” Obama said. “These are matters of war and peace.” Obama also addressed criticism that concessions have largely been one-sided, favouring only Iran. “Iran is not going to simply dismantle its programme because we demand it to do so. That’s not how the world works, and that’s not what history shows us,” Obama said, adding that if the US rejected what “the majority of the world considers a fair deal”, it would be doubtful that the country could even keep in place its current international sanctions. In a further nod to his sceptics, Obama pointed out that Iran will face “the most robust and intrusive inspections and transparency regime ever negotiated for any nuclear programme in history”. “If Iran cheats, the world will know it,” he said. “This deal is not based on trust. It’s based on unprecedented verification.” Amid criticism that his administration has not adequately engaged US lawmakers on the negotiations, Obama said he planned to speak with congressional leaders and would welcome cooperation from Congress. But he implored legislators to act in the interest of national security, and not politics. “If Congress kills this deal, not based on expert analysis and without offering any reasonable alternative, then it is the United States that will be blamed for the failure of diplomacy,” Obama said. “International unity will collapse and the path to conflict will widen.” Republicans showed little interest in heeding Obama’s call, offering swift criticism of the framework and signalling a battle ahead. “The parameters for a final deal represent an alarming departure from the White House’s initial goals,” John Boehner , the House speaker, said in a statement. “My longtime concerns about the parameters of this potential agreement remain, but my immediate concern is the administration signalling it will provide near-term sanctions relief. Congress must be allowed to fully review the details of any agreement before any sanctions are lifted.” Boehner, who recently led a GOP delegation to the Middle East to meet with allies in the region, added that “it would be naive to suggest the Iranian regime will not continue to use its nuclear programme, and any economic relief, to further destabilise the region.” Democrats also remained circumspect of the deal but reserved judgment pending further review of the details. Harry Reid, the Senate Democratic leader, said he had spoken with Obama and was “cautiously optimistic” about the framework. “We must always remain vigilant about preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon but there is no question that a diplomatic solution is vastly preferable to the alternatives,” Reid said in a statement. “Now is the time for thoughtful consideration, not rash action that could undermine the prospects for success.”"
"Theresa May faces Israeli pressure over Iran nuclear deal","PM tells Benjamin Netanyahu that Britain still backs deal, and raises issue of Palestinian deaths  Patrick Wintour Diplomatic editor and agencies  Wed 6 Jun 2018 16.04 BST   Last modified on Fri 8 Jun 2018 13.48 BST   Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu , has pressed Theresa May to recognise that the Iranian nuclear deal is on the point of collapse and that a fresh plan is needed to stop Iran restarting its uranium enrichment programme. Netanyahu met May on Wednesday following his talks this week with the other European supporters of the landmark 2015 nuclear deal, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and Germany’s chancellor, Angela Merkel. Netanyahu has lobbied for European leaders to follow the example of the US president, Donald Trump , and pull out of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) on Iran. “Along with France and Germany, the UK continues to believe [the JCPOA] is the best route to preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon,” May said. “We will remain committed to it as long as Iran meets its obligations. But we do recognise that there are other issues that need to be addressed in relation to Iran – its destabilising regional activity in countries like Syria and Yemen and also the proliferation of ballistic missiles.” Netanyahu told May he was focused on making sure Iran did not get a nuclear weapon and on “how to roll back Iran’s aggression in the region”. The European signatories are scrambling to save the accord, which they see as crucial to forestalling an Iranian nuclear weapon. However, the US president has said the deal is deeply flawed. The Israeli pressure is designed not only to back Trump’s decision to pull out of the deal but also to force European firms to disinvest from Iran. May also raised the subject of the UN’s call for an independent inquiry into the killing of dozens of Palestinian protesters on the day the US moved its embassy to Jerusalem . May stressed she recognised Israel’s right to self-defence but called on Netanyahu to act to alleviate the situation. The Israeli prime minister insisted the protests were driven by the militant group Hamas and that the response was aimed at minimising causalities. Rival groups of protesters gathered outside Downing Street waving Palestinian and Israeli flags before Netanyahu’s arrival. On Tuesday, Iran said it had ordered preparations for increasing uranium enrichment capacity in case the nuclear agreement collapsed. It also announced it had completed a new centrifuge assembly centre at the Natanz nuclear site. The French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, said the move stopped short of breaching the terms of the nuclear deal, but came close to crossing the red line. “This initiative is unwelcome. It shows a sort of irritation,” he told Europe 1 radio. “It is always dangerous to flirt with the red lines, but the initiative taken … remains totally within the framework of the Vienna [nuclear] deal.” The finance ministers and foreign secretaries of the UK, Germany and France have jointly written to their US counterparts seeking assurances that the US will not impose secondary sanctions on EU firms operating in Iran. Their letter says that JCPOA is “the best means through which we can prevent a nuclear armed Iran”. Speaking in France ahead of his meeting with May, Netanyahu was confident that the EU firms operating in Iran would not be able to resist US sanctions. “I didn’t ask France to withdraw from JCPOA because I think it will be dissolved by weight of economic forces. My interest is not this or that agreement but to make sure Iran does not have nuclear weapons, and the last thing anyone wants is to have this theocratic dictatorship [with] a nuclear arsenal,” he said. Several big companies, including France’s Total and the Netherlands’ Maersk, have already said it would be impossible to stay in Iran once sanctions were fully reimposed over the next six months, unless they received explicit exemptions from Washington. Boeing also announced it was cancelling plans to provide two Iranian carriers. The European Investment Bank said on Wednesday that it could not help shield trade between the EU and Iran from US sanctions, dashing the hopes of some EU finance ministers that it might be a source of finance for EU firms operating in Iran. The bank said it “should remain a solid and credible institution on the international capital markets, and this would be incompatible with ignoring possible sanctions against Iran”."
"Iran Rallies Against U.S. and Warns Europe Over Endangered Nuclear Deal","Advertisement Supported by By  Thomas Erdbrink and Rick Gladstone TEHRAN — Iran’s hard-line authorities organized nationwide rallies on Friday to denounce the Trump administration’s withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear agreement, burning American flags and warning that Europe might further sabotage the accord. The reaction reflected the view held by many hard-liners that the American withdrawal had vindicated their suspicions that Westerners were treacherous. The anger on display in Tehran and other cities also reinforced the possibility that Iran would now abandon the agreement as well, restarting the nuclear-fuel enrichment that it had halted. Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami, a well-known hard-liner who leads the Friday Prayer services in Tehran, admonished fellow citizens against making any deals with foreigners “since they cannot be trusted.” In his sermon, broadcast on state television, Ayatollah Khatami also criticized Iranian politicians who have looked toward Europe to preserve the nuclear agreement, arguing that the Europeans, too, have broken promises. The outpouring of anger, in demonstrations organized around the country, was the most strident so far to President Trump’s announcement on Tuesday that he was abandoning the nuclear agreement reached with Iran and other major powers three years ago. The agreement relaxed or ended many economic restrictions on Iran in return for its verifiable pledges to never make nuclear weapons, including a freeze on nuclear fuel production for at least 15 years. Mr. Trump called the agreement too weak and described it as a shameful giveaway to Iran by his predecessor, Barack Obama. Mr. Trump’s announcement restored onerous American sanctions on Iran, including penalties for foreign companies that do business with that country. His announcement was widely criticized around the world but drew praise from Iran’s regional enemies, Israel and Saudi Arabia. While European governments have said they want to preserve the accord, the participation of the United States was widely considered to be crucial to its survival. Even before Mr. Trump announced the pullout, non-American businesses were wary about making any financial commitments in Iran, fearful of such an outcome. Many Iranians, who had hoped the nuclear accord would bring a flood of investment and business to the country of 80 million, have been deeply disappointed. Reminding Iranians of this point, Ayatollah Khatami said Europeans had been expected to invest in Iran after the nuclear agreement took effect but most never did. He exhorted listeners to shout “Death to America!” and “Death to Israel!” In response to what Israel has described as its aerial assaults on Iranian bases in Syria, Ayatollah Khatami also said that Iran would “rob the Israeli regime of sleep” and threatened to “raze Tel Aviv and Haifa to the ground.” The American withdrawal from the nuclear accord is considered a serious political blow to Hassan Rouhani, Iran’s president, who had promised that the agreement would end the country’s prolonged isolation and economic travails. The withdrawal also reinforced the anti-American hostility of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, who reluctantly had gone along with Mr. Rouhani and his nuclear negotiators. The mood at Friday Prayer services was defiant in Tehran, where men burned American flags. One worshiper, Hassan Khedri, 24, with spiky hair and a sleeveless shirt, said: “I am an Iranian Kurd and I am ready to fight with America and Israel. I only wait for the command of the chief commander, our Supreme Leader Khamenei.” Another worshiper, Hasan Biagi, 65, said the threat to the nuclear agreement caused by the American pullout showed the true faces of Iran’s enemies. “We cannot even rely on Europe,” he said. “This is a big lesson for us. Never trust the West.” The mistrust was an underlying theme in a statement issued by the government on Thursday denouncing what it called Mr. Trump’s “new extremist administration” for exiting the agreement. “Mr. Trump’s absurd insults against the great Iranian nation indicate the extent of his ignorance and folly,” the statement said. Warning the agreement’s European participants — Britain, France and Germany — the statement said they “must take the necessary action to safeguard the accord and to implement their commitments — which they proved incapable of fully performing even while the U.S. was nominally a party to the deal.” Ayatollah Khamenei also expressed skepticism about whether the Europeans would keep their word. In a speech on Wednesday to teachers in Tehran, he hinted that the nuclear agreement would fail. “I do not trust these three countries either,” he said. “Do not trust them. If you want to sign a contract, ask for actual guarantees. I swear to God, they will do the same thing that the Americans did.” Resentment and resistance toward Mr. Trump’s decision also appeared to be deepening in Europe, where many officials view it as an arrogant act that could force European companies to acquiesce to American policy toward Iran. “Do we want the United States to be the world’s economic gendarme?” Bruno Le Maire, France’s minister of economy and finances, said on the Europe 1 radio station. “Or do we Europeans want to say: ‘We have economic interests, we want to continue trading with Iran within the framework of a strategic agreement. We believe that this is the right approach, so we will continue.’” Even so, there were new signs on Friday that some big non-American companies were heeding the White House’s warning to wind down commercial commitments in Tehran. The Treasury Department, which oversees American sanctions policy, has given businesses 90 to 180 days before it starts enforcing penalties. Two leading shipping companies, Maersk Line and MSC, said they were reviewing their Iran operations, and Indonesia’s state energy company, Pertamina, said it might delay a contract to operate Iran’s Mansouri oil field, Reuters reported. The American restoration of sanctions also annulled the export licenses of leading aerospace companies to sell commercial aircraft to Iran, upending multibillion-dollar orders won by Boeing and Airbus. Boeing has played down the fallout , saying it had not committed to any production for Iran. Airbus, which has already delivered a few aircraft to Iran, has not specified what it will do. Although Airbus is a European company, it needs an American export license because Airbus planes contain some American components. “We’re carefully analyzing the president’s announcement and will be evaluating next steps consistent with our internal policies and in full compliance with U.S. sanctions and export control regulations,” Airbus said in an emailed statement. “That analysis could take a bit of time.” Thomas Erdbrink reported from Tehran, and Rick Gladstone from New York.

"Iran nuclear deal: world powers reach historic agreement to lift sanctions","Obama vows to veto any Republican attempt to undermine deal as Iran hails ‘win-win solution’  Julian Borger in Vienna  Tue 14 Jul 2015 13.54 BST   First published on Tue 14 Jul 2015 12.00 BST   Iran and six world powers have concluded an agreement that will lift sanctions on Iran but place strict limits on its nuclear programme for more than a decade, in a historic compromise designed to stop the spread of atomic weapons and avert a major new conflict in the Middle East. The deal, concluded in a Vienna hotel after prolonged talks between foreign ministers, binds Iran, the US, UK, France, Germany, Russia and China to a series of undertakings stretching over many years. Iran will dismantle much of its nuclear infrastructure, while the UN, US and EU will take down a wall of sanctions built around Iran over the past nine years. Barack Obama said the agreement was the best available option to prevent Tehran from acquiring a nuclear bomb, and promised to veto any attempt by Republican opponents to undermine it . His Iranian counterpart, Hassan Rouhani, said a new phase had begun in Iran’s relations with the rest of the world. Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Washington-based Arms Control Association, described the agreement as among the most complex and consequential of the nuclear age: “[The agreement follows] nearly two years of intense negotiations involving seven nations, including two long-time adversaries, after more than a decade of false starts and missed opportunities. “The deal is a major nuclear nonproliferation breakthrough that promises to prevent the emergence of another nuclear-armed state and head off a nuclear arms race in the world’s most volatile region.” Among the conditions of the agreement are: Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, who has been leading his country’s delegation in Vienna, described the agreement as a “win-win” solution but not perfect. “I believe this is a historic moment,” he said. “We are reaching an agreement that is not perfect for anybody but is what we could accomplish. Today could have been the end of hope, but now we are starting a new chapter of hope.” Federica Mogherini, the EU’s foreign policy chief, said the agreement would “open the way to a new chapter in international relations” and show that diplomacy can overcome decades of tension. “This is a sign of hope for the entire world,” she said. Israel’s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, who has faced mounting criticism at home over his handling of the diplomacy around Iran, moved pre-emptively to denounce the deal even before the details had emerged. Heading a chorus of condemnation from Israeli politicians – including many members of his rightwing coalition – he said the agreement was a capitulation and a mistake of historic proportions. The deal was also denounced by the hardline former foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman as “a total surrender to terror”. Yair Lapid, head of the Yesh Atid party, said Netanyahu’s campaign over Iran had been a “colossal failure”. Later this month, the UN security council will pass a resolution incorporating the agreement and its five annexes as an attachment, but it will be 90 days before it enters into force, to allow for it to be reviewed domestically in the US and Iran. At that point, Iran will carry out its part of the bargain, dismantling nuclear infrastructure. Western officials say that might take several months, but a senior Iranian official said his government was ready to act much faster. “We think that in a matter of weeks not months we will be able to finish what we have committed to,” the official said. A trial by fire under the highly sceptical scrutiny of the US Congress will be the biggest challenge to the deal’s survival. The deal will enter a period of limbo for up to 82 days: 60 for Congress to review it and a further 22 for a first vote and possibly a second in the event of a presidential veto. On Tuesday Obama promised to use his veto on any domestic attempts to undermine the deal. “I am confident that this deal will meet the national security needs of the United States and our allies, so I will veto any legislation that prevents the successful implementation of this deal,” he said. “We do not have to accept an inevitable spiral into conflict, and we certainly shouldn’t seek it.” The president said the agreement was not based on trust with Tehran, which he acknowledged is a longtime enemy of the United States, but rather “built on verification”. He added: “This deal meets every single one of the bottom lines we established when we achieved a framework earlier this spring. Every pathway to a nuclear weapon is cut off. And the inspection and transparency regime necessary to verify that objective will be put in place.” Iran’s Majlis will also take time to debate the deal, but without a fixed timetable. Only if and when the agreement survives both processes will it start to be implemented. Iran will start dismantling centrifuges, shipping out or converting its stockpile of low enriched uranium (LEU), removing the core from its heavy water reactor in Arak and start intensive work with the International Atomic Energy Agency on resolving unanswered questions about possible past work on nuclear weapons design. At the same time, Obama will issue presidential waivers suspending US economic and financial sanctions, and the EU will vote to lift its oil embargo and banking sanctions. The UN resolution would lift six layers of international sanctions, except for an arms embargo and restrictions on missile technology. None of the sanctions relief measures will take immediate effect, but will be conditional on the IAEA verifying that Iran has carried out all its promised steps. The aim is to have this done by the end of the year. At that point, $100bn in Iranian assets around the world will be unfrozen. Ordinary Iranians, however, will have to wait several months before feeling the economic benefits. Rouhani will hope the influx of money into the ailing economy will come in time for the voters to reward reformists at the parliamentary elections in 2016, and help further change the country’s course. “Today is an end and a beginning … an end to baseless claims and a beginning for a new phase in international relations,” he said on Tuesday. “Today we are at an important juncture in the history of our country and revolution. A new chapter has begun … it shows problems in the world can be solved through less costly ways.” A preliminary outline of the deal was agreed in principle in Lausanne in April , but it left many of the details unresolved and Iran’s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, said his country would only recognise a full and comprehensive agreement. Iran has also pledged to cooperate with an IAEA investigation into evidence of past experiments in nuclear weapons design, mostly dating back over 12 years. The agency’s director general, Yukiya Amano, signed an understanding with Iran’s nuclear chief, Ali Akbar Salehi, on Tuesday morning, in which both undertook to complete the investigation by the end of the year. The IAEA has not committed itself to coming to definite conclusions in that period. It describes the agreement as a “road map” that Amano said “provides for technical expert meetings, technical measures and discussions”. A separate arrangement would be agreed for the IAEA to visit a particularly controversial site, a military base called Parchin. Within a few months, the IAEA verification that Iran has shrunk its nuclear programme will trigger the third phase of the agreement, in which multiple layers of economic and financial sanctions are lifted, and about $100bn in Iranian assets abroad will be unfrozen. There are still many things that can go wrong. The deal could be repudiated by the US Congress with enough Democratic defectors to override a presidential veto. That domestic battle will draw in America’s allies on either side. Netanyahu’s Israeli government is lobbying heavily for the deal to be rejected, as are the Gulf Arab monarchies. The western Europeans will try to counter their influence on US public opinion and Congress. The agreement could also fall apart over the question of Iranian cooperation with the IAEA inquiry into past weaponisation studies, or stumble over a disagreement over whether IAEA inspectors can enter a site run by the Iran’s Revolutionary Guard. But the deal’s supporters believe that if it can survive, the agreement has the potential to redraw Iran’s relations with the US, dampen the likelihood for another war in the Middle East and set a new standard for negotiated non-proliferation, stopping the spread of nuclear weapons in the Middle East and beyond."
"Text and Video: Obama’s Address on the Iran Nuclear Deal","Advertisement Supported by Today, after two years of negotiations, the United States, together with our international partners, has achieved something that decades of animosity has not — a comprehensive, long-term deal with Iran that will prevent it from obtaining a nuclear weapon. This deal demonstrates that American diplomacy can bring about real and meaningful change — change that makes our country, and the world, safer and more secure. This deal is also in line with a tradition of American leadership. It’s now more than 50 years since President Kennedy stood before the American people and said, “Let us never negotiate out of fear, but let us never fear to negotiate.” He was speaking then about the need for discussions between the United States and the Soviet Union, which led to efforts to restrict the spread of nuclear weapons. In those days, the risk was a catastrophic nuclear war between two super powers. In our time, the risk is that nuclear weapons will spread to more and more countries, particularly in the Middle East, the most volatile region in our world. Today, because America negotiated from a position of strength and principle, we have stopped the spread of nuclear weapons in this region. Because of this deal, the international community will be able to verify that the Islamic Republic of Iran will not develop a nuclear weapon. This deal meets every single one of the bottom lines that we established when we achieved a framework earlier this spring. Every pathway to a nuclear weapon is cut off. And the inspection and transparency regime necessary to verify that objective will be put in place. Because of this deal, Iran will not produce the highly enriched uranium and weapons-grade plutonium that form the raw materials necessary for a nuclear bomb. Because of this deal, Iran will remove two-thirds of its installed centrifuges — the machines necessary to produce highly enriched uranium for a bomb — and store them under constant international supervision. Iran will not use its advanced centrifuges to produce enriched uranium for the next decade. Iran will also get rid of 98 percent of its stockpile of enriched uranium. To put that in perspective, Iran currently has a stockpile that could produce up to 10 nuclear weapons. Because of this deal, that stockpile will be reduced to a fraction of what would be required for a single weapon. This stockpile limitation will last for 15 years. Because of this deal, Iran will modify the core of its reactor in Arak so that it will not produce weapons-grade plutonium. And it has agreed to ship the spent fuel from the reactor out of the country for the lifetime of the reactor. For at least the next 15 years, Iran will not build any new heavy-water reactors. Because of this deal, we will, for the first time, be in a position to verify all of these commitments. That means this deal is not built on trust; it is built on verification. Inspectors will have 24/7 access to Iran’s key nuclear facilities. Iran [Inspectors] will have access to Iran’s entire nuclear supply chain — its uranium mines and mills, its conversion facility, and its centrifuge manufacturing and storage facilities. This ensures that Iran will not be able to divert materials from known facilities to covert ones. Some of these transparency measures will be in place for 25 years. Because of this deal, inspectors will also be able to access any suspicious location. Put simply, the organization responsible for the inspections, the I.A.E.A., will have access where necessary, when necessary. That arrangement is permanent. And the I.A.E.A. has also reached an agreement with Iran to get access that it needs to complete its investigation into the possible military dimensions of Iran’s past nuclear research. Finally, Iran is permanently prohibited from pursuing a nuclear weapon under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which provided the basis for the international community’s efforts to apply pressure on Iran. As Iran takes steps to implement this deal, it will receive relief from the sanctions that we put in place because of Iran’s nuclear program — both America’s own sanctions and sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council. This relief will be phased in. Iran must complete key nuclear steps before it begins to receive new sanctions relief. And over the course of the next decade, Iran must abide by the deal before additional sanctions are lifted, including five years for restrictions related to arms, and eight years for restrictions related to ballistic missiles. All of this will be memorialized and endorsed in a new United Nations Security Council resolution. And if Iran violates the deal, all of these sanctions will snap back into place. So there’s a very clear incentive for Iran to follow through, and there are very real consequences for a violation. That’s the deal. It has the full backing of the international community. Congress will now have an opportunity to review the details, and my administration stands ready to provide extensive briefings on how this will move forward. As the American people and Congress review the deal, it will be important to consider the alternative. Consider what happens in a world without this deal. Without this deal, there is no scenario where the world joins us in sanctioning Iran until it completely dismantles its nuclear program. Nothing we know about the Iranian government suggests that it would simply capitulate under that kind of pressure. And the world would not support an effort to permanently sanction Iran into submission. We put sanctions in place to get a diplomatic resolution, and that is what we have done. Without this deal, there would be no agreed-upon limitations for the Iranian nuclear program. Iran could produce, operate and test more and more centrifuges. Iran could fuel a reactor capable of producing plutonium for a bomb. And we would not have any of the inspections that allow us to detect a covert nuclear weapons program. In other words, no deal means no lasting constraints on Iran’s nuclear program. Such a scenario would make it more likely that other countries in the region would feel compelled to pursue their own nuclear programs, threatening a nuclear arms race in the most volatile region of the world. It would also present the United States with fewer and less effective options to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. I’ve been president and commander in chief for over six years now. Time and again, I have faced decisions about whether or not to use military force. It’s the gravest decision that any president has to make. Many times, in multiple countries, I have decided to use force. And I will never hesitate to do so when it is in our national security interest. I strongly believe that our national security interest now depends upon preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon — which means that without a diplomatic resolution, either I or a future U.S. president would face a decision about whether or not to allow Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon or whether to use our military to stop it. Put simply, no deal means a greater chance of more war in the Middle East. Moreover, we give nothing up by testing whether or not this problem can be solved peacefully. If, in a worst-case scenario, Iran violates the deal, the same options that are available to me today will be available to any U.S. president in the future. And I have no doubt that 10 or 15 years from now, the person who holds this office will be in a far stronger position with Iran further away from a weapon and with the inspections and transparency that allow us to monitor the Iranian program. For this reason, I believe it would be irresponsible to walk away from this deal. But on such a tough issue, it is important that the American people and their representatives in Congress get a full opportunity to review the deal. After all, the details matter. And we’ve had some of the finest nuclear scientists in the world working through those details. And we’re dealing with a country — Iran — that has been a sworn adversary of the United States for over 35 years. So I welcome a robust debate in Congress on this issue, and I welcome scrutiny of the details of this agreement. But I will remind Congress that you don’t make deals like this with your friends. We negotiated arms control agreements with the Soviet Union when that nation was committed to our destruction. And those agreements ultimately made us safer. I am confident that this deal will meet the national security interest of the United States and our allies. So I will veto any legislation that prevents the successful implementation of this deal. We do not have to accept an inevitable spiral into conflict. And we certainly shouldn’t seek it. And precisely because the stakes are so high, this is not the time for politics or posturing. Tough talk from Washington does not solve problems. Hard-nosed diplomacy, leadership that has united the world’s major powers offers a more effective way to verify that Iran is not pursuing a nuclear weapon. Now, that doesn’t mean that this deal will resolve all of our differences with Iran. We share the concerns expressed by many of our friends in the Middle East, including Israel and the Gulf states, about Iran’s support for terrorism and its use of proxies to destabilize the region. But that is precisely why we are taking this step — because an Iran armed with a nuclear weapon would be far more destabilizing and far more dangerous to our friends and to the world. Meanwhile, we will maintain our own sanctions related to Iran’s support for terrorism, its ballistic missile program, and its human rights violations. We will continue our unprecedented efforts to strengthen Israel’s security — efforts that go beyond what any American administration has done before. And we will continue the work we began at Camp David to elevate our partnership with the Gulf States to strengthen their capabilities to counter threats from Iran or terrorist groups like ISIL. However, I believe that we must continue to test whether or not this region, which has known so much suffering, so much bloodshed, can move in a different direction. Time and again, I have made clear to the Iranian people that we will always be open to engagement on the basis of mutual interests and mutual respect. Our differences are real and the difficult history between our nations cannot be ignored. But it is possible to change. The path of violence and rigid ideology, a foreign policy based on threats to attack your neighbors or eradicate Israel — that’s a dead end. A different path, one of tolerance and peaceful resolution of conflict, leads to more integration into the global economy, more engagement with the international community, and the ability of the Iranian people to prosper and thrive. This deal offers an opportunity to move in a new direction. We should seize it. We have come a long way to reach this point — decades of an Iranian nuclear program, many years of sanctions, and many months of intense negotiation. Today, I want to thank the members of Congress from both parties who helped us put in place the sanctions that have proven so effective, as well as the other countries who joined us in that effort. I want to thank our negotiating partners — the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia, China, as well as the European Union — for our unity in this effort, which showed that the world can do remarkable things when we share a vision of peacefully addressing conflicts. We showed what we can do when we do not split apart. And finally, I want to thank the American negotiating team. We had a team of experts working for several weeks straight on this, including our energy secretarynergy, Ernie Moniz. And I want to particularly thank John Kerry, our secretary of state, who began his service to this country more than four decades ago when he put on our uniform and went off to war. He’s now making this country safer through his commitment to strong, principled American diplomacy. History shows that America must lead not just with our might, but with our principles. It shows we are stronger not when we are alone, but when we bring the world together. Today’s announcement marks one more chapter in this pursuit of a safer and more helpful and more hopeful world. Thank you. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. Advertisement"
"Iran Agrees to Detailed Nuclear Outline, First Step Toward a Wider Deal","Advertisement Supported by By  Michael R. Gordon and David E. Sanger LAUSANNE, Switzerland — Iran and the United States, along with five other world powers, announced on Thursday a surprisingly specific and comprehensive understanding on limiting Tehran’s nuclear program for the next 15 years, though they left several specific issues to a final agreement in June. After two years of negotiations, capped by eight tumultuous days and nights of talks that appeared on the brink of breakdown several times, Secretary of State John Kerry and his Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif, announced the plan, which, if carried out, would keep Iran’s nuclear facilities open under strict production limits, and which holds the potential of reordering America’s relationship with a country that has been an avowed adversary for 35 years. Mr. Kerry and Energy Secretary Ernest J. Moniz, a nuclear scientist who played a crucial role in the last stages of the negotiations, said the pact satisfied their primary goal of ensuring that Iran, if it decided to, could not race for a nuclear weapon in less than a year, although those constraints against “breakout” would be in effect only for the first decade of the accord. President Obama, for whom remaking the American relationship with Iran has been a central objective since his 2008 campaign, stepped into the Rose Garden moments later to celebrate what he called “a historic understanding with Iran.” He warned Republicans in Congress that if they tried to impose new sanctions to undermine the effort, the United States would be blamed for a diplomatic failure. He insisted that the deal “cuts off every pathway” for Iran to develop a nuclear weapon and establishes the most intrusive inspection system in history. “If Iran cheats,” he said, “the world will know it.” Under the accord, Iran agreed to cut the number of operating centrifuges it has by two-thirds, to 5,060, all of them first-generation, and to cut its current stockpile of low-enriched uranium from around 10,000 kilograms to 300 for 15 years. An American description of the deal also referred to inspections “anywhere in the country” that could “investigate suspicious sites or allegations of a covert enrichment facility.” But in a briefing, American officials talked about setting up a mechanism to resolve disputes that has not been explained in any detail. In a move not seen since before the Iranian revolution in 1979, and to the surprise of many in both countries, Iranian government broadcasters aired Mr. Obama’s comments live. In parts of Tehran, people cheered and honked car horns as they began to contemplate a life without sanctions on oil and financial transactions, though the issue of when the sanctions are to be removed looms as one of the potential obstacles to a final agreement on June 30. If that hurdle and the problem of ridding Iran of its huge nuclear fuel stockpile can be fully resolved in the next three months, the preliminary accord will still need to be sold to Iran’s neighbors. The prospect of a deal has inflamed Israel and the Gulf states, alarmed by Iranian muscle-flexing in the Middle East, most recently in Iraq, Syria and Yemen. There is so much concern that Mr. Obama, in a phone call today to King Salman of Saudi Arabia, invited Arab leaders to Camp David this spring to discuss Iran and the turmoil in the region. Analysts have long been worried that Saudi Arabia and other Arab states might mount their own nuclear programs if they decide that Iran is being allowed to retain too much of its nuclear infrastructure. In a telephone call from Air Force One on Thursday afternoon, Mr. Obama told Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, that while the deal was not final, it “represents significant progress towards a lasting, comprehensive solution that cuts off all of Iran’s pathways to a bomb and verifiably ensures the peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear program going forward,” according to an account of the conversation from the White House. Mr. Netanyahu, a strong critic of the deal, was apparently not mollified, and released a statement saying, “A deal based on this framework would threaten the survival of Israel.” Mr. Zarif, for his part, was careful to play down the notion that anything agreed to here would remake the relationship. Any hint of a broader rapprochement is an enormously sensitive issue among hard-liners in the Iranian military and clerical leaders who have made opposition to the United States the centerpiece of their political narratives. “Iran-U.S. relations have nothing to do with this,” Mr. Zarif said emphatically at a university here, where the agreement was announced. “This was an attempt to resolve the nuclear issue.” While saying he hoped the two countries would find a way to melt away their distrust as the agreement was carried out, he hastened to add, “We have serious differences with the United States.” Now, attention will shift to Mr. Obama and Hassan Rouhani, the Iranian president, who was elected on a platform of ending sanctions. They share a common task: selling the agreement at home to constituencies deeply suspicious of both the deal and the prospect of signing any accord with an avowed enemy. The White House has promised a lobbying campaign by the president unlike any seen since he pushed through health care legislation. Mr. Zarif and other Iranian officials may have an even harder political argument to win. They will have to overcome objections in the military and scientific establishments, especially because the accord will force them to cut the number of centrifuges enriching uranium by half, put thousands of others in storage and convert two other facilities into research sites that would have virtually no fissile material — the makings of an atom bomb. Iran has insisted that its nuclear program is for civilian uses only. Mr. Zarif seemed to sense the scope of the challenge in how he framed the agreement. He focused on the fact that Iran would not have to dismantle any facilities — something Washington had initially demanded, especially after helping expose one such secret facility, called Fordo, in Mr. Obama’s first year in office. When, late on Thursday, the White House began distributing a description of what amounted to Iranian concessions, an obviously angry Mr. Zarif challenged the American accounting in several posts on Twitter. Whether Iran is racing toward nuclear weapon capabilities is one of the most contentious foreign-policy issues challenging the West. “There is no need to spin using ‘fact sheets’ so early on,” he wrote in one , only an hour or so after. In another, he suggested that sanctions would have to be lifted far earlier than one might think listening to Mr. Kerry, saying that, in essence, all the economic sanctions would be lifted once a final agreement was signed. That could be another issue for the two sides, in that Washington has insisted that the sanctions be removed in a step-by-step manner as Iran fulfills its obligations under the agreement. At another point, Mr. Zarif cautioned that no one had signed anything in Lausanne, and “nobody has obligations now.” That would come after a final agreement. A guide to help you navigate the deal between global powers and Tehran. Another problem for Mr. Zarif is that the deal he has agreed to is far more restrictive than one he outlined last July in an interview with The New York Times . At that time, he envisioned essentially keeping Iran’s stockpiles and its sprawling nuclear facilities at the levels they are running under a temporary agreement struck 18 months ago. What he agreed to in Lausanne, at least according to those fact sheets, would drastically cut Iran’s capability for 10 years and then allow it to build up gradually for the next five. After that, Iran would be free to produce as much uranium as it wishes — even building the 190,000 centrifuges that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei talked about last summer. That is bound to be a major concern for Congress, the Israelis and the Arab states, because it amounts to a bet that after 15 years, Iran will be a far more cooperative international player, perhaps under different management. The 5,060 centrifuges is a far higher figure than the administration originally envisioned, when it argued that Iran could possess only a few hundred. But in the final negotiations, Mr. Moniz and his Iranian counterpart, Ali Akbar Salehi, the M.I.T.-educated head of Iran’s atomic energy agency, agreed that Iran would drastically cut its stockpile of nuclear fuel, from about eight tons to a little over 600 pounds. The giant underground enrichment site at Fordo, which Israeli and some American officials fear is impervious to bombing, would be partly converted to advanced nuclear research and the production of medical isotopes. About two thirds of its centrifuges would be removed. Eventually, foreign scientists would be present. It would have no fissile material that could be used to make a bomb. But perhaps the most important compromise came in a lengthy battle over whether Iran would be allowed to conduct research and development on advanced centrifuges, which are far more efficient than current models. The Iranians won the right to research, but not to use more modern machines for production for the next 10 years. At Arak, which officials feared could produce plutonium, another pathway to a bomb, Iran agreed to redesign a heavy-water reactor in a way that would keep it from producing weapons-usable fuel. Those conditions impressed two of the most skeptical experts on the negotiations: Gary Samore and Olli Heinonen of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard and members of a group called United Against Nuclear Iran. Mr. Samore, who was Mr. Obama’s top adviser on weapons of mass destruction in his first term as president, said in an email that the deal was a “very satisfactory resolution of Fordo and Arak issues for the 15-year term” of the accord. He had more questions about operations at Natanz and said there was “much detail to be negotiated, but I think it’s enough to be called a political framework.” Mr. Heinonen, the former chief inspector of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said, “It appears to be a fairly comprehensive deal with most important parameters.” But he cautioned that “Iran maintains enrichment capacity which will be beyond its near-term needs.” Thomas Erdbrink contributed reporting from Tehran, and Julie Hirschfeld Davis from Washington. video Advertisement"
"Landmark Caspian Sea deal signed by five coastal nations","Convention seen as vital to break Iran’s sense of economic isolation after US sanctions  Phoebe Greenwood in Aktau  Sun 12 Aug 2018 14.14 BST   Last modified on Sun 12 Aug 2018 14.48 BST   Vladimir Putin met the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, on Sunday at the close of a dramatic week in which each had been threatened with punishing economic sanctions by the US. But they were not meeting to publicly agree a united response to the act of “economic warfare”, as Russia described the sanctions. The two presidents were in the small Kazakh coastal city of Aktau to sign a legal convention on the Caspian Sea. After more than 20 years of fraught diplomatic efforts, the five littoral Caspian nations – Russia, Iran, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan – agreed upon a legal framework for sharing the world’s largest inland body of water, which bridges Asia and Europe and has reserves of oil and gas as well as being a habitat for sturgeon. Diplomats described the document as a regional constitution. Putin told a room where presidents and foreign ministers were present: “Our summit is exceptional if not truly epoch making.” Rouhani was more circumspect: “Today we have taken a very important step but we should recognise there are more important issues that need to be addressed.” He thanked his Caspian partners for their support since the withdrawal by the US from the nuclear deal known as the joint comprehensive plan of action . This was a hard-won diplomatic victory. As late as last week Iranian analysts reported that Tehran was “50:50” on whether to sign. The main sticking point was how to apportion the seabed. Many favour division by a line equidistant from the five coastlines, but Iran – with the smallest coastline – does not. Russia was reluctant to allow Turkmenistan to pursue its proposed 300km gas pipeline to Azerbaijan , which would open up its huge, cheap, gas reserves to a European market at present dominated by Gazprom. The solution, it seems, has been to keep the wording vague and delay divisive decisions. On Sunday the five nations agreed to 15 miles of sovereign waters, in addition to a further 10 nautical miles of fishing area, beyond which there would be common waters. “What does this mean? Who knows,” one delegate told the Guardian. “The lawyers will have to tell you.” The thorny issue of how to split up the hydrocarbon-rich subsoil territory has been put off. Reading from the convention document, Kairat Abdrakhmanov, the Kazakh foreign minister, told the press: “The methodology for establishing state base lines shall be determined in a separate agreement among all the parties according to this convention on the legal status of the Caspian Sea. This is a key phrase, especially important for our Iranian partners.” The Caspian Sea, which was once controlled by Iran, is a sensitive issue for that country. It lost the northern part of the sea in a defeat by Russia in the 1820s and the loss seems still traumatic. Rouhani’s critics will paint any perceived concession at the summit as national betrayal. But Rouhani is not well placed to quibble with his neighbours. Since the US president, Donald Trump, issued his twitter threat to unleash “the most biting sanctions ever imposed” on Iran with a promise that “anyone doing business with Iran will not be doing business with the United States”, Tehran has been scrambling to fill dangerous new holes in its economy. Its preference has long been to reach for trade and diplomatic partnerships in Europe but now the US has effectively cut this market off, Iran has been forced to turn to Russia, China and its regional allies to keep its economy afloat. Asked if they feared sanctions on the two big regional players would undermine the Caspian’s trading potential, Aktau delegates responded with wait-and-see pragmatism. “We will have to look into this issue, but for us Iran is an opportunity. It’s a huge country and a huge market. We should not miss this opportunity of cooperating with them,” said a senior Kazakh diplomat. “Iran is our neighbour and our inevitable partner.” Trump’s goal to reduce Iranian oil sales to zero by November is looking increasingly implausible. On Friday, Iran’s biggest oil customer, China, said it would keep doing business with Iran. Rouhani would have used his bilateral meeting with Putin on the sidelines of the summit to seek similar assurances. “Putin and Rouhani have very good personal relations. They understand each other,” Stanislav Pritchin , a political analyst and Caspian Sea expert said. “They will discuss sanctions and how to deal with the new circumstances – also the Syrian situation, especially Israel’s attempts to force Iranian troops from Syrian territory, which is completely unacceptable for Iran. But the Russian media won’t cover these meetings. The signing of the convention is the real outcome – that is the great success.” A legally binding convention that prevents Caspian nations from opening their borders to third-party aggressors – such as the US or Nato – or allowing any foreign military presence at all on Caspian waters is a triumph for Putin. For Rouhani, a strategic display of Russian support is more pressing. Ariane Tabatabai , a political scientist and co-author of Triple Axis, Iran’s relations with Russia and China, said: “Rouhani needs to indicate to [the Iranian] public he’s doing everything he can to address their economic grievances and reassure the population it’s not isolated. That’s been the major talking point for the Iranian government in the past few weeks. “The best possible outcome for the Iranians will be to walk away with something tangible to take back to Tehran that says we’re doing just fine with or without US sanctions.” But bound by sanctions of its own Russia has not got much to give in the way of economic lifelines. The best Putin can offer is assistance in developing Iranian gas fields or some form of cooperation between state-owned institutions already blighted by existing sanctions and written off as toxic. When it comes to substantial reassurances which Rouhani can take back to an anxious Tehran, an awkward alliance with some trade-friendly neighbours might have to do."
"Obama Yields, Allowing Congress Say on Iran Nuclear Deal","Advertisement Supported by By  Jonathan Weisman and Peter Baker WASHINGTON — The White House relented on Tuesday and said President Obama would sign a compromise bill giving Congress a voice on the proposed nuclear accord with Iran as the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, in rare unanimous agreement, moved the legislation to the full Senate for a vote. An unusual alliance of Republican opponents of the nuclear deal and some of Mr. Obama’s strongest Democratic supporters demanded a congressional role as international negotiators work to turn this month’s nuclear framework into a final deal by June 30. White House officials insisted they extracted crucial last-minute concessions. Republicans — and many Democrats — said the president simply got overrun. “We’re involved here. We have to be involved here,” said Senator Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland, the committee’s ranking Democrat, who served as a bridge between the White House and Republicans as they negotiated changes in the days before the committee’s vote on Tuesday. “Only Congress can change or permanently modify the sanctions regime.” The essence of the legislation is that Congress will have a chance to vote on whatever deal emerges with Iran — if one is reached by June 30 — but in a way that would be extremely difficult for Mr. Obama to lose, allowing Secretary of State John Kerry to tell his Iranian counterpart that the risk that an agreement would be upended on Capitol Hill is limited. As Congress considers any accord on a very short timetable, it would essentially be able to vote on an eventual end to sanctions, and then later take up the issue depending on whether Iran has met its own obligations. But if it rejected the agreement, Mr. Obama could veto that legislation — and it would take only 34 senators to sustain the veto, meaning that Mr. Obama could lose upward of a dozen Democratic senators and still prevail. The bill would require that the administration send the text of a final accord, along with classified material, to Congress as soon as it is completed. It also halts any lifting of sanctions pending a 30-day congressional review, and culminates in a possible vote to allow or forbid the lifting of congressionally imposed sanctions in exchange for the dismantling of much of Iran’s nuclear infrastructure. It passed 19 to 0. Why Mr. Obama gave in after fierce opposition was the last real dispute of what became a rout. Josh Earnest, the White House spokesman, said Mr. Obama was not “particularly thrilled” with the bill, but had decided that a new proposal put together by the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee made enough changes to make it acceptable. “We’ve gone from a piece of legislation that the president would veto to a piece of legislation that’s undergone substantial revision such that it’s now in the form of a compromise that the president would be willing to sign,” Mr. Earnest said. “That would certainly be an improvement.” Senator Bob Corker , Republican of Tennessee and the committee’s chairman, had a far different interpretation. As late as 11:30 a.m., in a classified briefing at the Capitol, Mr. Kerry was urging senators to oppose the bill. The “change occurred when they saw how many senators were going to vote for this, and only when that occurred,” Mr. Corker said. Mr. Cardin said that the “fundamental provisions” of the legislation had not changed. But the compromise between him and Mr. Corker did shorten a review period of a final Iran nuclear deal and soften language that would make the lifting of sanctions dependent on Iran’s ending support for terrorism. The agreement almost certainly means Congress will muscle its way into nuclear negotiations that Mr. Obama sees as a legacy-defining foreign policy achievement. The Senate is expected to vote on the legislation this month, and House Republican leaders have promised to pass it shortly after. “Congress absolutely should have the opportunity to review this deal,” the House speaker, John A. Boehner of Ohio, said Tuesday. “We shouldn’t just count on the administration, who appears to want a deal at any cost.” White House officials blitzed Congress in the days after the framework of a nuclear deal was announced, making 130 phone calls to lawmakers, but quickly came to the conclusion that the legislation could not be blocked altogether. Moreover, officials increasingly worried that an unresolved fight could torpedo the next phase of negotiations with Iran. “Having this lingering uncertainty about whether we could deliver on our side of the deal was probably a deal killer,” said a senior administration official, who asked for anonymity to describe internal deliberations. Under the compromise legislation, a 60-day review period of a final nuclear agreement in the original bill was in effect cut in half, to 30 days, starting with its submission to Congress. But tacked on to that review period potentially would be the maximum 12 days the president would have to decide whether to accept or veto a resolution of disapproval, should Congress take that vote. The formal review period would also include a maximum of 10 days Congress would have to override the veto. For Republicans, that would mean the president could not lift sanctions for a maximum of 52 days after submitting a final accord to Congress, along with all classified material. American and Iranian officials are using different words to describe elements of the preliminary agreement to limit Iran’s nuclear program. And if a final accord is not submitted to Congress by July 9, the review period will snap back to 60 days. That would prevent the administration from intentionally delaying the submission of the accord to the Capitol. Congress could not reopen the mechanics of a deal, and taking no action would be the equivalent of allowing it to move forward. Mr. Corker also agreed to a significant change on the terrorism language. Initially, the bill said the president had to certify every 90 days that Iran no longer was supporting terrorism against Americans. If he could not, economic sanctions would be reimposed. Under the agreement, the president would still have to send periodic reports to Congress on Iran’s activities regarding ballistic missiles and terrorism, but those reports could not trigger another round of sanctions. The measure still faces hurdles. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, fresh off the opening of his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, dropped plans to push for an amendment to make any Iran deal dependent on the Islamic Republic’s recognition of the State of Israel, a diplomatic nonstarter. But he hinted that he could try on the Senate floor. “Not getting anything done plays right into the hands of the administration,” Mr. Rubio said. Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, abandoned an amendment to make any Iran accord into a formal international treaty needing two-thirds of the Senate for its ratification, but he, too, said it could be revived before the full Senate. Mr. Earnest said the president also wanted no more changes. “We’re asking for a commitment that people will pursue the process that’s contemplated in this bill,” he said. Democrats had implored Mr. Obama to embrace the legislation. “If the administration can’t persuade 34 senators of whatever party that this agreement is worth proceeding with, then it’s really a bad agreement,” Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, a Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, said. “That’s the threshold.” To temper opposition to the deal, Mr. Kerry, Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew and Energy Secretary Ernest J. Moniz gathered with senators Tuesday morning in a classified briefing, after a similar briefing on Monday for the House. But the administration met firm opposition in both parties. The agreement “puts Iran, the world’s worst state sponsor of terrorism, on the path to a nuclear weapon,” said Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, as he emerged from the briefing. “Whether that’s a matter of months or a matter of years, that’s a dangerous outcome not just to United States and allies like Israel but to the entire world.” An earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of the Secretary of Energy. He is Ernest Moniz, not Earnest. David E. Sanger and Emmarie Huetteman contributed reporting. video Advertisement"
"U.N. General Assembly: Trump Leads Security Council Meeting","Advertisement Supported by By  The New York Times A day after President Trump appeared before the United Nations and made clear his disdain for a global approach to problem solving, he returned on Wednesday to wield the gavel at a meeting of the Security Council, the world organization’s most powerful body. As the council’s current president, a rotating position, Mr. Trump is leading the group’s meeting on  nonproliferation . But in his opening remarks, he focused his attention instead on sanctions against Iran and accused China of trying to meddle in the midterm elections in the United States, apparently referring to China’s retaliatory tariffs in an escalating trade war with that country. Mr. Trump also met with Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister of Israel, before the Security Council session and pledged his commitment to stand behind Israel “100 percent” while working toward a Middle East peace deal. A day earlier, in his speech before the United Nations General Assembly, some in the audience laughed as Mr. Trump said that more had been done so far during his time in office than in “almost any administration in the history of our country.” [ Mr. Trump has accused China of interfering in the midterm elections . ] During his opening remarks at the Security Council on Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump accused China of trying to meddle in the United States’ midterm elections. “Regrettably, we found that China is attempting to interfere in our upcoming 2018 election, coming up in November, against my administration,” Mr. Trump said. “They do not want me, or us, to win, because I am the first president ever to challenge China on trade. And we are winning on trade, we are winning at every level.” Mr. Trump provided no evidence to back up this assertion, though it appears he was referring to China’s retaliatory tariffs in the escalating trade war. Later in the day, during an evening news conference, he asserted that “we have evidence” of China’s interference. “I like China and I like President Xi a lot,” Mr. Trump said, but later added, “They’re trying to convince people to go against Trump.” Much of his speech at the Security Council was spent criticizing Iran, a theme that also dominated his address to the General Assembly a day earlier. “The regime is the world’s leading sponsor of terror and fuels conflict across the region and beyond,” Mr. Trump said, before calling the Iran nuclear deal a “horrible, one-sided” agreement. Before the 2015 nuclear accord, he said of Iran, “They were in big, big trouble.” “They needed cash; we gave it to them,” Mr. Trump said, referring to the lifting of sanctions as a result of the deal. He said he planned to introduce new economic sanctions on Iran later this year, adding that they would be “tougher than ever before.” Yet Mr. Trump also had positive words for Iran, thanking that country and Russia for delaying a planned offensive on Syria’s Idlib Province. President Emmanuel Macron of France, who spoke to the Security Council directly after Mr. Trump, urged unity within the group. He said that relations with Iran must not be limited to a “policy of sanctions,” and that long-term strategies must be put in place. The 15-member Security Council is the most powerful arm of the United Nations, with the ability to impose sanctions and authorize military intervention. — MEGAN SPECIA and TESS FELDER Mr. Trump’s accusation that China is meddling in the midterm elections made it sound as if Beijing was using cyber and disinformation techniques, similar to what Russia did in the 2016 presidential election. But so far, neither intelligence agencies nor private cyber security firms have reported that kind of activity. Instead, according to one administration official, Mr. Trump appeared to be referring to how China has targeted its retaliatory tariffs — aiming some of them at states and industries that Mr. Trump and the Republican Party need to hold on to in the coming elections. The official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said Mr. Trump was angry about the tariffs and views them as a kind of political influence. If so, China would not be the first country to use trade to achieve political ends in the United States. In the 1980s, Japan strategically placed auto plants and their suppliers in critical congressional districts, hoping to head off any action against its auto industry. American officials have previously used trade actions to affect politics in Japan and South Korea. But this was the first time that Mr. Trump has directly accused China of interfering in American politics in an effort to challenge him. And it is at odds with his repeated comments that he has a strong relationship with China’s leader, Xi Jinping, who presumably has had a strong hand in each of the retaliatory actions taken by Beijing. A month ago, the director of national intelligence, Dan Coates, warned that the “system is blinking red” for the coming elections. But he was referring chiefly to fears of Russian activity, his aides said at the time, and he made almost no mention of China. —DAVID E. SANGER During a news conference, President Trump confirmed that he rejected a one-on-one meeting with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and slammed Canada for recent disagreements over trade. “Frankly, we are thinking about just taxing cars that are coming in from Canada,” Mr. Trump said. “We are very unhappy with the negotiations — with the negotiating style — of Canada.” He went on to criticize Canada’s negotiations over the Nafta trade deal — an agreement he called “very bad for the U.S.” — and the recent tariffs put in place on American-made products. “Canada has treated us very badly, they have treated our farmers in Wisconsin and New York State very badly,” he said. “So Canada has a long way to go, I must be honest with you, we are not getting along with their negotiators at all.” While he did not rule out the prospect of a new trade deal with Canada, he said it would probably be very different from what the Canadians are seeking. — MEGAN SPECIA As the world’s oldest leader at age 93, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia has seen a lot of politicians come and go — including himself: He previously served as prime minister from 1982 to 2003, and returned to power in May. He has also stood up to his giant neighbor, China, diplomatically pushing back on financially onerous Chinese projects in Malaysia . While visiting New York for the United Nations General Assembly this week, he offered some cautionary advice for President Trump: Don’t push too hard, he said of Mr. Trump’s comments regarding the Chinese government. “I get the impression he doesn’t know much about Asia,” the Malaysian leader said at a meeting of the Council on Foreign Relations. Asked whether he thought a rapidly modernizing China was engaged in a new colonialism among its Asian neighbors, Mr. Mahathir answered indirectly, “When China is poor, it is dangerous,” he said. “When China is rich, it also is dangerous.” While Mr. Trump has sought to cast China as a villain in his campaign to “make America great again,” Mr. Mahathir suggested that more subtlety was required. “We have been dealing with China for 2,000 years,” he said. “I think you can make America great in many other ways.” — RICK GLADSTONE Before the Security Council meeting, Mr. Trump met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel. In a news briefing, Mr. Trump said he wanted to reassure Mr. Netanyahu and Israelis that “we are with Israel 100 percent.” Mr. Trump said he expected to have a framework for a Middle East peace deal in the next “two to three to four months.” “I like two-state solution,” he said, according to a White House pool report. “I really believe something will happen,” Mr. Trump said. “It is a dream of mine to be able to get that done prior to the end of my first term.” On the way into the Security Council meeting, Mr. Trump was asked whether he was willing to meet with President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela. Mr. Trump said he was not opposed to the idea. “I’m willing to meet with anybody, anytime I can save lives and help people,” he said. “If it’s one life, I am certainly willing to.” — MEGAN SPECIA Evo Morales, the president of Bolivia, took aim squarely at the United States in a statement delivered at the Security Council on Wednesday. Sitting just two seats from Mr. Trump, Mr. Morales said he “categorically condemns” the United States for reneging on its obligations under the Iran nuclear deal under “false pretenses.” Then he slammed the United States’ human rights record. “In no way is the U.S. interested in spreading democracy,” Mr. Morales said. “The United States could not care less about human rights or justice.” He went on to list his criticism of the United States: for “keeping children in cages,” a reference to the detention and separation of migrant children from their families at the United States-Mexico border; for Mr. Trump’s statements that the International Criminal Court has no jurisdiction or legitimacy; and for critical statements Mr. Trump has made about the Human Rights Council. The leftist Bolivian leader has been a vocal critic of United States foreign policy since he took office in 2006. Bolivia joined the Security Council for a two-year term in 2017 as one of the 10 rotating United Nations member states on the council. Mr. Trump offered a gruff, “Thank you, Mr. President,” to Mr. Morales before handing the floor over to the next speaker. — MEGAN SPECIA President Hassan Rouhani of Iran, apparently emboldened by the less-than-enthusiastic United Nations reception for President Trump this week, said the United States had isolated itself at the world organization by renouncing the Iran nuclear agreement and by warning others they should heed restored American sanctions or face reprisals. At a news conference near the end of his annual visit to the General Assembly, Mr. Rouhani thanked the many other member states, including close American allies, that have expressed support for the nuclear accord, which the United States quit in May on Mr. Trump’s orders. Mr. Trump, the Iranian president said, ordered other countries not only to ignore the nuclear accord but also to essentially disregard Security Council Resolution 2231, which put it into effect. Security Council resolutions are supposed to be regarded as having the force of law. “It is quite strange, asking other members not to adhere to 2231,” Mr. Rouhani told reporters. Asked if Iran felt isolated and surrounded by hostile powers in the Middle East, Mr. Rouhani responded: “We’re not isolated. America is isolated.” While he acknowledged that restored American sanctions had put pressure on his country, Mr. Rouhani said, “Iran has been in much tougher positions.” He thanked European countries that have pushed for the survival of the nuclear agreement, even without the Americans. But he would not rule out the possibility that Iran itself might also quit the accord if it does not get the promised economic benefits. The Trump administration had long hinted it would quit the accord, in which Iran made verifiable guarantees of peaceful nuclear work in exchange for relaxed economic sanctions. Mr. Trump called the agreement a disastrous giveaway to Iran that merely postponed its ability to become a nuclear-armed state. — RICK GLADSTONE Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain used her speech to the General Assembly on Wednesday to reaffirm her country’s “commitment to work together to address shared global challenges,” even as she defended its decision to quit the European Union. “The vote by the British people to leave the European Union was not a rejection of multilateralism or international cooperation,” Mrs. May said of the process known as Brexit. “It was a clear demand for decisions and accountability to lie closer to home.” At the same time, she said, countries should not be afraid to stand up and intervene when other nations flagrantly violate norms and rights. She cited Britain’s decision to participate in airstrikes with the United States and France against Syria in response to suspected chemical attacks. Mrs. May acknowledged what she described as “mistakes of the past,” a reference to Britain’s much-criticized role in the Iraq war, but said those mistakes should not justify a failure to act when needed. The prime minister also warned of the rise of extremist political ideologies on the right and left in Europe and beyond. “We have seen what happens when countries slide into authoritarianism, slowly crushing the basic freedoms and rights of their citizens,” she said. “We have seen what happens when corrupt oligarchies rob their nations of the wealth, resources and human capital that are so vital to unlocking a brighter future for their citizens.” And she gave a shout-out to the news media. “Like many leaders, I suspect, I do not always enjoy reading what the media in my country writes about me,” Mrs. May said. “But I will defend their right to say it, for the independence of our media is one of my country’s greatest achievements, and it is the bedrock of our democracy.” — MICHAEL SCHWIRTZ Reporting was contributed by Rick Gladstone, Michael Schwirtz, Megan Specia, Tess Felder, Mark Landler and David E.

"U.N. General Assembly: Criticism and Praise for Trump Administration","Advertisement Supported by By  The New York Times Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and his Palestinian counterpart, President Mahmoud Abbas, both spoke in front of world leaders on Thursday, offering diametrically opposing views on the causes of the protracted Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Their speeches come a day after President Trump said he hoped to announce the framework for a peace deal in the coming months. Earlier this week, Mr. Trump largely overshadowed the other heads of state who gathered for the 73rd assembly, first drawing laughter from a roomful of foreign leaders and then surprising many when he accused China of interfering in the midterm elections . President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority assailed the Trump administration on Thursday over pro-Israel decisions that he said “completely contradict” America’s role as a mediator. Mr. Abbas exhorted President Trump to rescind the decisions, which moved the American Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, defunded Palestinian aid, challenged the status of Palestinian refugees and countenanced Israeli settlement expansion. “Jerusalem is not for sale, and the Palestinian people’s rights are not up for bargaining,” Mr. Abbas said in his speech to a mostly friendly audience at the United Nations General Assembly. He also assailed an Israeli law narrowly passed in July that enshrined Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, made Hebrew the only official language and asserted that the right of national self-determination was “unique to the Jewish people.” The new law, Mr. Abbas said, “will inevitably lead to the creation of one racist state, an apartheid state, and nullifies the two-state solution.” — RICK GLADSTONE Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, who took the General Assembly podium a few speakers after Mr. Abbas had finished, quickly launched into a new accusation against Iran, which Israel regards as its top foe. Armed with what he described as visual evidence, Mr. Netanyahu said Iran had a “secret atomic warehouse” that Israeli intelligence had discovered, and he called on international nuclear inspectors to examine it. Turning to the Palestinians, Mr. Netanyahu angrily rejected Mr. Abbas’s portrayal of Israel as an apartheid state like the former South Africa. “President Abbas, you proudly pay Palestinian terrorists who murder Jews, in fact, the more they slay the more you pay, and you condemn Israel’s morality, you call Israel racist?” Mr. Netanyahu said. “This is not the way to peace.” Mr. Netanyahu also thanked President Trump and the American ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki R. Haley, for what he described as the “unwavering support they have provided Israel at the United Nations.” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday that the world was at “ the dawn of a new day ” in confronting the threat posed by North Korea’s weapons programs. But he warned that sanctions against the country must continue for now. Addressing the United Nations Security Council, Mr. Pompeo said that Mr. Trump’s summit meeting in Singapore with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, in June had laid the groundwork for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. But he told the Council that until that process is complete, the world must abide by the economic sanctions on Pyongyang. “We must not forget what’s brought us this far: the historic international pressure campaign that this Council has made possible through the sanctions that it imposed,” he said. Mr. Pompeo met on Wednesday with his North Korean counterpart, Ri Yong-ho, and will travel to Pyongyang next month in part to set the stage for a second summit meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim. While North Korea has halted its public tests of nuclear bombs and ballistic missiles, intelligence indicates that it has shown no slackening in its pace in building such weapons. Still, Russia and China called for the sanctions to be eased to reward North Korea for the progress made so far. Sergey V. Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, criticized the United States for wanting to tighten sanctions, saying that tougher measures would harm North Koreans. — GARDINER HARRIS Jacinda Ardern , New Zealand’s prime minister, urged world leaders to embrace collective action in her statement to the General Assembly. “In the face of isolationism, protectionism, racism — the simple concept of looking outwardly and beyond ourselves, of kindness and collectivism, might just be as good a starting point as any,” said Ms. Ardern, 38, who this week became the first head of state to bring her baby — 3-month-old Neve Gayford — to the United Nations. In her speech, she repeatedly called on members to commit to rebuilding global institutions, not consign them to history. Ms. Ardern said that instead of seeking to “blame the nameless, faceless other,” world leaders must instead “rebuild and recommit to multilateralism.” Visiting the United Nations for the first time, Ms. Ardern devoted a large portion of her speech to climate change, the effects of which she called “not academic, or even arguable.” Ms. Ardern later received a round of applause when she spoke about gender equality. “MeToo must become WeToo,” Ms. Ardern said. She noted while New Zealand had just marked its 125th anniversary of women’s suffrage — it was the first country in the world to grant women the right to vote — it has also struggled with a gender pay gap, a disproportionate number of women in low-paid work and high levels of domestic violence. — CHARLOTTE GRAHAM-MCLAY As speeches from world leaders proceeded at the General Assembly in New York on Thursday, the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva voted to establish a mechanism for gathering and preserving evidence of war crimes against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar. The move is seen by some legal experts as an important step toward accountability and justice for the Rohingya. Last year, Myanmar’s military began a broad campaign of ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya — a minority ethnic group in Myanmar’s Rakhine State — burning villages, killing thousands and forcing hundreds of thousands to flee to Bangladesh. While international lawmakers welcomed Thursday’s development, many see it as a starting point and urged action in the International Criminal Court. “The creation of this evidence gathering mechanism is a welcome concrete step towards justice,” Matt Pollard, a senior legal adviser for the International Commission of Jurists, said in a statement after the vote. “But this is a stopgap measure, effectively creating a prosecutor without a court, that only underscores the urgent need for the Security Council to refer the entire situation to the International Criminal Court, which was created for precisely such circumstances.” — MEGAN SPECIA During his opening remarks at the Security Council on Wednesday, Mr. Trump accused China of trying to meddle in this November’s United States elections. “Regrettably, we found that China is attempting to interfere in our upcoming 2018 election, coming up in November, against my administration,” Mr. Trump said. “They do not want me, or us, to win, because I am the first president ever to challenge China on trade.

President Emmanuel Macron of France, who spoke to the Security Council directly after Mr. Trump, urged unity within the group. He said that relations with Iran must not be limited to a “policy of sanctions” and that long-term strategies must be put in place. — MEGAN SPECIA and TESS FELDER As the world’s oldest leader at age 93, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia has seen a lot of politicians come and go — including himself: He served as prime minister from 1982 to 2003, and returned to power in May.

America is isolated.” While he acknowledged that United States sanctions had put pressure on his country, Mr. Rouhani said, “Iran has been in much tougher positions.” And even as he thanked European countries for abiding by the nuclear agreement, he would not rule out the possibility that Iran itself might also abandon the accord if it does not get the promised economic benefits. — RICK GLADSTONE Reporting was contributed by Rick Gladstone, Michael Schwirtz, Megan Specia, Tess Felder, Mark Landler, David E.

"Will the Iran nuclear deal survive Trump’s wrecking crew?","If the US pulls out, we could be heading down the path of another senseless war. That’s why the forces of the UN, Congress and the American public are so pivotal  Fri 27 Apr 2018 11.00 BST   Last modified on Tue 8 May 2018 03.07 BST   O n 12 May, President Trump will decide whether or not to stay in the Iran nuclear deal . If the US pulls out, as Trump has threatened to do, we could be careening down the path of another catastrophic, senseless war in the Middle East. That’s why the countervailing forces of European leaders, the UN, the US Congress and the American public are so pivotal. The US already made a catastrophic blunder in Iran, a blunder that is still reverberating six decades later. In a foreign policy speech delivered in September 2017, Senator Bernie Sanders talked about the 1953 CIA coup that toppled Iran’s elected prime minister, Mohammad Mosaddegh, on behalf of western oil interests, and the reinstallation of the corrupt, brutal and unpopular Shah. Sanders explained that in 1979, the Shah was overthrown by anti-American revolutionaries led by Ayatollah Khomeini, and the Islamic Republic of Iran was created. Then he mused : “What would Iran look like today if their democratic government had not been overthrown? What impact did that American-led coup have on the entire region? What consequences are we still living with today?” To answer Sanders’ questions, without the CIA coup , there would probably never have been an Islamic revolution in 1979 or a decades-long conflict between Iranian leaders and the west. The 1979 revolution impacted the region by unleashing ferocious schisms. The new Iranian Shia leadership began vying for supremacy in the Middle East with Sunni-majority Saudi Arabia, a bitter rivalry that continues today. The 1979 revolution also created a crisis between Israel and Iran , with Iran’s religious leaders viewing the Israelis as US puppets and denouncing the oppression of Palestinians. Today, both the Saudis and Israelis are trying to suck the US into their decades-old feud with Iran. They have both opposed the Iran nuclear deal . Israel has been advocating for the US military to bomb Iran’s nuclear facilities, even though Israel has several hundred nuclear weapons of its own and Iran has none. Saudi Arabia insists that Iran is spreading terrorism throughout the region, even though the Saudis have spent billions of dollars spreading their intolerant version of Islam, Wahhabism, around the world. It is the Saudi’s extremist Sunni ideology , not Shiism, that forms the theological underpinnings of radical terrorist groups from al-Qaeda to Isis. While less oppressive than the Saudi monarchy, the Iranian theocracy is no model democracy. It restricts the freedoms of its citizens and gives the clerics too much power over all other branches of government. But upending the nuclear agreement will be a boon to Iran’s conservative clerics, the very ones we don’t want to embolden. President Hassan Rouhani, considered a moderate, will lose power to the hardliners, who were against negotiating with the west from the get-go. The ascendance of the conservatives could lead to a backlash against the more secular, liberal forces in Iran. Strengthening the hardliners would also spell more chaos in the region. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) is Iran’s elite military force responsible for protecting the Islamic regime from internal and external threats. The IRGC and its allies like Hezbollah are fighting proxy wars against the Saudis from Yemen to Syria. But Trump’s concerns about Iranian support for the “three Hs” – Hezbollah, Hamas and the Houthis – will be exacerbated if the deal is undone, as the IRGC will have an even greater justification to oppose US policies in the Middle East and to target US allies. The IRGC could immediately retaliate by attacking both Israel and US troops stationed in Iraq, Afghanistan and on military bases throughout the Middle East. If the US breaks with the nuclear deal, Iran would be free to reconstitute its nuclear program and quickly move ahead. It could install more centrifuges and produce as much enriched uranium or plutonium as it wants. If US officials are troubled by Iran’s foreign policy now, imagine how much more powerful a nuclear-armed Iran would be. That’s why Trump’s own secretary of defense, James Mattis, has said that keeping the nuclear agreement intact is in the US national interest. It is also why the other signatories to the agreement – France, Britain, Germany, Russia and China – want to keep it. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, just visited Washington DC, trying to convince Trump not to pull out, and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, is meeting with Trump on Friday with the same message. The nuclear agreement was not only made between six nations, but by the entire UN system. The UN security council approved the deal by a 15-0 vote. Putting the deal in jeopardy would compromise the entire international framework for nonviolent conflict resolution and sink international respect for US leadership to a new low. This is a particularly critical point right now, with momentous talks with North Korea tentatively scheduled for May. Breaking the Iran deal will put those talks in jeopardy. Why would Kim Jong-un sign an agreement with Trump if he goes back on a deal already signed with Iran, a deal that Iran was complying with, a deal that was approved by the entire international community? The Trump administration should not only honor the agreement, it should use it as a springboard to work with Iran to defuse the conflicts consuming the region and to normalize relations with Tehran. Unfortunately, the triumvirate of Trump, the national security adviser, John Bolton, and secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, are likely to pull in the opposite direction. It’s up to us to push back. Before the Trump wrecking crew destroys the best global foreign policy achievement in the last decade, the world community – including the UN, Congress and the public – has to stop them."
"Emmanuel Macron to Press Trump to Keep Iran Nuclear Deal","Advertisement Supported by By  Peter Baker and Julie Hirschfeld Davis WASHINGTON — President Trump will come under increasing pressure from visiting French and German leaders this week not to scrap the three-year-old nuclear agreement with Iran next month as American and European negotiators make tentative progress toward a new deal to toughen the limits on Tehran. President Emmanuel Macron of France arrived Monday at the White House for the first state visit of Mr. Trump’s presidency, intent on using his unusual bond with the American president to try to persuade him to preserve the Iran deal, at least for now. While not as close personally to Mr. Trump, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany will follow on Friday to reinforce the message. The back-to-back visits come weeks before a May 12 deadline set by Mr. Trump to “fix” the Iran agreement or walk away from it. Under the agreement, sealed in 2015 by President Barack Obama, Iran has curbed its nuclear program in exchange for relief from crippling international sanctions. But Mr. Trump and other critics have assailed it because it begins to expire after a decade and does not block Iran’s missile development or try to stop it from destabilizing the region. In recent weeks, American and European negotiators have made progress toward side agreements that would lay out new standards for Iran to meet or risk the reimposition of sanctions by the West. Negotiators have generally reached a consensus on measures to constrain Iran’s ballistic missile program, according to people briefed on the talks, but remain divided over how to extend the restrictions of the original agreement due to lapse starting in 2025. Most importantly, the Europeans want assurances that if side agreements are reached, the United States will stay in the deal, a hard commitment for American officials to make given Mr. Trump’s mercurial nature. But European leaders hope they can persuade him to hold off by showing enough progress in negotiations that he can claim he is making the deal better. “I suspect that this will be a very difficult conversation,” said Wendy R. Sherman, the former top State Department official who negotiated the Iran deal for Mr. Obama. “I’m sure that Macron will say how important staying in the deal is to a strong trans-Atlantic relationship in all things, particularly security. I think Merkel will deliver the same message on Friday.” Even so, the White House signaled Monday that Mr. Trump enters the talks with one set impression. “He thinks it’s a bad deal — that certainly has not changed,” said Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary. The fate of the Iran agreement could influence the president’s forthcoming meeting with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader who already has a small nuclear arsenal. Whatever its flaws, American officials understand that canceling the Iran deal days or weeks before that meeting might complicate Mr. Trump’s chances of making an agreement with Mr. Kim. Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iran’s foreign minister, implicitly made that point Monday by noting that the negotiations that led to the nuclear agreement between his country and six world powers involved give and take by all sides. “And now the United States is saying, ‘What’s mine is mine and what’s yours is negotiable. But whatever I gave you, now I want it back,’” Mr. Zarif said in an interview with The National Interest , a Washington policy magazine. “Who would, in their right mind, deal with the U.S. anymore?” Mr. Trump faces conflicting positions among his own advisers as he reconstitutes his national security team. John R. Bolton, his new national security adviser, has long advocated simply ending the Iran deal, while Mike Pompeo, set to become secretary of state , is open to keeping it if strong new provisions can be negotiated. Mr. Macron arrived in Washington to a festive welcome. American and French flags flew on Pennsylvania Avenue as he and his wife, Brigitte Macron, were greeted at the White House by Mr. Trump and the first lady, Melania Trump. Mr. Macron reached in for a hug and kissed Mr. Trump on both cheeks, French-style, a sign of their warm ties. The two couples headed inside for a few minutes and then out to the South Lawn, smiling and chatting casually as cameras recorded the moment. Wielding shovels, the two presidents moved some dirt around where a tree was to be planted, a gift from the Macrons. The tree, a European sessile oak, came from Belleau Wood, where, during World War I, nearly 10,000 American Marines were killed or injured in battle in June 1918. From there, the two couples flew by helicopter to George Washington’s Mount Vernon estate for dinner. The Macrons will return to the White House on Tuesday morning for a pomp-filled arrival ceremony on the South Lawn, complete with members of all five branches of the military in formal uniforms. The two presidents will hold meetings and conduct a joint news conference. In the evening, the Trumps will host their first state dinner , featuring rack of spring lamb and Carolina gold rice jambalaya cooked New Orleans style. Mr. Trump, 71, and Mr. Macron, 40, have forged an unlikely friendship , despite their political differences over the Iran deal, international trade, climate change and other issues. But while Europeans consider Mr. Macron their envoy to Mr. Trump, he has had mixed success influencing the president. The two leaders teamed up to launch airstrikes against Syria this month in retaliation for a suspected chemical attack , but when Mr. Macron publicly said he had persuaded Mr. Trump to keep American troops in the country “for the long term,” the White House quickly disputed him. Mr. Macron telegraphed his message on Iran by appearing on the president’s favorite network, Fox News, over the weekend. Is the pact “a perfect thing for our relationship with Iran? No,” he said on “Fox News Sunday.” “But for nuclear, what do you have as a better option? I don’t see it. What is the what-if scenario or your Plan B? I don’t have any Plan B for nuclear against Iran.” Mr. Macron added that he supported modifications to the deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or J.C.P.O.A. “My point is to say, don’t leave now to J.C.P.O.A. as long as you don’t have a better option for nuclear, and let’s complete it with ballistic missile and a regional containment,” Mr. Macron said. Mr. Zarif picked up on that on Monday. “President Macron is correct in saying there’s no ‘Plan B’ on JCPOA,” Mr. Zarif wrote on Twitter . “It’s either all or nothing. European leaders should encourage President Trump not just to stay in the nuclear deal, but more importantly to begin implementing his part of the bargain in good faith.” The negotiations with European officials, led by Brian Hook, the State Department’s director of policy planning, have found some common ground, according to people briefed on the talks. Negotiators are developing two annexes, or side agreements, to the original deal, one intended to constrain Iran’s missile program and the other to confront its aggressions in the Middle East. Negotiators have agreed on strong measures to impose sanctions on Iran if it tests long-range missiles and are debating a framework document to respond to testing of short- and medium-range missiles. They have agreed that Iran would be sanctioned if it blocks international nuclear inspectors from any site, including military sites. And they have made progress in defining a trigger for reimposing sanctions lifted as part of the 2015 deal — if Iran were found to have expanded its nuclear program enough to allow it to develop a weapon in less than a year. But negotiators are divided over what would happen then. The Trump administration insists that sanctions be reimposed automatically if Iran trips that one-year wire, while the Europeans want the trigger to be a determination that Iran’s expansion is inconsistent with its civilian nuclear program. If the Americans and Europeans ultimately agree, that would effectively end the expiration provisions known as “sunsets” by making the one-year limit permanent. “The Europeans have moved very far in a few months, and I think this should be bridgeable, but of course it really depends on Macron and Trump,” said Mark Dubowitz, chief executive of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. “It sounds narrow, but it’s actually pretty fundamental. It’s entirely possible that the thing breaks down on that basis.” The Germans are the most resistant among the Europeans, arguing that renegotiating without Iran or the other parties to the deal, Russia and China, amounts to bad faith and ultimately will cause the original agreement to collapse. If no side agreements are reached, the Trump administration is also preparing contingency plans for Mr. Trump to withdraw from the Iran deal altogether and what the United States would then do to counter Iran. Russia and China have resisted any changes. “We will obstruct attempts to sabotage these agreements, which were enshrined in a U.N. Security Council resolution,” Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, said Monday after meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, in Beijing. But critics of the deal pressed Mr. Trump to remain strong. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel on Monday again condemned the agreement. The deal “gives Iran a clear path to a nuclear arsenal” and “does not deal with the ballistic missiles that can deliver this weapon to many, many countries,” he said. “This is why this deal has to be either fully fixed or fully nixed.” Alissa J.

"Trump Can Make the Most of a Bad Iran Deal","Advertisement Supported by Op-Ed Contributor By  Michael Singh WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said last month that United States policy toward Iran shouldn’t begin and end with the nuclear deal. Washington’s issues with that country are far wider, Mr. Tillerson said, citing Iran’s meddling in Syria and Iraq, and its support for terrorist groups like Hezbollah. The secretary of state is certainly right about that. But he elided an important point: Without a stable approach to the nuclear deal, questions about its fate will distract from and ultimately hobble broader American diplomacy on Iran and other crucial issues in the Middle East. President Trump — who campaigned on promises to tear up the nuclear deal — has indicated that in mid-October, when the next 90-day deadline for recertifying Iran’s compliance with the agreement arrives, he will find that Iran has violated it. This could lead to the deal’s collapse. But there seems to be little evidence that Iran is actually cheating in any significant way. The Iranians appear to be exploiting loopholes in the deal and trying to get away with what they can when it comes to the deal’s limits on certain nuclear activities like the production and storage of heavy water. Likewise, they seem to be ignoring injunctions on missile launches levied by the United Nations but not actually included in the nuclear agreement itself. None of these appear to constitute a material breach of the agreement. The problem the United States faces is not Iranian compliance, but the very terms of the agreement. Mr. Trump isn’t wrong when he says it’s a “bad deal.” It’s too narrow in scope, permitting Iran to work on its missile and centrifuge technology even while uranium enrichment is paused. More worrying, it’s only temporary. Some of its strictures begin to phase out in less than a decade, during which time Tehran can expand its power in the Middle East, just as the United States’ tools for trying to keep it in check — in particular, sanctions — are limited. But like it or not, the clock is not so easily turned back. Any realistic Iran policy must take this as its starting point. Rather than ripping up the deal or simply acquiescing to it, the Trump administration should strengthen both the deal and the policy framework of which it is a part. Stability on the issue of the nuclear agreement will eliminate a distraction and create leverage to rally international support for a better Middle East strategy. That’s why the United States should work with allies to more strictly interpret the existing text of the accord. Along with Britain, France and Germany — sometimes known as the E.U.3 — the United States should close any loopholes being exploited by Iran, increase intelligence cooperation on Iran’s nuclear activities and push international inspectors to interpret their mandate more broadly. These allies should also agree to enforce United Nations rules that aren’t included in the agreement, like those strictly limiting Iran’s arms trade. Working with these same allies, the United States should also tackle issues omitted from the nuclear deal, like Iran’s missile program. Through a package of sanctions, export controls, interdictions and missile defense, they should aim to prevent Iran from acquiring an intercontinental ballistic missile and from continuing to export missile technology. The United States and the E.U.3 should also address the problem of the nuclear deal’s expiration date by jointly declaring now that they intend to expand and extend the agreement, rather than allow Iran’s nuclear activities to suddenly increase when it expires. In parallel, they should seek to strengthen global nonproliferation efforts so that even if nuclear restrictions specific to Iran cannot be extended, Tehran faces more challenges to weaponization when the deal does lapse. All of this must go hand in hand with a larger strategy to counter Iranian aggression in the Middle East. Iran’s leaders appear to be increasingly self-confident, perceiving success in Syria , Iraq and Yemen . And Iran is steadily expanding its network of proxies . To reverse these trends, the United States must move from generalities about countering Iran to specific aims — for example, preventing Iranian forces from entrenching in the Golan Heights , or deterring the use of anti-ship cruise missiles in the Bab el Mandeb Strait off Yemen’s coast. American officials need to communicate these boundaries to Iran and back them up with a range of tools, including sanctions, diplomacy and limited military force if necessary. These measures require help from America’s allies, who are not eager to fiddle with the nuclear agreement or face up to the problem of Iran’s regional policies. This is where diplomacy comes in. Allies in Europe and elsewhere know the deal is controversial in Washington, and they take seriously Mr. Trump’s threats to stop honoring it. Policy makers in Washington should make clear that their allies’ cooperation with efforts to strengthen the deal and counter Iran are required to avoid that outcome. The United States cannot subordinate its entire policy toward Iran or the Middle East to the preservation of the nuclear accord. And it shouldn’t shoulder sole responsibility for addressing Iran’s threats while Europe enjoys the deal’s benefits. Even then, this would constitute only the start of a policy for addressing the challenge of Iran. Iran is adept at exploiting chaos, which is endemic in the Middle East. Washington will need sound approaches to the wars in Syria and Yemen, Iraq’s fragility and other regional challenges like the fight between Qatar and its neighbors . But none of this will be possible if there is an international crisis every time there’s a new deadline for certifying compliance or waiving sanctions.

"European Leaders Criticize Trump’s Disavowal of Iran Deal","Advertisement Supported by By  Stephen Castle and Thomas Erdbrink LONDON — Iran, Russia and European leaders roundly condemned President Trump’s decision on Friday to disavow the Iran nuclear deal , saying that it reflected the growing isolation of the United States, threatened to destabilize the Middle East and could make it harder to resolve the growing tensions on the Korean Peninsula. The reaction was far from panicked, as Mr. Trump’s decision punts to Congress the critical decision of whether the United States will reimpose sanctions on Iran — a step that would effectively sink the deal. But Mr. Trump also warned that unless the nuclear agreement was altered and made permanent — to prohibit Iran from ever developing nuclear weapons — he would terminate the agreement, an ultimatum that threw the future of the accord into question. Though they avoided direct criticism of Mr. Trump, Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Emmanuel Macron of France said in a rare joint statement that they “stand committed” to the 2015 nuclear deal and that preserving it was “in our shared national security interest.” “The nuclear deal was the culmination of 13 years of diplomacy and was a major step towards ensuring that Iran’s nuclear program is not diverted for military purposes,” they added. Sigmar Gabriel, Germany’s foreign minister, said that Mr. Trump was sending “a difficult and also from our point of view dangerous signal.” He said that the Iran deal, and other diplomatic achievements, were necessary “to convince countries like North Korea, and maybe also others, that it is possible to create security without acquiring nuclear weapons.” “Destroying this agreement would, worldwide, mean that others could no longer rely on such agreements — that’s why it is a danger that goes further than Iran,” he added. Reaction from Iran was quick and pointed. Appearing on television, its president, Hassan Rouhani, denounced Mr. Trump and called the United States an outlier that had become “more lonely than ever” in the international community. Mr. Rouhani did not threaten to withdraw from the deal, but made it clear that he would not renegotiate the terms, either. “The statements of Mr. Trump are nothing but abuse and threats against the people of Iran,” he said. “An international agreement cannot be disregarded.” The European leaders noted that the United Nations Security Council had unanimously endorsed the deal, and that the International Atomic Energy Agency had confirmed Iran’s compliance with it. But Mr. Trump’s aggressive stance on Iran won plaudits from several nations on Friday, specifically from adversaries of Iran like Israel, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister who has always opposed the agreement with Iran, said that Mr. Trump’s announcement created “an opportunity to fix this bad deal” and was a sign of Mr. Trump’s determination to “boldly confront Iran’s terrorist regime.” Saudi Arabia, which has waged a proxy battle against Iran for supremacy in the region and was the first country Mr. Trump visited after taking office, said it welcomed what it called a “new U.S. strategy” toward Iran. The United Arab Emirates, which like Saudi Arabia is a predominantly Sunni Muslim country with a sizable Shiite minority, also said that it “fully supports” Mr. Trump’s stance on Iran. Some leaders declared that the deal, reached in 2015 between Iran and six world powers, including the United States, was not something that Mr. Trump could cancel, contending that Mr. Trump was essentially putting on a show for his political base. “The president of the United States has many powers — not this one,” the European Union’s top diplomat, Federica Mogherini, said at a news conference in Brussels. She said that there had been no violations of the agreement and that the world could not afford to dismantle an accord that “is working and delivering,” especially at a time of “acute nuclear threat,” referring to the standoff with North Korea over its nuclear program. Criticism of the nuclear deal was a central theme of Mr. Trump’s candidacy for president, and he has repeatedly called for revisiting what he sees as a fatally flawed agreement. Mr. Trump said on Friday that under the current deal “Iran can sprint” toward the development of nuclear weapons when the deal’s restrictions expire. Some of the prohibitions in the agreement are set to end in 2025, including limits on the number of its centrifuges. Iran, which has always maintained that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, not for weapons, would not agree to a permanent freeze in its ability to enrich nuclear fuel. That must be changed, Mr. Trump said, or he would scrap the deal altogether. Russia, which took part in the negotiations to reach the accord and has warned Mr. Trump not to rescind it, said that the president had no basis for disavowing the deal. “Iran is abiding” by the nuclear agreement, Mikhail Ulyanov, a director at the Russian foreign ministry, told the Interfax news agency. “Everyone agrees with that. And an attempt to somehow heighten the tensions in this situation looks like unmotivated aggression.” In blunt language, Ms. Mogherini, the European Union’s top diplomat, essentially looked past Mr. Trump and appealed to Congress directly. America’s next step “is now in the hands of the United States Congress,” she said. “The international community and the European Union with it has clearly indicated that the deal is and will continue to be in place.” Russia urged American lawmakers to preserve the deal as well. “We want to hope that Congress will not take any dramatic steps which would effectively signify a collapse” of the deal, Russia’s deputy foreign minister told Interfax, referring to the renewed sanctions that might lead Iran to nullify the accord. In his remarks, Mr. Trump accused Iran of violating both the letter and the spirit of the accord. But Iran has accused the United States of doing the same, and on Friday its mission to the United Nations warned that Iran might itself back away from the deal. “Iran has many options on how to proceed and if necessary will terminate its commitment regarding this issue,” the mission said in a statement, without elaborating. Iran has also resisted the idea of renegotiating the nuclear agreement in the West’s favor. Last month, its foreign minister rejected extending the length or conditions of the accord, saying that Iran would consider changing the agreement only if the concessions it had already made — including giving up nuclear fuel — were reconsidered. There are fears that the basic framework of the accord could collapse if the United States walks away. Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, told reporters on Friday that Russia believed Iran would abandon the deal if the United States did.

"Trump Vandalizes the Iran Deal","Advertisement Supported by By  Nicholas Kristof Opinion Columnist President Trump’s attempt to blow up the Iranian nuclear deal isn’t foreign policy. It’s vandalism. Trump is abandoning the Iran deal, with nothing to replace it, even though his own secretary of state and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff say that Iran appears to be in compliance; even though his own secretary of defense says that staying in the deal is in America’s interest; even though our allies are pleading to stick with it. The reason for Trump’s decision seems obvious: The deal was President Barack Obama’s. This petty retreat from diplomacy is the most significant national security move Trump has made. It means that Trump is isolating the United States, not Iran, and it increases the risk of military conflict down the road. If there’s anything we should have learned, it’s to avoid unnecessary wars in the Middle East — but Trump may be laying the groundwork for yet another. “Many regard the invasion of Iraq as the worst foreign policy move in the history of the American republic,” James Dobbins, a much respected retired diplomat, tweeted after Trump’s speech. “Now we have a competitor.” The Iranian deal may not permanently solve the problem of Iran’s pursuit of nuclear weapons, but it delays any crisis for nearly 15 years or more. Trump doesn’t want to risk a possible crisis then, so he chooses to have one now — apparently, just for the satisfaction of kicking sand at Obama. A crisis won’t necessarily result right away. It could be some months before sanctions would actually kick in, and in any case Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said this week that the nuclear deal could remain in place even if the Americans pull out. Rather, Iran may try for moderation to peel European allies away from America — and Trump is playing into this Iranian strategy. Some in the international community will regard the actions of President Trump and of Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, and see Khamenei as more of a statesman. Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seems to be itching for a joint American-Israeli strike on Iran. Netanyahu may see political advantages to a triumphant airstrike, and I fear Trump might as well. Trump may have absorbed the unfortunate lesson from his military strikes on Syria that when he fires missiles, he is hailed as presidential. I’m told that the United States years ago secretly built a replica of the Iranian complex at Fordo, which is deep underground to protect it from bombings, and practiced striking it with new munitions to see whether it could be destroyed. Based on those tests, America could indeed destroy Fordo — and that will give hawks in the Trump administration, like John Bolton, more confidence as they advocate military options down the road. Bolton is smart and knowledgeable, but his hawkish approach also has a track record. Let’s see how it did in three cases: First, Bolton agitated for the Iraq War and still considers the invasion to have been a wise decision. The war, remember, killed 4,500 Americans , about half a million Iraqis, and cost the U.S. some $3 trillion — or $24,000 per American household. Second, Bolton in 2002 helped kill the Agreed Framework that had kept North Korea from building a single nuclear warhead during the Clinton years. North Korea was secretly evading the framework, so tough negotiation was required — but instead Bolton helped blow up the deal, and since then North Korea has conducted six nuclear tests and developed intercontinental missiles that can reach the U.S. Third, Bolton in 2003 and 2004 helped end a European initiative to reach a deal with Iran on nuclear issues at that time, when the program was in much earlier stages. In each of these cases, Bolton and the hawks were right that diplomacy was a flawed tool and might not have achieved our objectives: In international relations, there are more problems than solutions. What is clear is that the hawkish non-diplomatic paths failed catastrophically. A basic problem with military options is that, as the Prussian strategist Helmuth Von Moltke observed, no military plan survives first contact with the enemy. After a strike, Iran might try to blow up Saudi oil installations, or block oil exports through the Strait of Hormuz, or it could use its proxies in Lebanon to stir up a war with Israel. I’ve reported in Iran ( and been detained there by secret police and accused of spying), and I know full well that the regime is untrustworthy. That’s precisely the reason for the nuclear deal and the rigorous inspections that come with it. For now, the inspectors agree that Iran is essentially in compliance — while the U.S. arguably violated it by failing to approve licenses for commerce with Iran, and by subverting normal trade relations. So why destroy a deal that is working, other than to dismantle some of Obama’s legacy? “What’s the purpose of all this?” asked Jake Sullivan, a former senior State Department official involved in the outreach to Iran. “You put pressure back on, and what’s the purpose? Is it to achieve a new nuclear deal? Is it about regime change?” Sullivan noted that there’s little chance of Trump actually negotiating a new deal, and added: “So what’s the point of this other than ‘Iranians are bad people and we’re going to hurt them.’ What’s the strategy other than a temper tantrum?” And that’s why I see Trump’s move as less about foreign policy than about vandalism.

"President Obama Calls Preliminary Iran Nuclear Deal ‘Our Best Bet’","Advertisement Supported by By  Peter Baker WASHINGTON — President Obama strongly defended last week’s preliminary agreement with Iran as a “once in a lifetime opportunity” to curb the spread of nuclear weapons in a dangerous region while reassuring critics that he would keep all options available if Tehran ultimately cheated. As he sought in an interview with The New York Times to sell the tentative deal to skeptics accusing him of giving away too much, Mr. Obama emphasized to Israel that “we’ve got their backs” in the face of Iranian hostility. And he suggested that he could accept some sort of vote in Congress if it did not block his ability to carry out the agreement. “This is our best bet by far to make sure Iran doesn’t get a nuclear weapon,” Mr. Obama said in an interview with Thomas L. Friedman , an Op-Ed columnist for The Times, published on Sunday. “What we will be doing even as we enter into this deal is sending a very clear message to the Iranians and to the entire region that if anybody messes with Israel, America will be there.” In the interview, held Saturday, Mr. Obama provided new details about how international inspectors would try to access suspected covert nuclear sites and about the sequence that would lead to sanctions being lifted. Both were major issues in the last days of negotiations in Switzerland, and Mr. Obama’s descriptions differed in key respects from Iran’s interpretations. That gap suggested the hardest moments in the negotiations may yet be ahead, given that commitments made last week must still be enshrined in a written document signed by all parties by June 30. But Mr. Obama seemed to gain breathing space as Republicans signaled they would give him until then to see what the final deal looks like before directly intervening. The president’s comments came as the White House embarked on a campaign to sell a preliminary agreement that he hopes will transform security in the Middle East. Under the framework, negotiated with the United States and five other world powers, Iran agreed to scale back its nuclear program significantly for 10 to 15 years and accept intense international inspections. In exchange, the United States and the international community would lift sanctions that have punished the Iranian economy. While in theory preventing Iran from being able to quickly build a bomb, the agreement leaves it with a nuclear program in place, even if much diminished, drawing criticism from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and Republican leaders in Congress as well as skepticism from Arab allies and many Democrats. “Not a single centrifuge is destroyed,” Mr. Netanyahu said Sunday on “State of the Union” on CNN. “Not a single nuclear facility is shut down, including the underground facilities that they build illicitly. Thousands of centrifuges will keep spinning, enriching uranium. That’s a very bad deal.” Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a possible Republican presidential candidate, said it was “probably the best deal that Barack Obama could get with the Iranians because the Iranians don’t fear” him. “Hillary Clinton could do better,” he added, as could all the Republican candidates, “except maybe Rand Paul.” But Mr. Graham said he would wait to see how the final agreement looked. “I don’t mind giving the administration the time between now and June to put this deal together,” he said on “Face the Nation” on CBS. In the interview, the president struck a conciliatory note after weeks of open tension with Mr. Netanyahu, a clash that has worried even some White House advisers. Mr. Obama said “I respect” Mr. Netanyahu’s security argument and agreed that Israelis “have every right to be concerned about Iran,” a country that has threatened “to destroy Israel, that has denied the Holocaust, that has expressed venomous anti-Semitic ideas.” Whether Iran is racing toward nuclear weapon capabilities is one of the most contentious foreign-policy issues challenging the West. He pledged to redouble support for Israeli security. “I would consider it a failure on my part, a fundamental failure of my presidency, if on my watch, or as a consequence of work that I had done, Israel was rendered more vulnerable,” he said. Similarly, he said he wanted to use a meeting he has called at Camp David to “formalize” security aid for Arab allies threatened by Iran. While still resisting what he deemed congressional interference, Mr. Obama reached out to Republicans, calling Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, a “good and decent man.” He did not embrace Mr. Corker’s legislation to give Congress the right to approve or reject the deal. But when asked about a nonbinding vote, the president appeared supportive. “My hope is that we can find something that allows Congress to express itself but does not encroach on traditional presidential prerogatives and ensures that if in fact we get a good deal that we can go ahead and implement it,” Mr. Obama said. Mr. Corker, appearing on “Fox News Sunday,” immediately rejected the idea of a nonbinding vote. “There is strong bipartisan support for a binding vote by Congress,” he said. “Look, the president needs to sell this to the American people, and Congress needs to be involved in this way.” Under the agreement, Iran would limit enrichment of uranium at its Natanz facility to a level useful only for civilian purposes; cut back the number of installed centrifuges by approximately two-thirds; convert its Fordo deep-underground enrichment facility into a research center; and modify its Arak heavy-water reactor to render it incapable of producing plutonium for a bomb. But the structure of international inspections was left vague, as was the timing for lifting sanctions. Mr. Obama said that inspectors would be able to watch “the entire nuclear chain” and that a “procurement committee” would examine Iranian imports to be sure equipment would be appropriate for peaceful nuclear uses, not a weapon. Inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency, he said, “can go anyplace.” But the administration has been vague about how to define “anyplace,” and Iran has said it would not be required to allow inspections of military bases. “Iran could object,” Mr. Obama acknowledged, “but what we have done is to try to design a mechanism whereby once those objections are heard, that is not a final veto that Iran has but in fact some sort of international mechanism will be in place that makes a fair assessment.” Mr. Obama said sanctions would be lifted only after Iran lived up to its commitments. “There are still details to be worked out,” he said, “but I think that the basic framework calls for Iran to take the steps that it needs to around Fordo, the centrifuges and so forth. At that point, then the U.N. sanctions are suspended.” A guide to help you navigate the deal between global powers and Tehran. He said the United States would “preserve the ability to snap back those sanctions if there is a violation.” And he added that separate sanctions imposed for other reasons, namely Iran’s sponsorship of terrorists and its ballistic missile program, would remain in place. Administration officials said they envisioned Iran being able to take the required steps within months or a year of an agreement, at which point nuclear-related economic sanctions would be removed. But a major sticking point in the coming months will be the issue of additional sanctions imposed for other reasons. Mr. Obama said almost nothing about how the United States and its allies would force Iran to answer questions about suspected past work on weapons designs. For years, Iran has blocked inspectors from visiting laboratories where such work is believed to have been conducted. Mr. Obama presented the nuclear agreement in broader terms. He admitted that he remained uncertain about the intentions of the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, with whom he has exchanged letters. “He’s a pretty tough read,” Mr. Obama said. The ayatollah’s letters, he said, are filled with “a lot of reminders of what he perceives as past grievances against Iran.” But Mr. Obama said it was telling that the ayatollah allowed his negotiators to make concessions, and he held out hope that the agreement would empower more moderate figures, although he said he was not counting on it. “Who knows?” he added. “Iran may change.” But if not, he said, the United States retains “the most firepower” to address any contingencies. “It’s not as if in all these conversations, I’m leaving all my, you know, rifles at the door,” he said. Asked about an Obama Doctrine, he said: “The doctrine is we will engage, but we preserve all our capabilities. And I’ve been very clear that Iran will not get a nuclear weapon on my watch, and I think they should understand that we mean it. But I say that hoping that we can conclude this diplomatic arrangement and that it ushers in a new era in U.S.-Iranian relations.” David E. Sanger contributed reporting. Opinion Thomas L.

"Iran's Revolutionary Guards commander supports nuclear deal with west","Mohammad Ali Jafari is the latest top Iranian figure to come out in support of tentative Lausanne agreement as room for criticism grows tighter  Tue 7 Apr 2015 20.04 BST   Last modified on Tue 7 Apr 2015 20.41 BST   The commander of Iran’s powerful Revolutionary Guards has expressed support for the framework agreement that emerged from last week’s nuclear negotiations in Switzerland, a strong indication that senior officials in Tehran, especially those in the military, are backing the ongoing talks. Mohammad Ali Jafari was the latest of an increasing number of top Iranian figures who have come out in support of the Lausanne tentative agreement which provides the basis for a more comprehensive deal. Under its terms, Tehran has agreed to dramatically roll back its nuclear programme in return for the lifting of economic sanctions. “With God’s grace, the revolutionary children of Islamic Iran have succeeded in defending the rights of the Iranian nation and the Iranian nation and the Revolutionary Guards appreciate their honest political efforts,” Jafari said on Tuesday, according to the local news agencies. Although the man with the highest authority in Iran, supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has not yet issued his verdict of the preliminary agreement, comments from members of his inner circle suggest that they are trying to prepare their hardline core for the leader’s support. Other prominent officials who have backed the agreement include Hassan Firouzabadi, the Iranian armed forces’ chief of staff, and Ali Larjani, the speaker of the parliament. Jafari said he was confident the country’s negotiating team, which is led by its foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, did not cross the red lines laid out by the ruling establishment, meaning that the concessions made in the nuclear talks were approved by senior officials. Iran has always maintained that its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes and rejects any notion that it might have had a military dimension in the past. But the west suspects that Tehran, especially Jafari’s elite forces, might still have or once had military ambitions for that programme. Jafari’s remarks show that his forces support a compromise to find a way out of a decades-long dispute, which isolated Iran and badly hit its economy. Zarif and his team returned to Tehran from Lausanne, Switzerland, to a hero’s welcome last week as a crowd gathered at the airport to greet them. The foreign minister also appeared on the state television for a lengthy interview in which he was questioned about the differences between an American fact-sheet, distributed by the White House about the key parameters of the deal, and an Iranian version. Despite the differences, the two sides do not seem to have contradicted each other but merely given more weight to the parameters they wanted to highlight to their respective domestic audiences. The US fact-sheet speaks little about the lifting of sanctions and the timetable set out for it while the Iranian version is ambiguous about the level to which Iran will have to cut its programme. Zarif and the head of Iran’s atomic energy agency, Ali Akbar Salehi, also went on Tuesday to the parliament, which is dominated by conservatives, to discuss the negotiations. As Zarif briefed Iranian MPs in a closed session of the parliament, a group of people, among them clerics, gathered outside in protest at the agreement with placards criticising the terms of the preliminary deal. A number of MPs have also been critical of the recent outcome of the talks, believing that Tehran has given away too much for too little. But in the wake of high-level supports, such as that of Jafari, the room for criticism is likely to become tighter. The hardline Iranian editor and commentator Hossein Shariatmadari, who had complained a few days ago that “we gave them a saddled horse and they gave back some broken reins”, took a less critical view on Tuesday, saying he backed Iranian negotiators but believed the talks still needed a minor “tonsil surgery”. A small but isolated number of critics have remained vocal. Mahmoud Nabavian, a member of the parliament for the capital Tehran, recently gave a long speech in which he took a thorough review of the American fact-sheet, accusing the country’s negotiators of not saying all the real truths about the agreement to people at home."
"Iran’s Supreme Leader Says Sanctions Must Lift When Nuclear Deal Is Signed","Advertisement Supported by By  Thomas Erdbrink and David E. Sanger TEHRAN — Iran ’s supreme leader on Thursday challenged two of the United States’ bedrock principles in the nuclear negotiations, declaring that all economic sanctions would have to be lifted on the day any final agreement was signed and that military sites would be strictly off limits to foreign inspectors. The assertions by the leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , could be tactical, intended to give both the negotiators and himself some political space to get Iran’s hard-liners accustomed to the framework of the nuclear deal reached a week ago with the United States and other world powers. But they sharply illustrated the difficult hurdles that lie ahead as Secretary of State John Kerry and a large team of diplomats, energy experts and intelligence officials try to reach a June 30 deadline that would ensure that Iran could not race for a bomb for at least a decade — and would establish a permanent inspection regime to catch any cheating. In his remarks, Ayatollah Khamenei added several stinging criticisms of Iran’s regional competitor, Saudi Arabia — calling its new leaders “inexperienced youths” — a sign of rising regional tensions that could pose another threat to the negotiations, even as diplomats strive to keep the issues on separate tracks. King Salman, the country’s newly installed leader, is 79, though many around him are a generation younger. Saudi Arabia is currently allied with the United States against Iran in the developing civil war in Yemen, which is fast becoming a major source of regional instability. Mr. Kerry accused Tehran this week of direct military support to the rebels there and warned Tehran to back off. Ayatollah Khamenei’s comments were the first time he has discussed the framework that emerged from the nuclear talks last week in Lausanne, Switzerland. His pronouncements are considered vital because they shape the “red lines” for Iranian negotiators, though they have often showed considerable flexibility in working out details that seem to adhere to his literal meaning while still accommodating some Western demands. For example, he had previously required that no nuclear facilities could be closed, but under the framework accord one of them — Fordo, a deep underground enrichment site — is being converted to a research center where fissile material is banned. Another, a heavy-water reactor, is being redesigned to prevent it from making bomb-grade plutonium. On Tuesday night the director of the C.I.A., John O. Brennan, said he believed Ayatollah Khamenei had been persuaded, over the past two years, that an accord was necessary to avoid an economic free fall in Iran. But the ayatollah himself said Thursday that he saw no need to make a clear pronouncement on the deal because no signed agreement yet existed. But he emphasized his longstanding position about the sanctions, saying that they “should be lifted all together on the same day of the agreement, not six months or one year later.” The Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, who spoke at a different event on Thursday, echoed the supreme leader’s remarks but with a potentially crucial difference, saying the sanctions have to be lifted on the day a deal is put in place, potentially months after a signed agreement. “We will not sign any agreement unless all economic sanctions are totally lifted on the first day of the implementation of the deal,” Mr. Rouhani said during a ceremony for Iran’s nuclear technology day, which celebrates the country’s nuclear achievements. While the June 30 deadline is still months away, the ayatollah’s comments pose some significant potential challenges to Mr. Kerry and his negotiating team. Mr. Kerry and President Obama have been saying that sanctions would be suspended in phases, as Iran complied with its obligations. That is critical to American leverage in making sure that Iran follows through on its commitments to vastly reduce its uranium stockpile — a process that will take months, if not longer — and decommissions centrifuges, placing them in storage. On Wednesday night, on the “PBS NewsHour,” Mr. Kerry said that in any final agreement, Iran would also have to resolve outstanding questions with the International Atomic Energy Agency over suspected military dimensions of the nuclear program . “It will be part of a final agreement,” he said. “It has to be.” American and Iranian officials are using different words to describe elements of the preliminary agreement to limit Iran’s nuclear program. Mr. Kerry’s assurances did little to mollify the deal’s many congressional critics, who pounced on Ayatollah Khamenei’s comments as proof that the nuclear deal is unworkable. “As each new day reveals a new disagreement, it’s increasingly clear that Iran, in fact, failed to reach agreement with the United States and its partners on a political framework that addresses all parameters of a comprehensive agreement,” said Senator Mark Kirk, Republican of Illinois. who has led an effort to impose new sanctions on Iran — a step President Obama says is clearly intended to blow up any progress that has been made. In his remarks Thursday, Ayatollah Khamenei seemed to rule out any inspections inside military bases or compounds. That could become problematic. While Mr. Obama and Mr. Kerry have said the inspection requirements they have negotiated would be among the most intrusive in history, they have not said whether they would extend to military sites. Several of the sites the United States is most concerned about in Iran are on military bases, including Fordo. Inspectors have visited the site regularly, and the atomic energy agency has, periodically, been allowed onto other military bases. Similarly, the timing of sanctions relief is far more complicated than simply setting a date. Even with cooperation from the Iranian side, the technical issues are so complex that agency officials say resolving them will be a lengthy process. As Iran and world powers including the United States try to reach a deal on nuclear controls in exchange for the lifting of sanctions, Iranians from all walks of life are watching and hoping for a new start. Mr. Obama can suspend some of the United States sanctions with the stroke of a pen, but actually terminating them would require congressional action. Other sanctions are based on United Nations Security Council resolutions. Mr. Kerry said in Lausanne last week that under a final deal, if one is reached, a new set of resolutions would be passed, ending many of the sanctions but keeping proliferation controls in place. Even if sanctions are legally eliminated, major corporate players may initially be reluctant to do business in Iran. Banks have been heavily fined for violations and would want assurances about the new rules. Investors may fear that sanctions could “snap back” if there was a dispute between Iran and the West, leaving their investments stranded. Ayatollah Khamenei may have thrown another new factor into the equation by suggesting there was plenty of time to consider a deal and review the actions of opponents, and said the deadline of June 30 was in no way sacred. “They might say that we have only three months left. Well, if three months becomes four months the sky won’t come falling down,” he said. “Just as the other side pushed the negotiations back by seven months,” he added, referring to an extension decided in November. A guide to help you navigate the deal between global powers and Tehran. However, June 30 is the date at which the current extension of negotiations runs out. So unless it is renewed — something both sides have previously rejected — the temporary limits on Iran’s enrichment activities will terminate that day. And after June 30, Congress has threatened to impose new sanctions if a satisfactory deal is not in place. Ayatollah Khamenei did not criticize those details of the framework that had already been agreed to, even though some of them, if put in place, would represent big compromises from all parties, including Iran. He repeated that while he was not optimistic about negotiating with world powers — especially with the United States — he did support the talks and Iran’s diplomatic team. “I have agreed to this particular instance of negotiations and I support the negotiators,” Ayatollah Khamenei said, according to his official website, Khamenei.ir . In recent days, almost all major figures in the Iranian establishment have come out in support of the framework agreement , while adding the usual caveat that Iran’s rights must be guaranteed. Most, including Friday Prayer leaders and military commanders, have said they supported the talks. Yet, speaking to an audience of religious chanters in his Tehran office, the ayatollah said the government should allow critics of the deal to speak their minds, “as it will help unity” in the country. It must be clear, the ayatollah said, that the negotiations were not going beyond the nuclear field. “But,” he continued, “if the other side refrains from its normal bad actions, this will become an experience that we can continue on other issues. If we see that once again they repeat their bad actions, it will only strengthen our experience of not trusting America.” With the ayatollah’s unusually strong remarks about the Saudis on Thursday, the sectarian-tinged fighting in Yemen seemed potentially to be developing into yet another wedge between Washington and Tehran.

"Iran's Ayatollah Ali Khamenei: no guarantee of final nuclear deal","Supreme leader strikes cautious note, saying he neither backs nor rejects framework deal negotiated in Lausanne  Thu 9 Apr 2015 18.14 BST   First published on Thu 9 Apr 2015 13.58 BST   Iran’s supreme leader has stopped short of endorsing last week’s tentative agreement on Tehran’s nuclear programme, saying he neither backs nor rejects it. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei described the framework deal as non-binding and insisted there was no guarantee a final deal would be struck. Speaking for the first time in public since the talks in Lausanne concluded , Khamenei said he supported a deal that preserved the “honour” of his country and that the details of the final agreement would be decisive. But he said no deal was better than a bad deal. The French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, said Khamenei’s remarks showed there was still a lot of work to be done before diplomats from Iran and six world major powers could agree on a comprehensive deal, currently facing an end-of-June deadline. Khamenei, who has the final say in all state matters and has usually taken a pessimistic view on nuclear negotiations, was addressing a crowd of his followers in Tehran on the occasion of Iran’s national day for nuclear technology. He said he would not interfere in the details of the talks, but made clear that two issues remain as red lines for him: that sanctions should be lifted immediately after a final agreement is struck and that the west should not gain access to the country’s military sites. Under the framework agreement reached in Lausanne, which provides the basis for a more comprehensive deal, Tehran has agreed to dramatically roll back its nuclear programme in return for the lifting of economic sanctions. But Iran and the US have since released separate factsheets on the key parameters of that agreement, prompting debates in Tehran and Washington about the differences between the two interpretations. “Our officials say that nothing is done yet and there’s still nothing binding between the two sides. I’m neither for nor against it,” said the 75-year-old ayatollah. “It’s all about the details that they are yet to negotiate. The other side may want to stab us in the back over the details; it is too early for congratulations. “What has been done so far secures neither the main deal nor its contents. It is not even clear whether the talks will bear fruit and lead to an agreement ... But I will welcome a deal that preserves the honour of the Iranian people and we always say that no deal is better than a bad deal.” Khamenei said he was concerned about ongoing negotiations because he did not trust the other side. “The White House published a factsheet which was wrong on most of the issues. It distorted reality,” he said. “All sanctions should be removed just when the deal is reached. If sanctions removal depends on another process, then why did we start to talk?” he asked. He added that negotiations for a comprehensive agreement could be extended beyond the end of June if more time was needed. Fabius reacted by saying: “Subjects still remain that we aren’t agreed on, notably on economic sanctions, and the supreme leader has made statements that show there is still a lot of work to be done. “We are going to keep the position we have held from the beginning, which is constructive but extremely demanding … If it’s possible, we want an agreement, but it needs to ensure that nothing remains in the shadows.” Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, echoed Khamenei’s demand for the immediate lifting of sanctions if the comprehensive agreement was sealed. “We will not sign any agreements unless, on the first day of the implementation of the deal, all economic sanctions are totally lifted on the same day,” he said. An increasing number of senior Iranian officials, including some in Khamenei’s inner circle, such as the commander of the revolutionary guards , have come out in support of the talks, but critics, including hardline MPs, have not been shy to voice opposition. Since the preliminary agreement, Iran has allowed an unprecedented degree of public debate between those who support the Iranian negotiators and others who say they have given away too much for too little. Iran’s foreign minister and chief nuclear negotiator, Mohammad Javad Zarif, has faced a particular grilling from state television and MPs over the differences between the American factsheet and the version promoted inside Iran. The US factsheet speaks little about the lifting of sanctions and the timetable set out for it, while the Iranian version is ambiguous about the level to which Iran will have to cut its programme."
"Iran's foreign minister accuses Europe of appeasing Trump","Mohammad Javad Zarif says Europeans bowing to pressure in order to keep US in nuclear deal  Saeed Kamali Dehghan Iran correspondent  Mon 5 Mar 2018 16.59 GMT   Last modified on Thu 5 Jul 2018 21.46 BST   Iran’s foreign minister has accused Europe of appeasing Donald Trump as the French foreign minister travelled to Tehran in an effort to salvage the 2015 nuclear agreement. In an interview with an Iranian newspaper published before his meeting with Jean-Yves Le Drian on Monday, Mohammad Javad Zarif chastised European countries for bowing to pressure from Washington and said concerns about Iran’s missile programme or its role in the Middle East were hypocritical and dangerous. “In order to keep the US in the Iran nuclear deal , European countries are resorting to extremism … [we] will not remain indifferent,” Zarif told the reformist Etemaad daily in a front-page interview printed under the headline “Europe will regret”. The genesis of Trump’s particular antipathy to Iran is hard to pin down.  Before entering office he had been sceptical of Iran’s regional rival, Saudi Arabia. But during the 2016 election campaign all his closest foreign policy advisors, such as Michael Flynn, shared a worldview that portrays Iran as an uniquely malign actor in the Middle East and beyond. After the election, Israel, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates were successful in capturing the ear of Trump and his son-in-law and top adviser Jared Kushner. Trump refused last year to certify Iran’s compliance to the nuclear accord but he has so far stopped short of cancelling US participation in the deal, which promised to loosen sanctions in exchange for curbs to Tehran’s nuclear programme. In January he reluctantly waived a raft of sanctions against Iran as required by the US Congress every 120 days, but warned this was “a last chance” and asked “European countries to join with the United States in fixing significant flaws in the deal”. Trump has vowed not to waive the sanctions again unless Europeans managed to make radical changes to the nuclear deal, including curbs on Iran’s missile development. The missile programme is not covered by the deal, and Tehran says it will not bow to pressure to halt it. “At present, two groups have violated the nuclear deal: the United States and Europe. The Americans because of Washington’s policy and the Europeans because of the US policy,” Zarif said. Although all nuclear-related sanctions were lifted in January 2016, Iran is not benefiting, mainly because top European banks, fearful of Washington, remain wary of doing business with the country. The banking issue is preventing Iran from capitalising on huge foreign investment interest shown in the past few years. The Iranian embassy in London has faced obstacles in opening a bank account in the UK and in a recent example of frustration despite the removal of sanctions, Munich airport companies refused to refuel Zarif’s aeroplane while he was attending a prominent security conference last month. On Monday the International Atomic Energy Agency chief, Yukiya Amano, said Tehran was fulfilling its obligations and warned “it would be a great loss for nuclear verification and for multilateralism” if the framework of the nuclear deal were to collapse. Zarif’s interview appeared a day after Le Drian gave an interview to a French weekly in which he said Tehran risked “exposing itself to new sanctions” if it remained reluctant to discuss its missile programme. A group of hardliners gathered at Tehran airport to protest against his visit, and newspaper front pages in Iran criticised him. “French foreign minister insults people of Iran before visit to Tehran,” said a headline of the ultra-conservative Keyhan daily. The Javan newspaper carried the headline “Trump’s Parisian lackey in Tehran”. A poll conducted by IranPoll in collaboration with the University of Maryland, published last month, showed 92% of Iranian respondents believed the US was trying to preventing Iran from normalising its trade and economic relations, with 58% saying Iran should retaliate by restarting the aspects of its nuclear programme it agreed to suspend under the deal."
"Trump Was Outfoxed in Singapore","Advertisement Supported by By  Nicholas Kristof Opinion Columnist It sure looks as if President Trump was hoodwinked in Singapore. Trump made a huge concession — the suspension of military exercises with South Korea. That’s on top of the broader concession of the summit meeting itself, security guarantees he gave North Korea and the legitimacy that the summit provides his counterpart, Kim Jong-un. Within North Korea, the “very special bond” that Trump claimed to have formed with Kim will be portrayed this way: Kim forced the American president, through his nuclear and missile tests, to accept North Korea as a nuclear equal, to provide security guarantees to North Korea, and to cancel war games with South Korea that the North has protested for decades. In exchange for these concessions, Trump seems to have won astonishingly little. In a joint statement, Kim merely “reaffirmed” the same commitment to denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula that North Korea has repeatedly made since 1992. “They were willing to de-nuke,” Trump crowed at his news conference after his meetings with Kim. Trump seemed to believe he had achieved some remarkable agreement, but the concessions were all his own. The most remarkable aspect of the joint statement was what it didn’t contain. There was nothing about North Korea freezing plutonium and uranium programs, nothing about destroying intercontinental ballistic missiles, nothing about allowing inspectors to return to nuclear sites, nothing about North Korea making a full declaration of its nuclear program, nothing about a timetable, nothing about verification, not even any clear pledge to permanently halt testing of nuclear weapons or long-range missiles. Kim seems to have completely out-negotiated Trump, and it’s scary that Trump doesn’t seem to realize this. For now Trump has much less to show than past negotiators who hammered out deals with North Korea like the 1994 Agreed Framework, which completely froze the country’s plutonium program with a rigorous monitoring system. Trump made a big deal in his news conference about recovering the remains of American soldiers from the Korean War, but this is nothing new. Back in 1989, on my first trip to North Korea, officials there made similar pledges about returning remains, and indeed North Korea has returned some remains over the years. It’s not clear how many more remain. Trump claimed an “excellent relationship” with Kim, and it certainly is better for the two leaders to be exchanging compliments rather than missiles. In a sense, Trump has eased the tensions that he himself created when he threatened last fall to “totally destroy” North Korea. I’m just not sure a leader should get credit for defusing a crisis that he himself created. There’s still plenty we don’t know and lots of uncertainty about the future. But for now, the bottom line is that there’s no indication that North Korea is prepared to give up its nuclear weapons, and Trump didn’t achieve anything remotely as good as the Iran nuclear deal, which led Iran to eliminate 98 percent of its enriched uranium . There was also something frankly weird about an American president savaging Canada’s prime minister one day and then embracing the leader of the most totalitarian country in the world. “He’s a very talented man,” Trump said of Kim. “I also learned that he loves his country very much.” In an interview with Voice of America , Trump said “I like him” and added: “He’s smart, loves his people, he loves his country.” Trump praised Kim in the news conference and, astonishingly, even adopted North Korean positions as his own, saying that the United States military exercises in the region are “provocative.” That’s a standard North Korean propaganda line. Likewise, Trump acknowledged that human rights in North Korea constituted a “rough situation,” but quickly added that “it’s rough in a lot of places, by the way.” (Note that a 2014 United Nations report stated that North Korean human rights violations do “not have any parallel in the contemporary world.”) Incredibly, Trump told Voice of America that he had this message for the North Korean people: “I think you have somebody that has a great feeling for them. He wants to do right by them and we got along really well.” It’s breathtaking to see an American president emerge as a spokesman for the dictator of North Korea. One can argue that my perspective is too narrow: That what counts in a broader sense is that the risk of war is much less today than it was a year ago, and North Korea has at least stopped its nuclear tests and missile tests. Fundamentally, Trump has abandoned bellicose rhetoric and instead embraced the longstanding Democratic position — that we should engage North Korea, even if the result isn’t immediate disarmament. The 1994 Agreed Framework, for example, didn’t denuclearize North Korea or solve the human rights issues there, but it still kept the regime from adding to its plutonium arsenal for eight years. Imperfect processes can still be beneficial, and the ongoing meetings between the United States and North Korea may result in a similar framework that at least freezes the North Korean arsenal. Of all the things that could have gone badly wrong in a Trump administration, a “bloody nose” strike on North Korea leading to a nuclear war was perhaps the most terrifying. For now at least, Trump seems to have been snookered into the same kind of deeply frustrating diplomatic process with North Korea that he has complained about, but that is far better than war. Even so, it’s still bewildering how much Trump gave and how little he got. The cancellation of military exercises will raise questions among our allies, such as Japan, about America’s commitment to those allies. The Trump-Kim statement spoke vaguely about efforts “to build a lasting and stable peace regime on the Korean peninsula,” whatever that means. But that was much less specific than the 1994 pledge to exchange diplomatic liaison offices, and the 2005 pledge to work for a peace treaty to end the Korean War. In January 2017, Trump proclaimed in a tweet: “North Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the U.S. It won’t happen!” But in fact it appears to have happened on Trump’s watch, and nothing in the Singapore summit seems to have changed that. All this is to say that Kim Jong-un proved the more able negotiator. North Korean government officials have to limit their computer time, because of electricity shortages, and they are international pariahs — yet they are very savvy and shrewd, and they were counseled by one of the smartest Trump handlers of all, President Moon Jae-in of South Korea. My guess is that Kim flattered Trump, as Moon has, and that Trump simply didn’t realize how little he was getting. On my most recent visit to North Korea, officials were asking me subtle questions about the differences in views of Mike Pompeo and Nikki Haley; meanwhile, Trump said he didn’t need to do much homework. Whatever our politics, we should all want Trump to succeed in reducing tensions on the Korean Peninsula, and it’s good to see that Trump now supports engagement rather than military options. There will be further negotiations, and these may actually freeze plutonium production and destroy missiles. But at least in the first round, Trump seems to have been snookered.

"By ending the nuclear deal, Trump has handed a gift to Iranian hardliners","One of the many knock-on effects of Trump’s decision to end the nuclear deal could be the victory of hardliners in elections  Tue 8 May 2018 23.57 BST   Last modified on Thu 5 Jul 2018 21.45 BST   For Iranians, Donald Trump’s announcement that he is withdrawing the US from the nuclear deal and reimposing sanctions, despite Iran’s compliance with the deal, is deeply disappointing. This is a manufactured crisis, and in making it, Washington and its allies in Tel Aviv and Riyadh have set their sights on a zero-sum option of containing and even forcing political change in the Islamic Republic. This naive thinking reflects Washington’s limited understanding of Iran and its internal politics as well as the deep regional divide between Iran and its Arab neighbours. So rather than address the principal challenge of Iran’s regional meddling and the wider tensions in the Middle East in an initiative separate from the already functioning nuclear deal, Trump has unleashed a genie that will not so easily go back in its bottle. The consequences and challenges ahead are multiple. Inside Iran, President Rouhani’s initial reaction was to translate Iranian anger and disappointment into nationalism First, the US withdrawal creates a transatlantic divide at a time when cooperation between Washington and its European allies is critical. Since January, France, Germany and the UK have scrambled to find solutions, albeit unsuccessfully, to placate Trump’s concerns about the nuclear agreement. Trump’s zero-sum decision, however, leaves the EU with little room for manoeuvre, either to save the deal or to create openings for new negotiations. In the absence of either, a full-scale collapse of the deal will ultimately empower China and Russia. Both will capitalise on western paralysis in the Middle East by building strong economic and political ties not only with Iran, who will have no where else to turn, but also its neighbours that are already looking east. Inside Iran, President Rouhani’s initial reaction was to translate Iranian anger and disappointment into nationalism. He immediately responded by summoning the “Iranian nation … to be more united and resolved.” But Trump has handed a unique opportunity to hardline political elites to build on Iranian frustration. Not only can the hardliners use the breakdown of the deal to establish unity among the divided elites, but they can also build bridges with the Iranian population after protests in January. The knock-on effects of conservative unity could even lead to a victory for a hardline candidate in the 2020 parliamentary elections and the 2021 presidential poll. Moving beyond symbolic speeches, though, Iran has a hard task ahead that includes trying to maintain European, Russian and Chinese solidarity. Without that Tehran faces renewed economic isolation. In the weeks ahead, Tehran will seek to pressure the EU in particular to defend the deal. If that defence does not materialise, though, Iran will gradually restart its nuclear programme. The wider consequence here is that other regional actors such as Saudi Arabia will also make similar moves accelerating the issue of regional nuclear proliferation. The Middle East is a tinderbox of tensions as conflicts rage in Syria, Yemen, Iraq and Lebanon and Iran is the driver of much of this toxicity. Here too, the potential for a wider regional escalation is high. Israel remains rightly intent on preventing Tehran from gaining a significant foothold on the Syrian border. Yet, Iran has developed asymmetrical ties with militias and proxies affording it great opportunity to stir up trouble and demonstrate its leverage. With these consequences in mind, it is clear that the Trump administration has miscalculated. While Trump is proud to have maintained his campaign promise to roll back the “worst deal ever”, he does not yet realise that by doing so he will be breaking another – and the United States could yet again become embroiled in another Middle East war."
"In Race for Global Power, U.S. and China Push Nations to Pick a Side","Advertisement Supported by By  Edward Wong and Alan Rappeport WASHINGTON — The escalating brinkmanship between the United States and China as they race to quash each other’s global influence is forcing other nations to pick sides between the two superpowers, putting at risk future cooperation on geopolitical threats and a resolution to the economic standoff. The  rivalry , which has reached a new pitch and scope, is now centered on the trade war that President Trump started this year. But tensions have also sharpened over a broad range of diplomatic and military issues, like Taiwan, the South China Sea and economic sanctions on North Korea and Iran . Across the globe, the United States and China are jockeying to build alliances or partnerships and shut out the other power. The hard-nosed competition surfaced over the weekend at an Asian economic forum that pitted Vice President Mike Pence against President Xi Jinping of China. The dispute threatens to disrupt the Group of 20 summit meeting that starts Nov. 30 in Argentina. The United States again vented its frustration on Tuesday, accusing China of continuing to engage in unfair trade practices despite Mr. Trump’s tariffs. “China fundamentally has not altered its acts, policies and practices related to technology transfer, intellectual property and innovation, and indeed appears to have taken further unreasonable actions in recent months,” the Office of the United States Trade Representative said in a report . Mr. Trump has repeatedly said China “wants to make a deal very badly,” but continues to warn that he will tax nearly all Chinese imports if Beijing does not open its markets to American companies and end its unfair practices. “China has been ripping off our country for many, many years,” the president told reporters at the White House on Tuesday. “And they don’t rip us off with me.” In Beijing on Wednesday, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Geng Shuang, responded to such criticisms by pointing to a paper previously issued by the government that rebutted similar accusations. “It is quite normal to have economic and trade frictions,” he said at a news conference . “The key is to resolve them through dialogue and consultation on the basis of mutual respect, equality and good faith.” The West was sure the Chinese approach would not work. It just had to wait. It’s still waiting. At the economic forum in Papua New Guinea over the weekend, the United States and China openly clashed over trade in their most explosive diplomatic standoff of the Trump administration. Mr. Pence and Mr. Xi each led delegations that sought to corral the other nations in attendance to side with his country. Elsewhere, the two nations are forging bilateral and multilateral trade pacts in parallel that limit options for the other. During his visit to the Philippines this week, Mr. Xi signed 29 trade and investment deals, though many were broad and vague. Some countries are bristling at the economic demands that the two superpowers have made. Canada’s agriculture minister said Monday that his country could freely enter into formal trade negotiations with China, despite an apparent attempt by the United States to exercise leverage over any such action. On Tuesday, in a blow to China, the European Union announced a proposed law to coordinate scrutiny of foreign investment in strategic sectors, such as ports and technology. Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi are both expected to attend the Group of 20 meeting. While they could come to some mutual understanding, “it is becoming increasingly difficult for both sides to reconcile their competing perspectives,” said Ryan Hass, a China analyst at the Brookings Institution. “Both countries are becoming entrenched in their narratives and having increasing difficulty finding common ground,” Mr. Hass said. But virtually no country in Asia wants to be exclusively aligned with either power, he added. On the issue of recognition of Taiwan, China and the United States are pushing nations and private companies. Since 2016, China has campaigned, often with promises of loans and investments, to persuade a small number of nations to sever diplomatic ties with Taiwan. Three Central American countries did so over the last two years, infuriating top American officials , even though the United States cut formal ties with Taiwan in favor of Communist-ruled China in 1979. American officials are trying to deter nations from taking Chinese loans, often for infrastructure projects, by talking about Beijing’s “debt-trap diplomacy.” In their global propaganda push, they promise that American private investment will flow throughout the world, in part because of a new program to aid businesses with up to $60 billion in loans and loan insurance. Officials in Washington are also trying to rally Southeast Asian nations to stand firm against Beijing over its expansive territorial claims and military buildup in the disputed South China Sea. Mr. Pence criticized China’s moves as “empire and aggression” in a speech at an annual regional forum last week in Singapore. China, for its part, has signaled to other nations that they should push back against Mr. Trump on one of his signature foreign policy actions — withdrawing the United States from the nuclear agreement with Iran. The Obama administration forged the deal to limit Iran’s nuclear program in 2015 with other world powers, including China; backing out of it was one of Mr. Trump’s campaign promises. A top Chinese foreign policy official said in Washington this month that the agreement should “be implemented and observed.” China is continuing to buy oil from Iran , as are some other nations. China’s moves to strengthen its global standing have received a big boost from Mr. Trump’s denunciations of multilateral institutions, alliances and treaties. Mr. Trump pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which shook the confidence of Asian nations. After Mr. Trump announced in June 2017 that the United States would leave the Paris climate accord , China has presented itself as the new standard-bearer on addressing climate change. Earlier that year, in a speech in Davos, Switzerland, Mr. Xi said China would defend the globalized economy in the face of criticism by Mr. Trump. Some Trump administration officials are optimistic that the two leaders will emerge from the Group of 20 meeting with the framework of a trade agreement that would reduce America’s bilateral trade deficit with China and protect the intellectual property of American companies who do business there. Treasury Department officials have been in frequent contact with their Chinese counterparts in hopes of building the groundwork for a deal. However, the latest lurch toward a détente has renewed division among Mr. Trump’s economic team. This month, Peter Navarro, Mr. Trump’s top trade adviser, warned that a weak agreement would have the “stench” of Wall Street . In a public rebuke days later, Larry Kudlow, the National Economic Council director, called Mr. Navarro “way off base.” Mr. Navarro’s comments also frustrated Mr. Trump who, according to a person familiar with his thinking, felt boxed in by the remarks. The dissonance has left China uncertain of the Trump administration’s goals and cast a shadow of uncertainty over their negotiations. “It feels to me like the administration doesn’t quite have one strategy toward China,” said Jon B. Alterman, a global security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “Not only do you see administration leaders saying different things, but it feels like they’re not integrated, especially in the absence of something like the TPP, which was a genuine long-term strategy to deal with China’s rise.” On Monday, the Commerce Department began drawing up new regulations on export controls, outlining potential industries to protect — such as artificial intelligence and quantum robotics — from Chinese theft of intellectual property. In early November, the Justice Department charged a Chinese state-owned company with stealing trade secrets from an American technology company. And last month, the Trump administration outlined a more aggressive system for policing foreign investment, using the expanded powers of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. The Trump administration has also embarked on bilateral trade deals with other countries with the intention of exerting pressure on China. Despite abandoning the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the administration is forging ahead with negotiations with Japan and the Philippines, and officials are eyeing possible talks with Vietnam and India. Criticism of China’s trade practices was at the center of the blowup at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum over the weekend. In several meetings, Wang Yi, the Chinese foreign minister, and his colleagues objected to a draft of the forum’s closing statement that asserted, “We agree to fight protectionism including all unfair trade practices.” Raising his voice, Mr. Wang accused American officials of trying to insert a veiled reference to China, said one American official who was there. At one point, Chinese officials barged into the office of the foreign minister of Papua New Guinea to demand changes. Only China objected to the draft. The forum closed without a consensus statement from the 21 member economies for the first time since 1989. “It was truly a stupid move by the Chinese,” said Bonnie S. Glaser, senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “I guess we should all conclude that China will do whatever it takes to continue to pursue unfair trade practices.” “And they will also continue to put their narrow self-interests first at the expense of multilateral institutions,” she added. “What’s next?” Advertisement"
"Beyond Trump’s Korea Fantasies","Advertisement Supported by Editorial By  The Editorial Board The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section. Well, that was easy. After a single meeting in Singapore, President Trump has, in his own fantastical telling, rendered North Korea “no longer a nuclear threat.” Never mind that North Korea still has as many as 60 nuclear weapons, scores of ballistic missiles and an untold number of facilities that are producing plutonium and enriched uranium. Unfortunately for the president, containing a nuclear power requires more than just one meeting. Negotiating an end to North Korea’s nuclear threat will take deliberation, political courage — and time. The broad outlines of an agreement would be similar to proposals and pacts the United States has developed over the decades to restrain countries with nuclear ambitions: In return for curbing their nuclear programs and allowing international verification, such countries are offered economic, political and security benefits. That was the core of the 1994 Agreed Framework between the United States and North Korea, which fell apart by 2003; a 2006 proposal to Iran by France, Britain, Germany, Russia, China and the United States that went nowhere; and the far more rigorous 2015 Iran deal that involved the same five powers and that Mr. Trump reneged on. With North Korea, there are two unique complications: It already has an arsenal of nuclear weapons and missiles, including an ICBM that can reach the United States, and the locations of many its nuclear sites are unknown, making verification hard if not impossible. And since Mr. Trump has denounced the Iran deal, with its uniquely intrusive inspections and strict requirements for significantly reducing nuclear fuel and other nuclear-related components, as the “worst ever,” he has set quite a high bar for an accord with North Korea. In fact, he says he is insisting on “complete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearization,” presumably meaning eliminating all of North Korea’s atomic weapons and production facilities. That outcome would be an extraordinary achievement. But Mr. Trump has been known to underdeliver on his grander promises, and no nation with a nuclear program this advanced has ever disarmed so completely. So what would a more plausible yet still positive deal look like? SCOPE: In the Iran deal, Tehran agreed to strict controls on its nuclear program in exchange for economic benefits — sanctions relief. Mr. Trump could seek a broader deal with North Korea by offering wider benefits, not just sanctions relief but also security guarantees and full diplomatic relations. This would allow the administration to pursue curbs on North Korea’s missiles, chemical and biological weapons and technology exports, too. The president has said of Kim Jong-un, “I will guarantee his safety.” That is a ridiculous commitment no president could keep, or want to, since it would have the United States protecting one of the world’s worst human rights abusers. Instead, the administration could promise not to try to overthrow Mr. Kim and could reiterate the pledge the United States made in the 1994 Agreed Framework, to work toward peace on the Korean Peninsula. In exchange, North Korea would curb those other weapons and perhaps resolve the fate of South Korean and Japanese citizens North Korea has abducted. A peace treaty to resolve the Korean War 65 years after an armistice was signed could be considered, if it wouldn’t bog down the nuclear negotiations. SHORT-TERM GOALS: Mr. Trump thinks he can snap his fingers and get North Korea to eliminate all its nuclear weapons and facilities. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says to expect “ major disarmament ” by the end of the president’s first term. Some experts have estimated it could take up to 15 years to fully denuclearize. Many say it’s unrealistic to expect it all. No matter how likely or how drawn out such a grand goal would be, some steps can be taken quickly. As a start, the two sides should agree on a framework for sustained, high-level negotiations, including a definition of denuclearization using the 1992 South-North Joint Declaration as a model. In that agreement the two Koreas committed to limiting nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and not to test, manufacture, receive, store, deploy or use nuclear weapons or nuclear reprocessing and uranium enrichment facilities. North Korea should make its temporary freeze on nuclear and missile testing permanent and allow international inspectors to verify the destruction of the test sites the government claims to have blown up. It could even sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Fissile material production should also be frozen. Even if the process ended there, Mr. Trump would achieve something constructive. LONGER TERM: If negotiations are successful, even more so than some think possible, North Korea would eventually begin destroying or removing to another country its fissile material and dismantling weapons and production facilities, providing a comprehensive list of its facilities. Given the nature and breadth of the program, verification by the International Atomic Energy Agency would most likely have to be still more intrusive than the 24/7 system in place in Iran. SANCTIONS RELIEF AND OTHER BENEFITS: The administration insists it won’t lift longstanding sanctions on North Korea until denuclearization is done, but no country will give up such leverage without compensation along the way. If Mr. Trump wants a deal, he’s going to have to work out a plan where sanctions are lifted in stages, commensurate with steps taken by North Korea, and can be reversed if North Korea reneges on its commitments. The president also promised unspecified “security guarantees,” and then went overboard by announcing plans to halt joint military exercises with South Korea (without first consulting Seoul or the Pentagon) and signaling that at some point he may withdraw the 28,000 American troops from South Korea. Such sensitive and far-reaching decisions should be part of a process, not a unilateral concession. Opening an American interests section — a de facto embassy — in Pyongyang and eventually establishing full normal diplomatic relations should also be part of any agreement. CONGRESS’S ROLE: Major national security commitments are stronger and more credible when backed by a bipartisan majority in Congress. If Mr. Trump gets an agreement with North Korea and wants to make sure it survives, he should work with Congress to pass it as a treaty. Advertisement"
"G.O.P. Senators’ Letter to Iran About Nuclear Deal Angers White House","Advertisement Supported by By  Peter Baker WASHINGTON — The fractious debate over a possible nuclear deal with Iran escalated on Monday as 47 Republican senators warned Iran about making an agreement with President Obama, and the White House accused them of undercutting foreign policy. In a rare direct congressional intervention into diplomatic negotiations, the Republicans signed an open letter addressed to “leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran” declaring that any agreement without legislative approval could be reversed by the next president “with the stroke of a pen.” The letter appeared aimed at unraveling a framework agreement even as negotiators grew close to reaching it. Mr. Obama, working with leaders of five other world powers, argues that the pact would be the best way to keep Iran from obtaining a nuclear bomb. But critics from both parties say that such a deal would be a dangerous charade that would leave Iran with the opportunity to eventually build weapons that could be used against Israel or other foes. While the possible agreement has drawn bipartisan criticism, the letter, signed only by Republicans, underscored the increasingly party-line flavor of the clash. Just last week, the Republican House speaker, John A. Boehner, gave Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel the platform of a joint meeting of Congress to denounce the developing deal, and Senate Republicans briefly tried to advance legislation aimed at forcing Mr. Obama to submit it to Congress, alienating Democratic allies. The letter came as Secretary of State John Kerry’s office announced that he would return to Switzerland on Sunday in hopes of completing the framework agreement before an end-of-March deadline. Under the terms being discussed, Iran would pare back its nuclear program enough so that it would be unable to produce enough fuel for a bomb in less than a year if it tried to break out of the agreement. The pact would last at least 10 years; in exchange the world powers would lift sanctions. The letter warned that any nuclear agreement could be reversed by the next president “with the stroke of a pen.” Whether the Republican letter might undercut Iran’s willingness to strike a deal was not clear. Iran reacted with scorn. “In our view, this letter has no legal value and is mostly a propaganda ploy,” Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iran’s foreign minister, said in a statement. “It is very interesting that while negotiations are still in progress and while no agreement has been reached, some political pressure groups are so afraid even of the prospect of an agreement that they resort to unconventional methods, unprecedented in diplomatic history.” A senior American official said the letter probably would not stop an agreement from being reached, but could make it harder to blame Iran if the talks fail. “The problem is if there is not an agreement, the perception of who is at fault is critically important to our ability to maintain pressure, and this type of thing would likely be used by the Iranians in that scenario,” said the official, who spoke anonymously to discuss the negotiations. The White House and congressional Democrats expressed outrage, calling the letter an unprecedented violation of the tradition of leaving politics at the water’s edge. Republicans said that by styling it as an “open letter,” it was akin to a statement, not an overt intervention in the talks. “It’s somewhat ironic to see some members of Congress wanting to make common cause with the hard-liners in Iran,” Mr. Obama told reporters. “It’s an unusual coalition.” Other Democrats were sharper. Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, called it “just the latest in an ongoing strategy, a partisan strategy, to undermine the president’s ability to conduct foreign policy.” Senator Harry M. Reid of Nevada, the Democratic minority leader, said the “Republicans are undermining our commander in chief while empowering the ayatollahs.” The letter, drafted by Senator Tom Cotton, a freshman from Arkansas, and signed by all but seven members of the Senate Republican majority, warned Iran that a deal with Mr. Obama might not stick. “The next president could revoke such an executive agreement with the stroke of a pen, and future Congresses could modify the terms of the agreement at any time,” said the letter, whose existence was reported earlier by Bloomberg News. What the United States and Iran want out of discussions over Iran’s nuclear development. Mr. Cotton said he drafted the letter because Iran’s leaders might not understand America’s constitutional system. He also said the terms of the emerging deal were dangerous because they would not be permanent and would leave Iran with nuclear infrastructure. He noted that four Republican senators who may run for president signed his letter and added that he tried without success to get Democrats to sign. “The only thing unprecedented is an American president negotiating a nuclear deal with the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism without submitting it to Congress,” he said on CNN. The letter revived an old debate about what role Congress should have in diplomacy. Jim Wright, the Democratic House speaker during Ronald Reagan’s presidency, was accused of interfering when he met with opposing leaders in Nicaragua’s contra war. Three House Democrats went to Iraq in 2002 before President George W. Bush’s invasion to try to head off war. And Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, went to Syria in 2007 to meet with President Bashar al-Assad against the wishes of the Bush administration, which was trying to isolate him. An agreement with Iran would not require immediate congressional action because Mr. Obama has the power to lift sanctions he imposed under his executive authority and to suspend others imposed by Congress. But permanently lifting those imposed by Congress, as Iran has sought, would eventually require a vote. Rather than wait, Republicans, joined by several Democrats, drafted legislation aimed at forcing Mr. Obama to submit the agreement to Congress. But when Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican majority leader, moved to advance that legislation for a vote, Democrats who support it balked at taking action before the talks with Iran concluded. Mr. McConnell backed off, but the bill may be revived if a deal is reached. Among the Republicans who declined to sign Mr. Cotton’s letter was Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, the Foreign Relations Committee chairman, who has been working with Democrats on Iran legislation. “We’ve got a bipartisan effort that’s underway that has a chance of being successful, and while I understand all kinds of people want to weigh in,” he said, he concluded that it would not “be helpful in that effort for me to be involved in it.” Some Democrats, like Representative Brad Sherman of California, said the letter and other moves risked making it a party-line issue, in which case it would be impossible to muster a two-thirds vote to override a presidential veto. “The number of Democrats not willing to follow the president’s lead is reduced when it becomes a personal or political issue,” he said. A previous version of this article misstated the given name of the senator who drafted the letter from American lawmakers to Iranian leaders. He is Tom Cotton, not Tim Cotton.

"John Kerry condemns Republicans over open letter to Iran","Several conservative congressmen and media outlets describe letter as ‘not appropriate or productive’ while others question the legality of its contents  Alan Yuhas in Washington  Wed 11 Mar 2015 17.58 GMT   First published on Wed 11 Mar 2015 15.25 GMT   US secretary of state John Kerry angrily condemned and refuted Republicans’ open letter to Iran on Wednesday, expressing shock and rejecting many of its claims, including that a future Republican president would renege on a deal over Tehran’s nuclear program. “This letter ignores more than two centuries of precedent in the conduct of American foreign policy,” Kerry said, adding that the “irresponsible” letter contained “absolutely incorrect” assertions. Kerry said “there’s no grand bargain” and “we’re not negotiating a legally binding plan”, as the letter alleges. He also said that Congress does not have the right to change an executive agreement whenever it sees fit. “It purports to tell the world that if you want to have any confidence in dealing with America then you have to negotiate with 538 members of Congress,” he said, after declaring that Barack Obama’s successor would not rescind a deal. “I’d like to see the next president turn around and just nullify it on behalf of the United States,” Kerry said. “It’s not going to happen.” Republican senators at the hearing responded angrily to Kerry’s remarks, with Bob Corker, who did not sign the letter, repeatedly interrupting the secretary, and at one point entering into the record that Kerry and then-senator Obama had once sponsored a bill asking for congressional oversight of Iran talks. Senator Rand Paul, one of the letter’s signatories and a likely presidential candidate, defended the missive, saying “the letter was to you, the letter was to Iran but it should’ve been CC’d to the White House”. Paul argued that the Obama administration had “trampled the constitution” and needed to listen to congressmen such as himself. White House press secretary Josh Earnest said the letter’s “most profound impact” was to erode the trust of international partners and allies in the United States. Earnest said “generations of credibility” were threatened by the actions of the Republicans , and that “that confidence in the United States of America has been undermined” as allies and other nations weighed whether the US would keep its promises. “It’s not a laughing matter,” Earnest said. Republicans briefly enjoyed a moment of unity by sending the letter, but their coalition cracked as several conservative congressmen and media outlets described the letter as a folly. Corker, one of the few Republicans who did not sign the letter, told the Daily Beast that he “immediately knew that it was not something that, for me, anyway, in my particular role, was going to be constructive”. Republican senator Jeff Flake said the letter was “not appropriate or productive”, and that the matter of Iran’s nuclear capabilities was “too important to divide us among partisan lines”. Hawkish congressman Peter King also called the wisdom of the letter into question. King told reporters on Tuesday he thought the letter set a poor precedent: “I don’t trust the president on this, quite frankly, though I don’t know if I’d go public with it to a foreign government.” Flake’s comments echoed those of Democrats who continued to excoriate Republicans over the letter. Senator Debbie Stabenow took to the chamber floor to quote former senator Arthur Vandenberg, a Republican during the second world war who she said “loathed” president Franklin D Roosevelt. “‘Politics stops at the water’s edge,’” Stabenow quoted Vandenberg. “I can only imagine what senator Vandenberg would say if he were alive today,” she said, about Republicans who had “decided to throw away 70 years of wisdom and stand on the side of the ayatollahs”. Florida Democrat Bill Nelson also urged Republicans to keep perspective: “We can disagree about the specifics but we still have to honor the institution of the presidency, and when it becomes matters of war and peace then we’ve got to unify.” The letter to Iran, designed to undermine nuclear program negotiations between the Obama administration, Tehran and European powers, was signed by 47 of 54 Republican senators. The issue, underscored by a speech to Congress by Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu – at Republicans’ invitation – that railed against the deal, allowed Republicans to briefly unite on a policy point. The party has otherwise been riven by conservative and libertarian factions who disagree about issues such immigration, the economy and foreign intervention. But the condescending tone of the letter, which suggested that Iranians do not understand the American political process, provoked harsh words from both the Obama administration and even Iran’s foreign minister. The minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif called the letter a “propaganda ploy” and derided Republicans for failing to understand international and US law. Harvard law professor Jack Goldsmith notes that Zarif has a valid point : the letter incorrectly states that the Senate has the power to ratify treaties, which it does not – a fact stated even on the Senate’s own website . Obama said that the letter put Republican senators in an “unusual coalition”, saying: “It’s somewhat ironic to see some members of Congress wanting to make common cause with the hardliners in Iran.” US vice-president Joe Biden said the the letter was “beneath the dignity of the institution I revere”. Conservative media sources such as the Wall Street Journal and Fox News, both owned by Rupert Murdoch, also shied away from the letter. The Journal’s editors published an editorial calling the letter a “distraction” . Fox host Megyn Kelly asked Senator Tom Cotton, the letter’s author: “What’s the point in writing to the Iranian mullahs?” “They dismissed it already,” she pressed. “You’ve offended the Obama administration and you may have offended some of the Democrats who would have come over with the Republicans depending on what happens with this deal, to have a stronger say in the Senate.” In Iran, even ayatollah Mahmoud Shahroudi suggested that negotiations deserve a chance to succeed, according to state-owned the Islamic Republic News Agency. Iranian officials “are seeking to advance national interests and we support them”, Shahroudi said in a statement. Shahroudi’s support reiterates Zarif’s position, which finds Republican intransigence “unfortunate” but is still “certain that there are measures to achieve such a deal”. Cotton and other hawkish Republican senators have defended the letter , saying that their intention is primarily to prevent Iran from attaining the ability to create a nuclear weapon. “I didn’t think it was going to further our efforts to get to a place where Congress would play the appropriate role that it should on Iran,” he said."
"Does Hitachi decision mean the end of UK's nuclear ambitions?","Despite recent scrapping of three plants, experts still feel the energy has stake in future  Thu 17 Jan 2019 11.23 GMT   First published on Thu 17 Jan 2019 11.12 GMT   Ever since Tony Blair rebooted support for nuclear power 13 years ago , British governments have been committed to a new generation of reactors to secure supplies and cut carbon emissions. However, those ambitions have yielded only one project under construction, Hinkley Point C in Somerset, south-west England. The past two months have dealt serious blows to hopes for more, with Toshiba abandoning its plans for Moorside in Cumbria and Hitachi scrapping its Wylfa plant on Anglesey. Wylfa’s death means a second Hitachi plant planned for Oldbury, Gloucestershire, is doomed, too. Together the three projects would have provided 15% of today’s electricity demand. That begs the question: is it time to rethink plans for new nuclear or redouble our nuclear efforts? With the cost of wind, solar and batteries dropping rapidly, have renewables and smart technologies matured enough to fill the gap? What is not in question is the UK’s need for more low-carbon power. Coal and old nuclear plants are shutting in the 2020s and tough climate targets are looming . The Green party and groups such as Greenpeace advocate ditching nuclear in favour of more renewables, energy efficiency and flexibility through imports, batteries and other technologies. However, most energy industry experts think the future involves some new nuclear. The government has already restated its commitment to new nuclear power. “It’s difficult to see a low-carbon energy system in the future which has no new nuclear,” says George Day, the head of policy and regulation at the government-funded Energy Systems Catapult. “If you try to rely on just renewables and storage, without carbon capture and storage or nuclear, you are looking at a very challenging transition and one that is more costly than a balanced mix [of supplies].” All of National Grid’s four future energy scenarios envisage some new nuclear, although the amounts differ considerably. Peter Atherton, an analyst at Cornwall Insight, said it was hard to imagine an energy system without the baseload power – or continuous electricity supply – provided by nuclear. “There is a school of thought that says baseload is a 20th century thing. They might be right – but it would be a big call by government to bet baseload won’t be a thing by 2025.” The government has already downgraded the amount of new nuclear it expects to be built in the future. It assumes 13 gigawatts of new nuclear capacity by 2035, implying three further nuclear power stations in addition to the 3.2GW plant at Hinkley. There are now only two firms in the running, which are both involved in plans for two new plants. French state-owned EDF Energy, which is behind Hinkley, wants to start building a carbon copy of that project at Sizewell, on the Suffolk coast, in 2021. Chinese state-owned CGN, meanwhile, is accelerating work on a Chinese-designed reactor for Bradwell in Essex, with the aim of being operational around 2030. Hitachi’s withdrawal suggests the financing model used for Hinkley, and proposed for Wylfa, is dead. The government will likely junk that approach – of offering a guaranteed price of power for 35 years – for an alternative known as the “regulated asset base” (RAB) model. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy has created a whole division to develop RAB, where a regulator would set a fixed sum for the power station’s costs and fixed returns for the developer, paid for by energy billpayers or taxpayers. Officials are assessing RAB’s viability, with a decision expected this year. But critics say the approach loads the risk of nuclear plant construction delays, such as those seen in France and Finland , on citizens. Returns would also be paid for years before any electricity was generated. EDF Energy backs the RAB model and the Chinese have said they would look at it. The influential government adviser Dieter Helm, professor of energy policy at Oxford University, has called it “plausible and preferable” to the Hinkley approach if the UK wants new nuclear. Day believes it could produce the power stations that ministers want. Labour, which is pro-nuclear, has branded the approach risky and reckless but has not put forward an alternative. Given the uncertainty over new nuclear, could the UK manage without it? Maybe. The obvious route is a lot more renewable power capacity than currently planned. The government’s climate change advisers last year hiked up the amount of renewables they expected four years ago, to 45-60% of electricity supplies by 2030, up from 40-55% previously. Both are a big increase from the 33% level today . The Committee on Climate Change said there is evidence the energy system could cope with as much as 60% of supplies coming from intermittent renewables. Filling the 9.2GW-sized hole left by Moorside, Wylfa and Oldbury would require 14GW of offshore wind power, according to the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit thinktank. That is equivalent to more than 20 of the world’s biggest offshore windfarm , which consists of 87 turbines. According to Atherton, the only way renewables and storage could plausibly fill the nuclear gap would be to “spend a vast amount of money on saturating the UK with offshore wind”. That could end up with enough turbines in enough different locations to replicate the “always-on” nature of nuclear. Large-scale batteries will help with the variable nature of renewables and are expanding fast . But they will not address the fact that electricity demand is much higher in winter than summer, or solve long windless spells. The other big techno fix in the arsenal of low-carbon energy options is carbon capture and storage (CCS). However, many years of government efforts to kickstart it failed and ministers have switched their focus away from CCS for power stations to CCS for industrial uses . Day said gas power stations with CCS still looked “pretty promising” but significant policy changes would be needed to enable firms to invest in it. Others, however, are more dismissive. Atherton said: “People have been working on CCS gas for 20 years and nobody has got within a mile of it yet. People will tell you the technology works … that doesn’t mean I can do it on a budget.”"
"29 U.S. Scientists Praise Iran Nuclear Deal in Letter to Obama","Advertisement Supported by By  William J. Broad Twenty-nine of the nation’s top scientists — including Nobel laureates, veteran makers of nuclear arms and former White House science advisers — wrote to President Obama on Saturday to praise the Iran deal, calling it innovative and stringent. The letter, from some of the world’s most knowledgeable experts in the fields of nuclear weapons and arms control, arrives as Mr. Obama is lobbying Congress, the American public and the nation’s allies to support the agreement . The two-page letter may give the White House arguments a boost after the blow Mr. Obama suffered on Thursday when Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, a Democrat and among the most influential Jewish voices in Congress, announced he would oppose the deal , which calls for Iran to curb its nuclear program and allow inspections in return for an end to international oil and financial sanctions. The first signature on the letter is from Richard L. Garwin, a physicist who helped design the world’s first hydrogen bomb and has long advised Washington on nuclear weapons and arms control. He is among the last living physicists who helped usher in the nuclear age. Also signing is Siegfried S. Hecker, a Stanford professor who, from 1986 to 1997, directed the Los Alamos weapons laboratory in New Mexico, the birthplace of the bomb. The facility produced designs for most of the arms now in the nation’s nuclear arsenal. Other prominent signatories include Freeman Dyson of Princeton, Sidney Drell of Stanford and Rush D. Holt, a physicist and former member of Congress who now leads the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the world’s largest general scientific society. Twenty-nine of the nation’s top scientists wrote to President Obama on Saturday in support of the deal, which calls for Iran to curb its nuclear program and allow inspections in return for an end to sanctions. Most of the 29 who signed the letter are physicists, and many of them have held what the government calls Q clearances — granting access to a special category of secret information that bears on the design of nuclear arms and is considered equivalent to the military’s top secret security clearance. Many of them have advised Congress, the White House or federal agencies over the decades. For instance, Frank von Hippel, a Princeton physicist, served as assistant director for national security in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy during the Clinton administration. The six Nobel laureates who signed are Philip W. Anderson of Princeton University; Leon N. Cooper of Brown University; Sheldon L. Glashow of Boston University; David Gross of the University of California, Santa Barbara; Burton Richter of Stanford University; and Frank Wilczek of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. A guide to help you navigate the deal between global powers and Tehran. The letter uses the words “innovative” and “stringent” more than a half-dozen times, saying, for instance, that the Iran accord has “more stringent constraints than any previously negotiated nonproliferation framework.” “We congratulate you and your team,” the letter says in its opening to Mr. Obama, adding that the Iran deal “will advance the cause of peace and security in the Middle East and can serve as a guidepost for future nonproliferation agreements.” In a technical judgment that seemed more ominous than some other assessments of Tehran’s nuclear capability, the letter says that Iran, before curbing its nuclear program during the long negotiations, was “only a few weeks” away from having fuel for nuclear weapons. Here is a look at what Iran and the United States wanted, and what they got. Dr. Garwin and Dr. Holt were the main organizers behind the group that wrote and signed the letter, according to two of the letter’s signatories. The letter comes amid a flurry of organized efforts by supporters and opponents of the agreement to shape the public debate ahead of congressional action on the deal. The body of the letter praises the technical features of the Iran accord and offers tacit rebuttals to recent criticisms on such issues as verification and provisions for investigating what specialists see as evidence of Iran’s past research on nuclear arms. It also focuses on whether Iran could use the accord as diplomatic cover to pursue nuclear weapons in secret. The deal’s plan for resolving disputes, the letter says, greatly mitigates “concerns about clandestine activities.” It hails the 24-day cap on Iranian delays to site investigations as “unprecedented,” adding that the agreement “will allow effective challenge inspection for the suspected activities of greatest concern.” It also welcomes as without precedent the deal’s explicit banning of research on nuclear weapons “rather than only their manufacture,” as established in the 1968 Non-Proliferation Treaty, the top arms-control agreement of the nuclear age. The letter notes criticism that the Iran accord, after 10 years, will let Tehran potentially develop nuclear arms without constraint. “In contrast,” it says, “we find that the deal includes important long-term verification procedures that last until 2040, and others that last indefinitely.” An article on Sunday about a letter of support for President Obama’s proposed Iran nuclear deal written by experts in nuclear weapons and arms control omitted a Nobel laureate from a listing of those who signed the letter. He is Philip W. Anderson of Princeton University. Advertisement"

"U.S. and North Korean Officials Race to Resurrect Trump-Kim Meeting","Advertisement Supported by By  Michael D. Shear and David E. Sanger WASHINGTON — The United States and North Korea on Sunday kicked off an urgent, behind-the-scenes effort to resurrect a summit meeting between their two leaders by June 12, racing to develop a joint agenda and dispel deep skepticism about the chances for reaching a framework for a lasting nuclear agreement in so little time. Technical and diplomatic experts from the United States made a rare visit to North Korea to meet with their counterparts, American officials said on Sunday. Before any summit meeting, the American team, led by Sung Kim, a veteran diplomat, is seeking detailed commitments from Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, about his regime’s willingness to abandon its nuclear weapons program. In a tweet Sunday night, President Trump confirmed the meetings in the North Korean part of Panmunjom, a “truce village” in  the Demilitarized Zone that separates the two Koreas. He also expressed his administration’s newfound optimism about the meeting, further embracing the conciliatory language both sides have used since he canceled the planned meeting in a bitterly worded letter to Mr. Kim on Thursday. “I truly believe North Korea has brilliant potential and will be a great economic and financial Nation one day,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter after a second straight day of golf at his Virginia club. “Kim Jong Un agrees with me on this. It will happen!” White House officials said Joe Hagin, a deputy White House chief of staff, is leading a separate delegation in Singapore, where the summit meeting had been scheduled to take place, to work out logistics: when the various meetings would take place, how much would be open to the press, which officials would be in the negotiating rooms, how to handle security concerns. The simultaneous negotiations in the DMZ and in Singapore signaled an accelerated effort by the governments in both countries to complete the substantive and practical preparations required to get the meeting back on track. Such issues would typically be handled by a well-established diplomatic process of lower-level negotiations that usually takes months, if not years, before a meeting between the leaders of two nations. But Mr. Trump short-circuited that process in March, when he abruptly accepted an invitation to meet with Mr. Kim. Now, after just as abruptly canceling the summit meeting, Mr. Trump has — wittingly or not — set in motion a more normal set of discussions to lay the groundwork for an agreement about North Korea’s nuclear weapons program ahead of a decision on whether to hold a meeting between the two leaders after all. The timeline is still extraordinarily condensed. Mr. Trump’s repeatedly stated desire to keep June 12 as a possible date for a summit meeting means that officials on both sides are rushing to see if the necessary preparations can be completed in a matter of days. Veteran negotiators said it remained unclear whether the two sides could complete enough work to make a meeting possible. “The president says he’s not going to go until there is substantial agreement. The question is, Is there time to reach that kind of agreement?” said Joseph Y. Yun, a former chief North Korea negotiator at the State Department, who retired in part because of his frustration with his agency’s diminished role. “Right now, the summit is kind of teetering on whether we make progress on those things.” Two top Republican lawmakers expressed deep misgivings on Sunday about the prospects for a successful summit meeting in just over two weeks, and warned that Mr. Kim would never agree to give up the nuclear weapons his country has spent decades developing. “I remain convinced that he does not want to denuclearize, in fact he will not denuclearize,” Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, said on ABC’s “This Week.” He dismissed demonstrations of good will by Mr. Kim — including the release of American prisoners and the destruction of a nuclear test site — as meaningless. “It’s all a show,” Mr. Rubio said. “It’s a show.” Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, echoed Mr. Rubio’s concerns. He said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that a freeze of the country’s weapons program would be progress, but added that “a lot of us have been skeptical that North Korea will ever agree to total denuclearization.” Veterans of past negotiations with North Korea also expressed concern on Sunday about the possibility that Mr. Kim could demand that in exchange for denuclearization, the United States must withdraw its “nuclear umbrella” that protects South Korea from adversaries. James R. Clapper Jr., the former director of national intelligence under President Barack Obama, who spent part of his early intelligence career in South Korea, said on CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday that such a demand could mean the United States would have to agree not to fly its nuclear-capable bombers “in the Korean Peninsula or in operational proximity.” It is unclear if Mr. Trump would ever agree to significant restrictions on the American nuclear arsenal. American officials have said the discussions are progressing well, offering the same kind of optimistic assessment that Mr. Trump has delivered over the past 48 hours. In brief remarks to reporters on Saturday night, the president said the lower-level negotiations are “going along very well,” though he added his usual caveat: “We’ll see what happens.” On the Korean Peninsula, a surprise meeting between Mr. Kim and President Moon Jae-in of South Korea also produced some progress toward a meeting. Mr. Moon said Mr. Kim wanted to discuss “ complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula ” with Mr. Trump. “What is not so clear to him is how firmly he can trust the United States’ commitment to ending hostile relations and providing security guarantees for his government, should it denuclearize,” Mr. Moon said on Sunday at a news conference in Seoul, the South Korean capital, the day after the meeting on the North Korean side of Panmunjom. The answer to that question may hinge on the lower-level discussions going on between representatives of the two countries, a fraught process that can sometimes dissolve into disagreement and at other times produce halting progress toward a meeting. Administration officials say they are under no illusions that the team now in North Korea can negotiate the details to begin to dismantle the sprawling nuclear, missile and biological weapons programs in North Korea — all of which were part of the objective Secretary of State Mike Pompeo laid out recently for the talks. In the case of the Iran deal, a detailed plan struck in 2015 that Mr. Trump abandoned this month as insufficient, the negotiations took more than two years. But they can negotiate language and a timetable that Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump can agree on, a framework for further negotiations. That alone would be a major accomplishment, as North Korea has rejected the idea of rapid denuclearization, and wants a step-by-step approach. The United States would also have to agree to changes it would make, perhaps opening talks on a peace treaty that would formally end the Korean War. Another possible concession would be to provide security guarantees to the North that go beyond previous presidents’ pledges that the United States would not seek to overthrow the current government. But for now, veteran diplomats said the negotiating teams from the United States have the kind of experience needed to at least work out the details needed for a summit meeting. The meetings in North Korea on Sunday, which were first reported by The Washington Post , reflected Mr. Trump’s willingness to turn to diplomats and functionaries with decades of experience and deep ties to former President George W. Bush. Mr. Hagin was a close Bush confidant and fixer in the White House, and Mr. Kim, the diplomat leading the American team, was tapped by Mr. Bush for a role similar to his new one. A former United States ambassador to South Korea, Mr. Kim is no stranger to the details of North Korea’s nuclear program — or the country’s deceptions. A decade ago this month, he and a small team of State Department officials were in Pyongyang to collect the operating records of a nuclear reactor at Yongbyon. He came across the DMZ with thousands of pages, which American experts at the C.I.A. and the Energy Department used to calculate how much plutonium the country could have produced. Ultimately, North Korea blew up the cooling tower of that reactor, much as it blew up tunnel entrances to its nuclear test site last week. But within a few years, the reactor was back up and running. And now Mr. Kim faces a far more complex program — one that has produced more than 20 nuclear weapons, that now has uranium enrichment capabilities as well as the plutonium program, and missiles the C.I.A. estimates will soon be able to reach most American cities. News of any progress his team is making will likely be sporadic, given the lack of secure communications from inside North Korea, officials said. Mr. Yun said the goal for Mr. Kim was likely to be developing a set of documents, agreed on by both sides, that detail the three steps that North Korea is willing to consider taking toward elimination of its nuclear weapons program. The first step, he said, is a declaration of how far the North Koreans are willing to go in unwinding their weapons program. The second is deciding how and when the North Koreans would provide an accounting of that process to the United States. And the third is determining how the United States would verify those claims. “It’s a good group,” Mr. Yun said. “It’s a technical group. It’s an expert group, and they know the issues. They know what needs to be done.” Advertisement"
"North Korea Criticizes ‘Gangster-Like’ U.S. Attitude After Talks With Mike Pompeo","Advertisement Supported by By  Gardiner Harris and Choe Sang-Hun PYONGYANG, North Korea — North Korea accused the Trump administration on Saturday of pushing a “unilateral and gangster-like demand for denuclearization” and called it “deeply regrettable,” hours after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said his two days of talks in the North Korean capital were “productive.” Despite the criticism, North Korea’s Foreign Ministry said the country’s leader, Kim Jong-un, still wanted to build on the “friendly relationship and trust” forged with President Trump during their summit meeting in Singapore on June 12. The ministry said Mr. Kim had written a personal letter to Mr. Trump, reiterating that trust. The harsh North Korean reaction may have been a time-tested negotiating tactic. Two months ago, a brief blowup between the two countries led President Trump to briefly cancel, then reschedule, his summit meeting with Mr. Kim. But North Korea’s remarks also played to a larger fear: that the summit meeting’s vaguely worded commitment to “the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” meant something very different in Pyongyang and Washington. Distrust on both sides has led the Americans to insist on rapid, deep dismantlement and highly intrusive verification; the North Koreans want an early lifting of sanctions and a formal end to the Korean War, among other steps. On Saturday, Mr. Pompeo and his entourage offered no immediate evidence that they had come away with anything tangible to show that North Korea was willing to surrender its nuclear and missile weapons programs. Mr. Pompeo did not meet with Mr. Kim, as he had in past visits, but held talks with Kim Yong-chol, a senior official who has been the country’s point person in deliberations with the United States, South Korea and China. “These are complicated issues, but we made progress on almost all of the central issues,” Mr. Pompeo said before boarding a plane for Tokyo. He called the meetings “productive.” Administration officials said Saturday that they were neither surprised nor concerned about the North Korean response, and they pointed out that its final lines, the ones attributed directly to Mr. Kim, were conciliatory and referred to a feeling of trust toward Mr. Trump. The North Korean Foreign Ministry’s assessment was decidedly downbeat. “The attitude and demands from the U.S. side during the high-level talks were nothing short of deeply regrettable,” the ministry said, accusing American “working-level” officials of trying to destroy the agreement struck in Singapore. Mr. Pompeo came to Pyongyang to try to get the North Koreans to match their vague commitment to denuclearization — signed by Kim Jong-un in the June meeting with President Trump — with some kind of action. Among the first priorities were a declaration of weapons sites, a timeline of deconstruction efforts and, perhaps, a written statement that the North’s definition of denuclearization matched Mr. Pompeo’s. Asked if he had gotten any of those, Mr. Pompeo declined to divulge details. Washington insists that North Korea disclose all the details of its nuclear weapons program, dismantle its facilities and let outside inspectors verify the steps. The idea is to remove all the North’s nuclear weapons and its ability to build more, before offering any significant rewards. The North has long rejected such an approach, instead demanding that the United States take reciprocal measures in each “phased” step it takes toward denuclearization. On Saturday, the North Korean statement reiterated that “phased, simultaneous actions” were “the quickest way of realizing the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.” During their meetings with Mr. Pompeo, North Korean officials proposed dismantling a missile engine-test site and opening negotiations for repatriating the remains of American service members killed in the Korean War, the Foreign Ministry said. In return, they proposed that the United States take “simultaneous” actions of expanding bilateral exchanges and announcing an end to the Korean War in July. But the ministry said that the United States balked at declaring an end to the war, which North Korea said was a crucial first step toward building trust. “The issues the U.S. side insisted on during the talks were the same cancerous ones that the past U.S. administrations had insisted on,” the ministry said. It said North Korea had so far taken the “irreversible” action of destroying its underground nuclear test site, while the United States had taken only the “reversible” action of suspending joint military exercises with South Korea. Privately, Mr. Pompeo has said that he doubts the North Korean leader will ever give up his nuclear weapons. And those doubts have been reinforced in recent days by intelligence showing that North Korea, far from dismantling its weapons facilities, has been expanding them and taking steps to conceal the efforts from the United States. Mr. Trump has said his summit meeting with Mr. Kim was a success, and he has declared the North “no longer a nuclear threat.” Squaring Mr. Trump’s evaluation with what increasingly seems like a more troubling reality has become one of Mr. Pompeo’s greatest challenges as the United States’ chief diplomat. Mr. Pompeo started his day by leaving the elaborate guesthouse where he was staying to make a secure phone call to Mr. Trump. Also on the call were John R. Bolton, Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, and John Kelly, the White House chief of staff. State Department officials have assumed that listening devices are planted throughout the guesthouse. This was Mr. Pompeo’s third trip to Pyongyang, but the first time he had spent the night. Even so, it appeared to have been his least productive visit. There had been hopes that Mr. Pompeo would get the North to agree to hand over the remains of American war dead. But Mr. Pompeo said that another meeting had been set for July 12 for further talks on repatriating the remains, a dialogue that will be led by the Defense Department. Mr. Pompeo and Kim Yong-chol began their meetings on Saturday in Pyongyang with the customary flowery greetings. But just before reporters were ushered out of the room, the exchange grew sharper. “There are things that I have to clarify,” Mr. Kim said. “There are things that I have to clarify as well,” Mr. Pompeo quickly responded. At the airport in Pyongyang, when asked if he had brought up the satellite images that appeared to show that the North was actually expanding its capabilities, Mr. Pompeo responded: “We talked about what the North Koreans are continuing to do.” He said they had discussed “achieving what Chairman Kim and President Trump both agreed to, which is the complete denuclearization of North Korea. No one walked away from that, they’re still equally committed, Chairman Kim is still committed.” Blistering rhetoric is certainly not unusual from Pyongyang, but the North’s statement points to the risks of Mr. Trump’s decision to bypass the usual process of extensive low-level talks to build a framework for an agreement that leaders can push across the finish line. Convinced of his own negotiating abilities, Mr. Trump decided to meet with Mr. Kim directly in Singapore in hopes a face-to-face encounter would cut through decades of hostility and bypass months or even years of back-and-forth. But national leaders do not negotiate or verify arms control agreements; governments do. Dozens of experts are needed to write the hundreds of pages needed to describe North Korea’s nuclear and missile infrastructure and then delineate how it will be curtailed, dismantled and inspected. Critics say the administration’s approach — and Mr. Trump’s declarations of success — have ended up easing much of the economic and diplomatic pressure on Pyongyang. “Negotiating with North Korea is always difficult, but President Trump made it immeasurably harder with his euphoric tweets about how the North is no longer a nuclear threat,” said Wendy Sherman, a top Obama administration diplomat who helped negotiate the Iran nuclear deal and has negotiated with the North Koreans as well. Ms. Sherman added: “With North Korea, there is no full knowledge of what they have, where it is and no ability to verify denuclearization. Long way to go.” A small group of reporters traveling with Mr. Pompeo were allowed into the Pyongyang meetings to record their initial moments, as is routine for such diplomatic encounters. But the North Koreans allowed reporters to stay several minutes longer than usual. On Saturday morning, those extra moments led to the recording of an unusually lengthy exchange between Mr. Pompeo and Kim Yong-chol. “This isn’t your first visit to our country, yet this is your first night in our country,” Mr. Kim began. “Did you sleep well last night?” “I did, I did, thank you for the accommodation,” Mr. Pompeo answered. A few moments later, Mr. Kim said, “But we did have very serious discussions on very important matters yesterday. So thinking about those discussions, you might have not slept well last night.” “Director Kim, I slept just fine,” Mr. Pompeo responded, an edge creeping into his voice. “We did have a good set of conversations yesterday. I appreciate that, and I look forward to our continued conversations today as well.” Heather Nauert, the State Department spokeswoman, said Mr. Pompeo did not see the process as doomed. “There’s a lot of hard work that’s left to be done,” she said. “We never thought this would be easy, and that’s why consultations continue.” Gardiner Harris reported from Pyongyang, North Korea, and Choe Sang-Hun from Seoul, South Korea.

"Europe Holds Summit With China, More Skeptically This Time","Advertisement Supported by By  Steven Erlanger BRUSSELS — The European Union, which does more than 1.5 billion euros a day in two-way trade with China, came late to the industrial, political and security threats China poses. For a long time, Europe saw China as another Japan, only with some human-rights issues. But with the outspoken ambitions of the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, and continuing battles over technology transfer, closed markets and industrial espionage, that is changing. On Tuesday, the European Union and China met in Brussels for their 21st annual summit. The challenge for Europe is to forge a united front in the face of a China that only last month it labeled an “economic competitor” in critical industrial fields and a “systemic rival” politically. The mood is certainly tougher now, especially after Italy last month became the first Group of 7 country to join China’s vast Belt and Road project, which the French analyst François Heisbourg described as “China’s own concept on how to organize the global space.” In difficult negotiations, the Europeans had a hard time finding agreement on a joint statement with the Chinese that is serious about substance. They succeeded up to a point, but the commitments made by China are more about further talks than specific actions. Donald Tusk, the European Council president, pointed to China’s agreement to discuss reform of the World Trade Organization’s rules on industrial subsidies, which he termed a “breakthrough.” But Jean-Claude Juncker, who leads the bloc’s bureaucracy as president of the European Commission, said tartly that “progress is slower than we like.’’ The Europeans did succeed, by threatening not to sign a joint statement, in getting a promise to conclude a long-discussed bilateral investment deal by the end of 2020, which would improve market access, and a promise to limit forced technology transfers. But a senior European official also pointed to a statement finally reached after the last summit, in Beijing in July, which was full of promises not delivered, especially on issues like investment ground rules and market reciprocity, which are sources of tension now. If anything, there has been backsliding and more vivid violations of human rights, like the detention of foreigners and the settlement camps for Uighurs. Prime Minister Li Keqiang of China, who led the delegation to Brussels, defended China’s practices while insisting that Beijing “follows W.T.O. rules.’’ He said China was “ready to work with the E.U. and others for consensus and have discussions on reform,’’ emphasizing that the two sides “have common interests on many issues.’’ If China is now a “systemic rival,” the joint statement did not reflect that new view, but tried to preserve a sense of partnership, said Theresa Fallon, director of the Centre for Russia Europe Asia Studies in Brussels. The joint statement, she said, “also highlights the E.U.’s preferred approach of dialogue and cooperation with China and is a contrast to President Trump’s more assertive approach.” Last month, President Emmanuel Macron of France said that the European Union had finally woken up to China. “China plays on our divisions,” he said. “The period of European naïveté is over.” But the bloc was slow to respond to Belt and Road, just as it was slow to react to China’s effort in 2012 to sow divisions on the Continent with its “16 plus 1” initiative — itself and 16 Central and Eastern European nations. They are to hold their own meeting starting Thursday in Croatia, and Mr. Li will go there as well. At the end of the month, many European Union member states will also go to Beijing for a Belt and Road forum. The 16 plus 1 group contains 11 European Union member states, five of which use the euro, and four of which are formal candidates for membership in the bloc. And Greece is reported to be looking to join. All have been eager for Chinese investment, which carries fewer demands, if higher risks, than Western banks or development funds. And already countries with significant financial ties to China, like Greece and Italy , have blocked European consensus on resolutions condemning Chinese behavior. “China will attempt to use every opportunity, including the E.U.-China Summit, and the 16 plus 1 meeting in Croatia, to pit Europeans against each other and against the United States,’’ said Jamie Fly, the director of the Asia and Future of Geopolitics Programs for the German Marshall Fund in Washington. ‘‘It would be foolish and shortsighted to take the bait,” he added. Avoiding that may not be easy. President Trump sees the European Union as an economic “foe.” On Tuesday, Mr. Trump threatened an additional $11 billion in tariffs in response to European subsidies to Airbus. “The EU has taken advantage of the U.S. on trade for many years. It will soon stop!’’ Mr. Trump tweeted. China, on the other hand, works hard, despite recent conflicts, to be attractive to European businesses, both for investment and trade. “China uses honey while the U.S. is using vinegar,” said Mr. Heisbourg, the French analyst. “The U.S. is pushing Europe in China’s direction.” China also emphasizes its agreement with Europe on issues Mr. Trump has opposed. Those include climate change, as well as commitment to the Iran nuclear deal, which Mr. Trump has abandoned. The relationship is crucial for both Brussels and Beijing, and the honey is difficult to resist. The European Union is China’s biggest trading partner, and China is the bloc’s second-biggest after the United States. Ivan Hodac, the former head of the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association, which has major interests in China, says the new European wariness is coming late. “The E.U. is divided,” Mr. Hodac said. “Each country has its own financial interest. So long as there is no free trade agreement or investment deal with China,” he said, Europe is vulnerable. “And the Americans need to understand we are really in it together.” Washington and Brussels share similar goals with China. But Mr. Trump has favored trying to reach his own deals with China while also, the Europeans argue, undermining the W.T.O., whose rules China has at least promised to obey. There are also new security concerns, with the United States warning allies away from Huawei, the large Chinese telecommunications company, as the world moves to 5G wireless networks. With defense and industry increasingly dependent on 5G and artificial intelligence, areas where China is innovating and investing heavily, Washington and other allies, like Germany and France, see dangers. Yet Huawei is cheaper than its competitors, attractive to smaller countries and central European ones, and there is no large American alternative. Nor is there a European Union version of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius, an interagency group that carefully screens Chinese and other foreign investments to protect national security. There is a new investment screening mechanism by Brussels, but it has no enforcement framework. In a column for the German economic newspaper Handelsblatt, Mr. Li denied accusations that Beijing was trying to split the bloc. “We emphatically support the European integration process in the hope of a united and prosperous Europe,” he wrote. These are welcome words for the Europeans. But they are more skeptical now that such promises will be met. Advertisement"
"Obama Pledges More Military Aid to Reassure Persian Gulf Allies on Iran Deal","Advertisement Supported by By  Julie Hirschfeld Davis and David E. Sanger CAMP DAVID, Md. — President Obama on Thursday offered Saudi Arabia and smaller Arab states new support to defend against potential missile strikes, maritime threats and cyberattacks from Iran, calling his commitment to their security “ironclad” in an effort to allay fears that a nuclear accord will empower Tehran, their main rival in the Middle East. But in a daylong meeting here, Mr. Obama stopped short of offering a formal defense pact that would obligate the United States to come to the nations’ aid if they were attacked. Instead, he tried to reassure them that he was serious about bolstering their security and willing to help them counter Iran. “I am reaffirming our ironclad commitment to the security of our gulf partners,” Mr. Obama said at a news conference at the wooded presidential retreat here after seeing off the leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council, who had attended a day of private meetings here. But he went on to issue a carefully worded pledge that was far less robust than the mutual defense treaty that the gulf nations had sought . He said aggression against their countries would bring a readiness “to work with our G.C.C. partners to urgently determine what actions may be appropriate,” including the potential use of force. Mr. Obama also sought to assuage the fears of Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations in the group that say that lifting oil and financial sanctions on Iran, as called for in the framework of a nuclear deal, would allow Iran to expand its influence from Iraq to Syria to Yemen. The president played down the threat, saying that no sanctions would be lifted unless Tehran complied with the stringent terms of the deal, that sanctions had already devastated Iran’s economy and that, in any case, “most of the destabilizing activity that Iran engages in is low-tech, low-cost activity.” “It’s not to deny the concerns that were there about what happens when sanctions are reduced,” Mr. Obama said after the meeting with top officials from Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. “But it was to emphasize that what matters more is the things that we can do now to ensure that some of this destabilizing activity is no longer taking place.” In a series of working sessions and a lunch on Thursday, Mr. Obama and members of his cabinet — including Secretary of State John Kerry and Energy Secretary Ernest J. Moniz, the lead negotiators with Iran — gave the leaders and representatives of the gulf council a detailed briefing about the status of the nuclear negotiations. The administration argued that the deal, if completed by the June 30 deadline, would ultimately make the gulf countries and the region safer by preventing Iran from creating a nuclear weapon in the next 10 to 15 years. After that, many of the restrictions on Iran would be lifted, one of the main reasons that Arab leaders have objected to the deal. Mr. Obama also outlined what a senior official called an “extensive program” of military cooperation between the United States and gulf nations, including assistance with a regional program to defend against Iranian missiles, increased collaboration on maritime security and more joint training exercises. Most of the new commitments involve helping the gulf nations develop their own defenses, rather than furnishing American weapons or other military resources. Mr. Obama said the United States would help create an early-warning capability for a regional missile defense system that the nations said they would develop. But in the joint statement agreed upon by Mr. Obama and the gulf officials on Thursday, there was no mention of another potential risk raised by the negotiations with Iran: the possibility that a completed agreement could prompt Saudi Arabia or other nations in the region to enhance their own nuclear capabilities. The Saudis have said they will match whatever nuclear enrichment capability Iran is allowed to keep under the agreement. That has raised fears of an “enrichment race” that could ultimately lead to an arms race. American and Iranian officials are using different words to describe elements of the preliminary agreement to limit Iran’s nuclear program. With the type of agreement being sought by Mr. Obama and international allies, “there will be no need to see the type of regional arms race that would make an already volatile part of the world that much more unstable and insecure,” Benjamin J. Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser, told reporters. Mr. Obama was walking a fine line in pledging help to the Arab states. He knew he could not guarantee their security, as the United States does for Japan and South Korea; nor could he pledge to come to their aid if called, as America does for members of NATO. Yet providing more military goods and some training seems to merely extend existing arrangements. When President George W. Bush faced this problem more than a decade ago with Pakistan, he invited the country’s president at the time, Pervez Musharraf, to Camp David and designated the country a “major non-NATO ally,” a status created by Congress in 1989. (In the Middle East, Bahrain, Egypt, Israel, Jordan and Kuwait are “major non-NATO allies.”) But administration officials said that would probably not work in the case of many of the Arab states, whose human rights records are often questionable and whose capabilities vary greatly. Nor was Mr. Obama prepared to say that the region is covered by the American nuclear “umbrella,” a concept from the Cold War. The roster of officials present reflected the dampened expectations for the gathering, to which only two of the six gulf nations sent their top leaders. The absence of King Salman of Saudi Arabia attracted particular attention because the leaders of his majority-Sunni country are increasingly uneasy about the prospect of a nuclear deal with Shiite-led Iran, which they fear would free Tehran to further exert its influence in the region. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, the Saudi interior minister, and Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the defense minister, who met with Mr. Obama in the Oval Office on Wednesday, attended the meeting instead. Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir of Saudi Arabia said after the day’s final session that his country would welcome a deal that deprived Iran of nuclear weapons capability, but that it was not clear yet whether the final agreement would achieve that. “We will follow the talks and see before we can judge in terms of whether or not the Iranians will do what it takes to reach a deal,” Mr. Jubeir said.

"Barack Obama wins support from Gulf leaders for nuclear deal with Iran","Qatar welcomes ‘key factor for stability in region’ and Saudis voice growing acceptance of deal at end of Camp David summit  Dan Roberts at Camp David  Fri 15 May 2015 01.37 BST   Last modified on Fri 14 Jul 2017 22.08 BST   Barack Obama has secured support from Gulf leaders for his attempt to reach a nuclear deal with Iran as a summit outside Washington concluded on Thursday with the first glimpses of possible rapprochement on an issue that has alarmed many US allies in the region. The wooded cabins of the Camp David retreat have been the scene of many stalled attempts at Middle East peace in the past, and leaders from Saudi Arabia , in particular, remained cautious about aspects of the deal to contain Iran’s nuclear programme. But White House officials were optimistic of a possible breakthrough in attitudes more broadly after warmer than expected praise from the official delegation of six members of the Gulf Cooperation Council. “The president spoke about the … agreement with Iran and I am here to say that the GCC welcomes this agreement and we hope at the same time that this will be a key factor for stability in the region,” said the emir of Qatar , Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, as he stood alongside Obama. Officials from the Saudi delegation, which was without King Salman after he pulled out at the last minute, were less enthusiastic but echoed growing Gulf acceptance of the deal which is expected to be finalised in Switzerland next month. “We welcome any deal that stops Iran from having a nuclear capability and this is what we have been assured by the US and by the other P5+1 countries – that all pathways to a bomb will be closed to Iran,” the Saudi foreign minister, Adel al-Jubeir, told reporters in a separate briefing. The P5+1 is a group of six countries negotiating with Iran on its nuclear programme. We welcome any deal that stops Iran from having a nuclear capability. “Over the next six weeks the discussions will continue in order to see if this can be brought about, so it would be too early to prejudge what we accept and we don’t accept because we haven’t seen the final details,” Al-Jubeir added. Obama downplayed the apparent split between Saudi Arabia and Qatar, insisting it was to be expected that some would reserve final judgment until the agreement was completed. “We didn’t have a document that we presented to them to sign on the bottom line, ‘Will you approve of this nuclear framework deal?’ because the deal’s not completed,” he said. “What I did hear from our GCC partners was their agreement that if we can get a comprehensive, verifiable deal that cuts off the pathways to a nuclear weapon, that that would be in their interests.” Gulf leaders appeared reassured by US insistence that defence of Gulf states was a “fundamental tenet of American policy” and an “iron-clad commitment”, even though they failed to secure the formal defence agreement some had hoped for. Al-Jubeir insisted it was a mistake to regard the summit as a venue for horse-trading over specific concessions. “This was not a negotiation … this was a brainstorming session, a strategic meeting,” he said. Nonetheless the meeting took place against a backdrop of mounting hostility in the Gulf after Saudi strikes against Iranian-backed rebels in Yemen – tension which led to warning shots being fired at a Singapore-flagged ship in the Gulf earlier on Thursday. The Saudi delegation warned that the incident and a similar shipping clash several days ago threatened freedom of navigation in the Gulf. “What the Iranians have done with this ship and the Marshall Islands flagged ship is a clear violation of international law and the Iranians should not be allowed to get away with it,” Al-Jubeir told The Guardian. “I don’t know if they have done this to flex muscles, or whether they have done this to be provocative but for whatever reason they are doing it, it’s got to stop.” The White House also acknowledged the Iranian conventional forces remained a source of concern for many Gulf states. “There was a concern – a concern that I share – that even if we deal effectively with the nuclear issue, that we will still have a problem with some of Iran’s destabilising activities,” Obama told reporters in his press conference. “And a number of them did express the concern that with additional resources through the reduction in sanctions, that was it possible that Iran would siphon off a lot of these resources into more destabilising activity.” But the US sought to assuage such concerns by concluding the summit with a package of new measures aimed at bolstering missile and maritime defence capabilities of GCC member states."
"France balks at US plan for phased lifting of Iran nuclear sanctions","Negotiations are set to resume next week, only five days before deadline for agreement  Julian Borger in Lausanne and  Dan Roberts in Washington  Fri 20 Mar 2015 21.06 GMT   First published on Fri 20 Mar 2015 15.36 GMT   Negotiations over Iran’s nuclear programme will adjourn in Lausanne amid disagreements between the US and France over a common negotiating position with Tehran, according to diplomats at the talks. The US secretary of state, John Kerry, is due to meet his counterparts from the UK, France and Germany on Saturday, somewhere in Europe, to try to mend the rift – largely over the lifting of sanctions on Iran – and restore a united front. On Friday night, Barack Obama spoke by telephone to François Hollande about the talks. The talks with Iran are due to resume in Switzerland on Wednesday, which would leave just five days before a deadline for reaching a framework agreement. “We’ve had a series of intensive discussions with Iran this week, and given where we are in the negotiations, it’s an important time for high-level consultations with our partners in these talks,” US spokeswoman Marie Harf said. “Therefore, Secretary Kerry will travel tomorrow to meet in Europe with German foreign minister Steinmeier, British foreign secretary Hammond, and French foreign minister Fabius to discuss the ongoing … discussions with Iran.” Meanwhile, Republicans in the US Congress have also not given up their fight to block any agreement they believe is too lenient by refusing to lift certain sanctions. Despite criticising more hawkish Senate colleagues who sent a warning letter to Iran, foreign affairs chairman Bob Corker predicted on Friday that he will still be able to assemble enough support from Democrats to pass legislation forcing Obama to consult Congress. The official reason for the adjournment is the need for members of Iranian delegation to attend the funeral on Sunday of President Hassan Rouhani’s mother, who died on Friday aged 90. But the talks had already stalled because of differences over sanctions, and the emergence of splits within the group of six major powers on how tough a position to take. The sharpest split is between the US, which had proposed a scheme for a phased lifting of UN sanctions in return for concrete Iranian actions to limit its nuclear programme, and France, which wants to offer only a symbolic easing of the punitive measures imposed over the past decade. Diplomats say the French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, telephoned the French delegation in Lausanne to ensure it did not make further concessions, and to insist that the bulk of UN sanctions could only be lifted if Iran gave a full explanation of evidence suggesting it may have done development work on nuclear warhead design in the past. “We have been negotiating with Iran for 12 [years]. We shouldn’t be rushed into an agreement which will have to be comprehensive,” the French ambassador to Washington, Gerard Araud, tweeted during the talks. “For France, any agreement to be acceptable will have to give concrete guarantees on all issues. We won’t bypass any of them.” The French position is unacceptable to the Iranians, who argue they would never be able to prove a negative, and disprove evidence of a weapons programme they say is forged. “They don’t like it. They say it’s a deal-breaker. They don’t want it at all,” said a European diplomat involved in the talks. But the diplomat added there was “no way” France would relax its position. The US offer on sanctions is to lift UN sanctions in layers in return each “irreversible” step Iran makes to scale down and limit its nuclear programme. There would be mechanisms in place by which sanctions would “spring back” if Iran violated the agreement, without the need for consensus in the UN security council. It is broadly supported by the UK and Germany, while Russia and China, the other members of the six-nation group, would offer more generous terms. Tehran is reluctant to accept sanctions relief based on milestones, but diplomats say the French position would be a complete deal-breaker. They say the Iranians would be very unlikely to admit past weapons work, which if revealed would demonstrate that the country’s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, had misled the world. Better, US diplomats argue, to focus on limiting the current Iranian programme and worry about allegations about the past a few years down the road. US and French officials have also clashed in Lausanne over contrasting briefings their delegations have provided to the press. “Either there are real differences between the American and French positions or the French are posturing here in a way that is not helpful. So this meeting on Saturday will be helpful if it lets the Americans and French settle their differences,” said Reza Marashi, the research director at the National Iranian American Council. “Either the French are going to have to budge or the Americans are. But if the Americans budge that increases the likelihood that the Iranians are not going to be able to get to yes as an answer. President Obama called his French counterpart, Hollande, on Friday afternoon to discuss the talks, the White House said. According to a statement, the presidents “reaffirmed their commitment to achieving a long term comprehensive deal that fully and verifiably addresses the international community’s concerns about Iran’s nuclear program, while noting that Iran must take steps to resolve several remaining issues.” Kerry went to pay personal condolences to the president’s brother, Hossein Fereydoun, who had been attending the negotiations on the shores of Lake Geneva, but the gesture did not overcome the downbeat atmosphere overhanging the negotiations 11 days before a deadline to produce a framework agreement. Overnight, Obama issued a message marking the Iranian new year, Nowruz, saying: “We have the best opportunity in decades to pursue a different future between our countries.” But he added that it was up to Iran’s leaders to choose between two paths. “If they cannot agree to a reasonable deal, they will keep Iran on the path it’s on today – a path that has isolated Iran, and the Iranian people, from so much of the world,” Obama said. “On the other hand, if Iran’s leaders can agree to a reasonable deal, it can lead to a better path – the path of greater opportunities for the Iranian people.” Zarif quickly tweeted a riposte, saying it was the west that had to make the hard choices necessary for an deal. “Iranians have already made their choice: Engage with dignity. It’s high time for the US and its allies to chose: pressure or agreement,” he said. The latest session in the 18 months of negotations had begun hopefully. The central issue of Iran’s uranium enrichment capacity had been largely settled. Over the lifetime of a decade-long arrangement, it would have operating capacity equivalent to 6,000 of its current model centrifuges, a 40% reduction. However, that left unresolved what Iran would get in return. The EU is offering to lift its oil embargo and Iran’s exclusion from Swift electronic banking, while Obama is offering to suspend US congressional sanctions by presidential waiver. However, the Iranians see UN sanctions as crucial, because they declare the country’s nuclear programme to illegal and therefore justify all the other sanctions. “They consider it insulting and unfair that they would stay on the agenda of the security council, saying Iran is a threat to international peace and security,” a European negotiator said. “They say if we have a deal, we are not a threat any more.” The White House also still has an uphill battle back in Washington too. Administration officials insisted on Thursday it would refuse to sign any bill requiring Congressional approval of the deal, but senator Corker now claims he would be able to assemble a two-thirds majority in the House and Senate to override such a presidential veto. “I believe, in spite of some of the drama we have had over the last two weeks internally, we will have a veto proof majority to make that happen,” he told of meeting of Republican lawyers. “Some of my senator friends are being lobbied heavily by the administration but this is the sort of role that Congress should be playing,” added the Tennessee senator, who says he pushed back a planned vote until after the deadline for the Geneva talks to bring more Democrats on board. Speaking after his remarks on Friday, Corker acknowledged only certain US sanctions would be affected by Congressional disapproval but insisted this would remain a significant blow to any deal that fell short of what lawmakers felt was necessary. ‘We have got to have other countries involved for us to be most effective, but I still think the United States not being part of a deal going forward would have significant impact,” he told The Guardian. In a message uploaded to YouTube to mark the Iranian New Year celebration of Nowruz, US president Barack Obama appealed to the people of Iran to help bring about a peaceful diplomatic solution to the nation's nuclear talks. "We have to speak up for the future we seek," he implored. "This moment may not come again soon""
"Democrats Childishly Resist Trump’s North Korea Efforts","Advertisement Supported by By  Nicholas Kristof Opinion Columnist Shock! Horror! President Trump is actually doing something right. Sadly, Democrats in Congress are responding in a quite Trumpian way: They seem more concerned with undermining him than supporting a peace process with North Korea. They are on the same side as National Security Adviser John Bolton, quietly subverting attempts to pursue peace. While international security is complicated, here’s a rule of thumb: When you find yourself on the same side as Bolton, go back and re-examine your position. Sure, we all wish that Trump treated Justin Trudeau or Angela Merkel with the respect that he now shows Kim Jong-un. Yes, it seems that Trump has been played by Kim. Yet another way of putting it is that Trump is finally investing in the kind of diplomatic engagement that he used to denounce, and that we should all applaud. Trump’s newfound pragmatism is infinitely preferable to the threat of nuclear war that used to hang over all of us, so it’s mystifying to see Democrats carping about any possible North Korea deal. “Any deal that explicitly or implicitly gives North Korea sanctions relief for anything other than the verifiable performance of its obligations to dismantle its nuclear and missile arsenal is a bad deal,” seven Democratic senators, including Chuck Schumer, warned in a letter to Trump this week. The letter also insisted on “anywhere, anytime” inspections of suspected North Korean nuclear sites, as well as those linked to its chemical and biological warfare programs. It’s almost unimaginable that North Korea will allow such intrusive inspections — any country would resist having an enemy poke around its military bases, underground bomb shelters and border fortifications. So these Democrats are essentially saying that no plausible deal will pass muster. “The Democrats have gone overboard in the conditions they listed in the letter,” said Joel Wit, a North Korea watcher at the Stimson Center in Washington. “If they’re serious, it’s a prescription for failure because no one could achieve the conditions. It’s maybe payback for everything they were dealt in the Iran deal.” “It’s like role reversal,” Wit added. “For years Democrats criticized Republicans for not wanting to engage North Korea. Now that Republicans want to engage North Korea, the Democrats are preparing to criticize them.” Aside from Schumer, the Democratic senators who signed the letter are Sherrod Brown, Richard Durbin, Dianne Feinstein, Patrick Leahy, Robert Menendez and Mark Warner. I appreciate that it’s galling for Democrats to see Trump present himself as a great strategist who has forced North Korea to knuckle under. White House aide Larry Kudlow boasted on Fox News: “North Korea coming to the negotiating table has a lot do with President Trump’s very firm stand.” Poppycock. North Korean leaders have been eager for decades to meet with an American president; it’s just that no previous president agreed for fear of legitimizing the regime. It’s actually Trump who has made stunning compromises — holding a get-acquainted summit with Kim without any prospect of near-term denuclearization. The real hero here is South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in, who shrewdly used the Olympics to kick-start the peace process. Trump and Kim won’t get a Nobel Peace Prize, but if the peace process survives, Moon will be a worthy recipient. For decades, especially after Bill Clinton’s 1994 “Agreed Framework” with North Korea, it was conservative Republicans who were the spoilers on nuclear deals with North Korea and Iran alike. This G.O.P. petulance was bad for America. Bolton helped kill the Agreed Framework, so that North Korea hugely expanded its weapons program. Similar petulance led Trump and Bolton to try to destroy the Iran nuclear deal this spring; as a result, Iran this week announced that it was increasing its uranium enrichment capacity. Boy, that went well. Now a similar partisan petulance seems to be turning some Democrats into spoilers. Trump’s engagement with North Korea has been chaotic and should have begun with working-level talks, but it’s still better for leaders to exchange handshakes than missiles. Granted, there’s plenty of reason to be nervous about Trump’s deal making with North Korea, and plans can still collapse. How will Trump manage Kim when he can’t even manage a summit with the Philadelphia Eagles? Still, even if North Korea won’t hand over nuclear weapons in the next few years, I can imagine it committing in coming months to a sustained moratorium on nuclear tests and long-range missile tests, on production of plutonium and uranium fuel, on transfer of nuclear technology to other countries, such as Syria. North Korea might also destroy an ICBM or two and accept inspectors at its nuclear sites in Yongbyon. Trump and Kim might agree to exchange liaison offices and to declare peace on the Korean Peninsula. North Korea might well cheat, and these are half-steps, not rapid denuclearization. But half-steps toward peace are better than full strides toward war. Gail Collins is on book leave. Opinion Nicholas Kristof Opinion Nicholas Kristof Opinion Nicholas Kristof Advertisement"
"Iran and US close in on historic nuclear deal at Vienna talks","Julian Borger in Vienna  Sun 16 Nov 2014 16.56 GMT   Last modified on Thu 30 Nov 2017 05.15 GMT   Iran, the US and other world powers meeting in Vienna this week are close to a historic, comprehensive agreement that could bring a permanent end to 12 years of deadlock over Iran’s nuclear programme . With a deadline for the talks looming in a week’s time, diplomats are converging on the Austrian capital for the last stretch of marathon negotiations beginning Tuesday, with the outcome still in the balance. Compromises have been found on previously contentious issues, and detailed text for different versions of a final deal has been drafted. Some diplomats describe their work as 95% done, pending political decisions to be made in national capitals over Iran’s capacity to enrich uranium over the next few years, and the sequence in which international sanctions are lifted. Several leading arms-control experts have argued that the residual obstacles are more political than substantial, determined by the need of President Barack Obama’s administration and President Hassan Rouhani’s reformist government in Iran to reassure conservatives at home, rather than by the actual requirements of Iran’s nuclear energy programme or genuine nonproliferation concerns. There are also differences among the six-nation group involved in the negotiations with Iran. France has consistently been more opposed to nuclear concessions than the other five (the US, UK, Germany, Russia and China). John Kerry, the US secretary of state, flew to Paris on 4 November for talks with Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister, seeking assurances that he would not make a public intervention in the last few days of negotiations. In the closing stages of talks over the 2013 interim deal, Fabius warned against western concessions, saying Paris would not play along with a “fool’s game” . Accounts vary as to whether Kerry was able to secure a guarantee from Fabius not to break ranks in the eleventh hour of talks. “For Fabius, the ties with the Gulf Arabs – Saudi Arabia and Qatar – are much more important economically, and for French jobs in the next few years, than Iran,” said a French source familiar with the discussions. The Sunni monarchies in the Gulf are as opposed as Israel to western endorsement of an Iranian nuclear programme on any scale. The consequences of a collapse in the negotiations could be serious and rapid. The US Congress is poised to impose fresh sanctions on Iran, and after the Republican capture of the Senate in this month’s elections it will be hard for Obama to sustain a veto on new punitive measures. In response, hardliners in Tehran are likely to demand an end to the partial freeze on the Iranian programme negotiated in an interim agreement a year ago. Mutual escalation could quickly push the 12-year nuclear standoff back to the brink of war. Israel has repeatedly threatened to take military action if diplomacy fails to contain Iran’s nuclear aspirations. “I think extension is the least likely scenario because of the domestic political ramifications for all sides,” said Reza Marashi, a former state department official, who is research director of the National Iranian American Council in Washington . “In the words of the negotiators themselves: failure is not an option.” Given the high stakes, all sides at the Vienna talks will be extremely reluctant to break off negotiations if a complete agreement is not reached by 24 November, the deadline agreed in the interim deal, at Geneva a year ago. One option would be to announce a framework agreement, leaving gaps to be worked out later, or simply extend the talks. But neither option would be politically sustainable for long without proof of genuine progress. Congress is already sceptical of the talks, claiming Iran is playing for time. “It’s now or never,” said Jim Walsh, an expert on the Iranian nuclear programme at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “If you put this off six months, does Obama come back stronger, able to deliver a deal? Does Rouhani? No. “My hope is that, at the last moment, they stare into the abyss and realise the consequences of not doing a deal now are very, very bad.” Ali Vaez, an analyst at the International Crisis Group, suggested that, at most, the parties would have the remaining two months of the lame duck Congress to resolve the last remaining issues. Those outstanding obstacles, enrichment capacity and the sequence of sanctions relief, have long been the most politically charged and difficult issues on the table. The west is offering a temporary suspension of some US sanctions through a presidential waiver of measures imposed by Congress, along with the unfreezing of blocked Iranian assets around the world. The lifting of major oil and banking sanctions would be left until later. Tehran wants the permanent lifting of the major sanctions early in the lifetime of a deal, including those imposed by the UN security council. Iran has 19,000 centrifuges installed in two enrichment plants. Of those, 10,200 first-generation machines are in operation. The west would like that cut to fewer than 4,000 (the limits are measured in overall capacity, so a smaller number of more advanced centrifuges would be allowed), with the aim that it would take Iran a year to amass enough fissile material for a warhead, if Tehran took the decision to make a weapon. For its part, Iran does not want to cut capacity, and wants assurances that it will be allowed to expand in line with its nuclear energy needs. The rigid positions adopted by both sides have come under criticism from arms control experts. Daryl Kimball, of the Arms Control Association, pointed out that Russia had guaranteed the supply of fuel for Iran’s reactor at Bushehr and for at least two new reactors that Moscow and Tehran had agreed to build last week . “Iran’s practical need in the near term is close to zero,” said Kimball, the head of the association. “Tehran is within sight of a compromise on a linchpin issue. It would be a tragic and historic mistake if Iran passed up the chance for this agreement, if they refused to compromise in order to hold on to a couple of thousand old-fashioned, inefficient centrifuges.” Several nonproliferation specialists have also questioned the US-led insistence that Iran’s “breakout capacity” (the time it would take it to make a warhead) is kept to a year. Jeffrey Lewis, at the Monterey Institute of International Studies, said that if Iran wanted to make nuclear weapons, it would do so at covert sites rather than use facilities under constant international monitoring . “The Iranians are not going to use a declared facility. That would provoke an immediate crisis. Maybe they were be able to build one or two bombs but they would get hit,” said Lewis, who runs the ArmsControlWonk.com website. “If they were going to do it, they would do it in a covert facility. So everything we do should be focused on verification, not on numbers of declared centrifuges.” The guiding principle over nine months of talks on a comprehensive nuclear agreement has been that “nothing is solved until everything is solved”, reflecting the intertwined nature of the issues. But sources close to the talks say several difficult problems are close to a solution. • Lifetime of the deal – Iran originally wanted it to last no more than three years. The west wanted a 20-year deal. A likely compromise is in the eight- to 10-year range. • Cooperation with an International Atomic Energy Agency inquiry into alleged past Iranian development work on nuclear weapons – the IAEA would have to confirm full cooperation before the last major sanctions are lifted. • Heavy water reactor being build in Arak, central Iran – this would be redesigned to produce less plutonium as a byproduct. Iran would undertake not to build a reprocessing facility for extracting plutonium. • Underground enrichment site at Fordow – a small-scale research-and-development centre would be allowed under strict IAEA supervision • Transparency – Iran would accept a permanent IAEA presence at its nuclear facilities, while the agency would be able to inspect undeclared sites for signs of nuclear activity and monitor centrifuge-making plants. The negotiators could decide to bank those gains as the deadline of Monday night next week looms, issuing a statement on progress while asking for more time for the remaining obstacles – but that may not be enough to convince conservatives in the US and Iran to accept an extension."
"Head of Group Opposing Iran Accord Quits Post, Saying He Backs Deal","Advertisement Supported by By  Michael R. Gordon WASHINGTON — When the bipartisan advocacy group United Against Nuclear Iran decided last week to mobilize opposition against the nuclear deal with Tehran, Gary Samore knew he could no longer serve as its president. The reason: After long study, Mr. Samore, a former nuclear adviser to President Obama, had concluded that the accord was in the United States’ interest. “I think President Obama’s strategy succeeded,” said Mr. Samore, who left his post on Monday. “He has created economic leverage and traded it away for Iranian nuclear concessions.” As soon as Mr. Samore left, the group announced a new standard-bearer with a decidedly different message: Joseph I. Lieberman, the former senator from Connecticut and the new chairman of the group. “It’s a bad deal,” said Mr. Lieberman, who believes that lawmakers have a chance to block the accord even if that means overcoming a presidential veto. “If the Iranians are pressured more, I think we can get a better agreement.” To get that message across, the group has announced a multimillion-dollar television and digital media campaign. Yet it is Mr. Samore’s quiet departure as president of the organization that is resonating among the small community of experts who have pored over the agreement. Mr. Samore helped establish the organization in 2008, well before serious nuclear talks were underway. The aim was to strengthen the international economic sanctions against Iran, which Mr. Samore was convinced had been mounting a clandestine effort to develop nuclear weapons. Mr. Samore, who traveled to Iran in 2005, is well known to the Iranians. At a dinner that Mr. Samore attended during a meeting of the United Nations General Assembly in 2013, Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iran’s foreign minister, repeated assurances that Iran’s nuclear efforts were entirely peaceful. “We are all united against a nuclear Iran,” he quipped, as he cast a glance at Mr. Samore. Mr. Samore, who now runs the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard, initially said that the chances of a successful negotiation were dim. But after the framework of an accord was announced in Lausanne, Switzerland, in April, he praised it as a good first step. Mark D. Wallace, the chief executive of the group and a diplomat in the George W. Bush administration, said that the organization’s members had sought to keep an open mind. But after the final terms became clear, “The opposition was nearly unanimous,” he said. With that move, it was clear that Mr. Samore needed to move on. “We had an honest discussion that I wouldn’t be able to continue to serve as president if UANI was going to come out against the agreement, since I support it,” Mr. Samore said. “Nonetheless, I support the work that UANI has done in the past to strengthen sanctions, and I think they will have a role to play in the future to maintain nonnuclear sanctions if the deal goes forward,” he said. (He will continue to serve on the group’s advisory board.) Though he backs the accord as the most that can be achieved diplomatically, Mr. Samore is skeptical that the agreement will open a new chapter in American-Iranian relations. “The best you can achieve with diplomacy is delay in the hope that at some point a new Iranian government emerges that is not committed to developing nuclear weapons,” he said. And if that leadership does not materialize, Mr. Samore acknowledges that Iran might vastly expand its nuclear enrichment program after core elements of the agreement expire in 15 years. He is also not convinced that Iran will continue to adhere to the accord once economic sanctions are lifted. Even so, he argues, the accord will put the United States in a stronger position to respond than a congressional rejection would. “We will have bought a couple of years, and if Iran cheats or reneges we will be in an even better position to double down on sanctions or, if necessary, use military force,” Mr. Samore said. “If I knew for certain that in five years they would cheat or renege, I’d still take the deal.” Advertisement"
"Iranian migrant workers see nuclear deal as chance to leave Iraq","Many Iranian Kurds working in neighbouring Iraqi Kurdistan are anticipating an economic upturn in Iran so they can return to their families Haywa Ridha for Tehran Bureau  Fri 1 May 2015 14.55 BST   Last modified on Wed 15 Jun 2016 08.11 BST   In early April, many Iranians took to the streets of Tehran to celebrate the Lausanne framework agreement on Iran’s nuclear programme. But they weren’t the only ones cheering. Iranians living in the autonomous region of Iraqi Kurdistan were also enthusiastic about a possible thaw in relations between Iran and world powers. For many of these Iranians – mainly migrant workers of Kurdish ethnicity – this might be their ticket home. “The agreement will mean less pressure on Iran and it will lead to an improvement in the economic situation,” says Habib Abdullah Torordi, who works as a baker in the Iraqi Kurdish city of Sulaimaniya, sending his wages back to his wife and son in the Iranian city of Marivan, home to a mostly Kurdish population near the Iraqi border. “When the conditions improve, we will return to our homes. We don’t want to continue living this way.” After around 2007, when the economy in Iran was under strain from international sanctions and business in Iraqi Kurdistan was booming, many Iranian Kurds made the move, not because they were seeking asylum or opposed to the regime in Tehran but simply to earn money. Sulaimaniya, the second largest in Iraqi Kurdistan, is just 90 minutes’ drive from the border. There was a wider influx of migrant workers into Iraqi Kurdistan, with labourers from Asia and Africa working in construction while a newly affluent class needed cleaners, maids and cafe workers. But Iranians of Kurdish ethnicity often had an advantage because they shared the culture and language. “It would still be better for us to work in our own country,” explains Bakhtiar Saidi, an Iranian working as a tattooist in the Iraqi town of Ranya in a mountainous area near the Iranian border. He says most of the Iranians he knows would go back home if the economy there improved. Nobody seems to know how many Iranian Kurds are in Iraqi Kurdistan. The ministry of labour and social affairs in Iraqi Kurdistan has counted over 15,000 foreign workers entering the region since 2009 but they don’t know how many are Iranian. One local journalist told a 2011 fact-finding mission by the Danish immigration service he thought there might be as many as 30,000 Iranian migrant workers in Iraqi Kurdistan. Part of the reason for the lack of realistic figures is that many Iranians looking for employment arrive on 15-day tourist visas, and then stay without work or residence permits. Iranians who want to work legally have to pass through time-consuming bureaucratic hoops. Part of the process involves registering with the local security forces known as the Asayesh, Iraqi Kurdish intelligence. Iranian Kurds say that they have to wait a long time for permits, if they get them at all. They may have to return to application offices several times and often permits last just one to six months before a return visit is required. Even if they get a permit, they say they will often still be summoned for questioning by the Asayesh. “Many of my relatives and friends work in the Kurdistan region but their lives are not easy and they don’t always feel comfortable because of local security that is directed against Iranians here,” says Saidi, the tattooist. This flies in the face of an official Kurdish nationalism that says all Kurds – whether from Iran, Turkey, Syria or Iraq – are welcome. “One of the main reasons is fear of terrorism,” suggests local journalist Zanko Ahmad who is based in Sulaimaniya. “According to the Asayesh an Iranian was involved in bombings in Irbil [capital of the Kurdish region] in August last year.” “The Asayesh don’t always act logically,” says another local journalist, based in Irbil. “They may just be worried about strangers.” Interviews conducted by Human Rights Watch with Iranians seeking asylum in Iraq – as opposed to migrant workers – suggest that the Asayesh also suspect Iranians could be spies. Activists seeking refuge in Iraqi Kurdistan also say security forces have told them not to cause trouble, for fear of offending the Iranian regime. It’s not just security issues that make life increasingly difficult for Iranians in Iraqi Kurdistan. The downturn in the region’s economic fortunes is also having an impact on migrant workers. Political disputes between Iraqi Kurdistan and the federal government in Baghdad has starved the Kurdish economy of cash, with Baghdad at first unwilling and now apparently unable to send the region its share of the federal budget. Coupled with the security crisis caused by the extremist group known as the Islamic State or Isis, this has brought a major downturn in the Kurdish boom towns over the past year. Which is why some locals are saying that migrant workers are just another burden. “The presence of foreign workers leads to higher unemployment,” argues Omar Mohammed, head of the branch of a local trade union, the Kurdistan Worker’s Syndicate, in the district of Garmian, near the Iranian border. “Foreign workers will do all kinds of jobs for a pittance but locals won’t accept such low wages.” “Iranian workers have become a burden as they reduce job opportunities for the citizens of the region,” complains Abdul Majid, who heads Sulaimaniya province’s department of labour. “We want to try and organise them so that their negative impact is reduced.” But with no such improvements imminent, workers are eyeing home. “If I am not granted a residency permit for Sulaimaniya, I can’t see my family more than three times a year,” complains Mustafa Yazdan Bann, who has left his wife and two daughters over the border in Kermanshah. Bann is a fine arts graduate and a painter but works on construction sites and part time in a hotel. “We are waiting to see what happens next,” he says. “And to see in which direction Iran will move. If the sanctions are lifted and the Iranian economy improves and things get more comfortable, I will return to Iran. I won’t stay away from my family any longer than I have to.”"
"Repression in Iran is getting worse: Trump must share the blame","Thu 14 Jun 2018 16.16 BST   Last modified on Fri 15 Jun 2018 04.18 BST   T he arbitrary arrest and jailing of Nasrin Sotoudeh , a leading Iranian human rights lawyer, is a crude act of state aggression against a courageous individual, and another heavy blow to the rule of law in Iran. It comes amid an intensifying judicial crackdown on dissent, in particular on women protesters who refuse to wear the hijab in public. This, in turn, forms part of a wider, epic struggle for Iran’s democratic future. Sotoudeh has a long, proud record of challenging Iran’s powerful clerical establishment – but always within the legal framework of the post-1979 constitution. Her defence of political dissidents, juvenile offenders on death row, and the Nobel peace prize-winner, Shirin Ebadi , brought fame and persecution. In 2010 Sotoudeh was detained in Tehran’s Evin prison, accused of “acting against national security” and “spreading propaganda”. She endured harsh and lengthy interrogations and, despite the obvious bias of her accusers in Iran’s intelligence ministry, was sentenced to 11 years behind bars. She was released in 2013 after an apparent intervention by Hassan Rouhani, Iran’s newly elected, politically moderate president and an international campaign waged on her behalf. In 2012, she had been awarded the European parliament’s Sakharov prize. Now she has been targeted again as Iran’s political climate deteriorates. Sotoudeh’s arrest at her Tehran home on Wednesday follows her latest confrontation with Iran’s judiciary over attempts to limit a defendant’s access to a lawyer in security-related cases. Only a handful of lawyers will be allowed in future to take on cases involving activists and dissidents, and they must first be state-approved. The judiciary’s move is illegal. Iran’s constitution sets no limits or conditions on the right to legal counsel. Article 35 states: “Both parties to a lawsuit have the right in all courts of law to select an attorney”. But Sadegh Larijani, head of the judiciary, says the new restrictions are in the public interest. Sotoudeh’s reaction was withering. “In the past, political suspects had a limited right to defend themselves and lawyers could take up their cases and carry out their professional duties, despite all the dangers they faced. But now, even that limited right is being completely eliminated,” she said earlier this month. After refusing a court summons in November, she insisted she was exercising her freedom of expression “within the boundaries of the law”. She added: “It really doesn’t matter what I am accused of. I know I will not be treated fairly by the judiciary.” Amid reports that Sotoudeh has already been sentenced without trial to five years, international condemnation has been swift. “The Iranian judiciary should cease its cowardly and unlawful actions of jailing and harassing human rights lawyers,” said Hadi Ghaemi of the independent, US-based Center for Human Rights in Iran. Amnesty International called Sotoudeh’s arrest an outrage. Sotoudeh has also been leading the defence of women threatened with draconian punishments for defying customary rules governing the wearing of the hijab in public. Since December 2017, dozens of women have been violently attacked and arrested for peacefully protesting against “compulsory veiling”. Since Vida Movahed removed her white headscarf and waved it like a flag during a demonstration in Tehran , what Sotoudeh calls a “national movement” has gathered pace, spearheaded by the “Girls of Revolution Street” campaigners and online groups such as My Stealthy Freedom . Sotoudeh represents Narges Hosseini , a protester charged with “encouraging immorality or prostitution” by removing her scarf. She faces up to 10 years in jail and 74 lashes. “Ms Hosseini objects to the forced hijab and considers it her legal right to express her protest,” Sotoudeh said in February. “She is not prepared to say she is sorry.” The crackdown on dissent follows demonstrations across Iran in December that were sparked by economic woes but quickly became anti-regime in nature. It also comes in the context of a losing battle by European countries to maintain lines of communication with Rouhani after Donald Trump reneged on the 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran , reimposed swingeing sanctions, and implied support for forcible regime change. Trump argued his action would force Iran to change its behaviour for the better. Instead, conservative hardliners appear to be extending their grip on Iranian society as part of a renewed bid to undermine the moderate forces around Rouhani. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian citizen held since 2016 , is another innocent victim of this struggle. After her release from jail, Sotoudeh, who is married with two children, told me in Tehran in 2014 about her incarceration and the solitary horrors she was forced to endure . But she never wavered in her belief that her career of defiance was both morally and legally justified. Sotoudeh said she felt guilty about being freed. “I have a very bad feeling about the other women prisoners that I left behind,” she said. Now, sadly, she has rejoined them. • Simon Tisdall is a foreign affairs commentator"
"Pope Issues Law, With Penalties, for Vatican City to Address Sexual Abuse","Advertisement Supported by By  Jason Horowitz and Elisabetta Povoledo ROME — Pope Francis has issued a highly anticipated law for Vatican City officials and diplomats overseas to tackle sexual abuse, setting up what is intended to be a model for the Roman Catholic Church worldwide by requiring, for the first time, that accusations be immediately reported to Vatican prosecutors. The Vatican characterized the law — and accompanying pastoral guidelines — as a reflection of the most advanced thinking on preventing and addressing sexual abuse in the church. The law, dated March 26, calls on church authorities to listen immediately to people who say they are victims and to report any credible allegations to prosecutors. Those who fail to report could be subjected to financial penalties and jail time. “Protection of minors and vulnerable people is an essential part of the evangelical message that the church and all of its members are called to spread across the world.” the pope wrote in a personal edict enacting the law. Francis said he wanted to “strengthen the institutional and regulatory framework to prevent and tackle abuses against minors and vulnerable people.” In a statement on Friday, Alessandro Gisotti, the Vatican’s spokesman, said that Pope Francis had hoped that though the measures applied to the Vatican City State and its administration, “everyone might develop in their awareness that the church must always be ever increasingly a safe home for children and vulnerable persons.” The pope wrote, “Everyone’s awareness increases that abuses need to be reported to the competent authorities, and for the need to cooperate with them in prevention and counteraction activities.” But the law also makes clear that clerics should be presumed innocent until proven guilty, and that if condemned in a fair Vatican trial, they should be removed from their posts and, in the case of a priest, be subjected to the penalties of canon law. In fact, the pope, who has made mercy a cornerstone of his pontificate, provided for the care of those found guilty. Francis wrote that those convicted of “abuse against minors or vulnerable people should be removed from their responsibilities and, at the same time, given an adequate support for psychological and spiritual rehabilitation, also with the goal of social reintegration.” Church officials had announced that the law was in the works at the conclusion of a meeting last month of leading bishops and cardinals at the Vatican to address the scourge of clergy sexual abuse. Francis had convened the meeting amid a renewed sense of crisis in the church. Civil investigations into abuse by Catholic clerics in the United States,  Australia , Chile , France and other countries had exposed once again the systemic problem of abusive priests exploiting their office and prelates covering up misconduct. The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the church’s doctrinal watchdog, is also expected to issue to its bishops around the world a handbook of best practices for preventing and reporting abuse in the church. But if the Vatican aimed to present this as a model for bishops’ conferences worldwide, associations that advocate for victims complained that the new edict fell short of their ambitions. The mandatory reporting provision stipulates “that those reports should be made to internal Vatican prosecutors, not independent and secular law enforcement officials,” said a statement from SNAP, the Survivors Network for abuse victims. The association said that recent history made clear “that the church cannot police itself,” and that the new law should have made mandatory reporting to local police and prosecutors first. Mr. Gisotti, the Vatican’s spokesman, noted that the three documents issued by the pope responded to “the concrete demands expressed by the People of God to address the scourge of the sexual abuse of minors.” Together, they “reinforce the protection of minors by strengthening the normative framework,” he added. The three documents signed by Francis — the personal edict on the protection of minors and vulnerable persons; the new law for the Vatican City State that extends to the Roman Curia; and the pastoral guidelines — “somehow represent the first fruit” of the meeting held at the Vatican last month, Andrea Tornielli, the editorial director of the Vatican’s Dicastery for Communication, wrote in an explanatory note released by the Vatican. Though the norms and guidelines refer specifically to the Vatican State, where, Mr. Tornielli noted, there are many clerics but “very few children,” he said they were nevertheless “exemplary” in that they took into account “the most advanced international” thinking on the matter. In the personal edict, the pope affirms a “significant principle,” Mr. Tornielli wrote. “Everyone must become aware of the duty to report abuses to the competent authorities and to cooperate with them” in preventing abuses. The fact that the pope also signed the other two documents, which could have been issued by other Vatican institutions, “indicates the importance he wanted to give these norms,” Mr. Tornielli wrote. The pastoral guidelines drafted for Vatican City are considerably shorter than those drafted by bishops’ conferences around the world, given that there are only two parishes in Vatican City and few children residing there, he noted. The new law has many significant measures: All crimes relating to the abuse of minors, not just those of a sexual nature, will be dealt with automatically, even in the absence of a specific complaint. The law also establishes “the obligation to report and to sanction the public official who fails to report to the Vatican judicial authority abuses of which he has become aware,” except through confession. Those sanctions would apply to members of the Vatican State, the Roman Curia and diplomatic personnel at the service of the nunciatures, who function as public officials, as do more than 90 percent of those who work in the Vatican or for the Holy See. But the law did not make clear whether Vatican diplomats working in embassies abroad should report to the local authorizes there, and the Vatican did not respond to a request for clarification. “Will the Holy See use these new laws to keep in house criminal proceedings against cardinals and Vatican diplomats accused of crimes in other countries?,” Anne Barrett Doyle, co-director of BishopAccountability.org, which documents abuses in the Roman Catholic Church, said in a statement. She called the law “a baby step in the right direction,” but said it fell short of the “bold, broad reforms” that Pope Francis could enact, including changing canon law. Though the edict includes some recommendations made by victims groups to summit organizers last month, some measures were not feasible, Francesco Zanardi, the president of Rete L’Abuso, the first support group for clerical abuse survivors in Italy, said in a statement. Mr. Zanardi welcomed, for example, the establishment inside the Vatican of a structure that would provide medical and psychological help to abuse victims, but wondered whether they had to travel to the Vatican to get the support. “This is unacceptable,” he said. The law also says “vulnerable people” — including the sick, people with a physical or mental disability, and people with limited personal freedom — are entitled to the same protection as minors. “It’s an important clarification because it extends to adults who might not be able to resist abuse because they are in situations where they are in positions of inferiority to their superiors,” said Gerard O’Connell, a journalist who has long covered the Vatican. It could also extend to clerics who sexually abuse nuns. Critics, though, pointed to what they said was a major gap in the law — the failure to enact what Peter Isely, a survivor from Milwaukee and a founding member of the group Ending Clergy Abuse , which gathers victims from 17 countries, called “zero tolerance.” “Any priest that has been determined to have abused a minor must be removed permanently form ministry and, we think, then laicized,” said Mr. Isely in a telephone interview. Nor did the pope remove the statute of limitations for reporting crimes. Instead, the new law sets it at 20 years from reaching adulthood. “We know that for victims of abuse, reporting is delayed, well past the age of 38 for most victims,” Mr. Isely said. “It’s not true that this is the most advanced law of its kind,” he continued. “The danger is presenting this as the model and as the most advanced and complete model for bishops around the world.” Gaia Pianigiani contributed reporting.

"Republicans hate the Iran nuclear deal because it means we won't bomb Iran","The Administration’s agreement with Iran would curtail the latter’s nuclear program. The only people who can hate that are the kind who just love war Contact author  Tue 14 Jul 2015 19.41 BST   Last modified on Fri 14 Jul 2017 17.33 BST   As soon as President Obama announced the historic nuclear agreement between the US and Iran on Tuesday, Republican presidential candidates raced to see who could get out the most hyperbolic, foaming-at-the-mouth condemnation of the potential for peace. Republicans frontrunner Jeb Bush was first out of the gate, more than 24 hours before the deal was actually signed. He boasted on his YouTube channel : “History is full of examples of when you enable people or regimes who don’t embrace democratic values you get a bad result...it’s called appeasement.” One wonders what Jeb thought when his brother, George W Bush, was cutting deals (and becoming close allies) with two of the most notorious dictators on earth at the time, Libya’s Muammar Gaddafi and Syria’s Bashir al-Assad . And speaking of regimes who don’t embrace democratic values, how long after Jeb is sworn in as president will he literally be holding hands with the unelected and ruthless King of Saudi Arabia, like his brother? man, ever since george bush negotiated that nuclear deal with libya, qaddafi's regime has really been unstoppable Senator Lindsay Graham, who has never met a war he didn’t like, lamented to Bloomberg’s Josh Rogin : “My initial impression is that this deal is far worse than I ever dreamed it could be and will be a nightmare for the region, our national security and eventually the world at large.” A failure to reach a deal with Iran would have almost certainly have led to a military confrontation , so naturally poor Lindsay is sad that a small portion of the Middle East will now likely be off the table for bombing. Indeed, what a nightmare. Graham also called the deal “possible death sentence for Israel.” How a deal that would delay the chances of Iran getting a bomb by decades is a death sentence for Israel, a country which already has dozens or hundreds of nuclear weapons and a far more powerful military than Iran, is anyone’s guess. Others, like Wisconsin Scott Walker, claimed that “this deal will likely lead to a nuclear arms race in the world’s most dangerous region.” Let’s put aside the fact that Iran hasn’t actively been pursuing a nuclear bomb, as US intelligence agencies have acknowledged for years. Republicans will happily ignore that the only country in the Middle East that has not signed on to the Nuclear Arms Proliferation Treaty in the region is Israel. Who cares if no Republican has read the full text of the deal, which won’t be given to Congress for days ? And who cares that, if you spent 30 seconds applying their twisted logic to Republican presidents, it would make no sense? Republicans, who were always reflexively against any deal that would limit the Iranians’ nuclear program and may stave off war, seem downright furious diplomacy prevailed over the threat of more missiles. Many of the Republicans’ statements on Iran in the past few months have just a word salad of insults – “evil”, “malevolent”, “corrupt”, “terrorists”, “the devil” – as though there were a contest to see how many despicable adjectives they could fit into one paragraph. Many of today’s statements then immediately condemned the fact that in Iran crowds sometimes chant “Death to America”. Gee, I wonder why a few people in Iran say hyperbolic things about the US? It’s not like our leading politicians would ever sing songs about blowing up Iran – oh, wait . Now the big criticism , just like when the framework from the deal was announced months ago, is that the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, was smiling and telling his people that Iran got a good deal. Of course he’s telling his people it’s a good deal, just like Obama is telling that to Americans. What do they expect Rouhani to do – get on national television and start crying about how they were brilliantly out negotiated and are now forever screwed? For Republicans, the Iran nuclear negotiations have never been about getting “a good deal” for the US. They’ve simply wanted to preserve their ability to kill people in the Middle East whenever they want, and continue to indulge their fetish of American superpower . It doesn’t matter to Republicans whether bombing Iran virtually guarantees that actually will pursue a nuclear bomb (which, again, right now they’re not), or that a deal will hurt the hardliners in Iran that Republicans profess to hate. It only matters that they continue to have an enemy to bomb in the Middle East, and a President to criticize here at home."
"Binyamin Netanyahu denounces Iran nuclear negotiations","Israeli prime minister says emerging deal in Lausanne ‘confirms all of our fears and worse’ as deadline for framework for agreement approaches  Julian Borger in Lausanne  Sun 29 Mar 2015 14.09 BST   Last modified on Wed 29 Nov 2017 21.01 GMT   Binyamin Netanyahu has denounced an agreement being negotiated in Switzerland on Iran’s nuclear programme, saying it was “even worse” than Israel had feared. According to the Haaretz news website , the Israeli prime minister claimed there was an “Iran-Lausanne-Yemen” axis, linking the venue for the nuclear talks with Iranian backing for Houthi rebels in Yemen , and said the deal posed a threat to humanity that must be stopped. “I am deeply troubled by the emerging agreement with Iran in the nuclear talks,” said Netanyahu at the start of a cabinet meeting on Sunday. “The agreement confirms all of our fears and even worse.” Netanyahu made his remarks as negotiations in Lausanne approached the 31 March deadline for an understanding on the framework for a deal, and took on a new intensity. The UK foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, and his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, arrived at the Swiss lakeside town on Sunday evening to join the US secretary of state, John Kerry, and foreign ministers from Iran, France, Germany and China, as well as the EU foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini . Kerry cancelled a flight to Boston, where he had been due to attend a memorial ceremony for his late friend, senator Edward Kennedy , on Monday. The French and German foreign ministers, Laurent Fabius and Frank-Walter Steinmeier, postponed a trip to Astana, Kazakhstan, where they had been due to take part in negotiations on Ukraine with Russian officials. “A comprehensive nuclear deal with Iran is in all our interests. It is the best way of ensuring Iran does not develop a nuclear weapons capability. That is why the UK is putting such extensive effort into these negotiations,” Hammond said on arrival. “Both sides now need to work intensively to bridge the remaining differences. That will mean some tough choices if we are to reach what would be a historic deal.” Asked if he was optimistic about the prospects of an agreement, Lavrov replied: “I am not paid to be optimistic.” The diplomats have until the Tuesday night deadline for a framework agreement. Negotiators would then have three more months to draft technical annexes to complete the deal. A senior US official predicted that the talks could go all the way to the Tuesday deadline, adding the unresolved issues included the duration of any agreement, between 11 and 15 years, how much development work on centrifuges Iran could carry out over the lifetime of the deal, and the phased lifting of UN security council sanctions. Kerry has to present specific details to Congress to fend off new sanctions on Iran. Iranian officials do not want a formal accord, in part because the country’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, decreed last month that there could be only a signed agreement at the very end of the process. The Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said there was a danger that any agreed text would become a target for opponents of any deal. “My fear is a two-page document is a paper tiger. Anybody can kill it,” Zarif told NBC News. A possible solution is for the foreign ministers to make a joint declaration in Lausanne or in nearby Geneva, to be followed by the publication of an informal “factsheet” of agreed points, that could be officially deniable in Tehran. A former state department official said it could take several days to draft this, so experts could stay behind after the foreign ministers leave, to work on the document before Congress reconvenes in mid-April. However, a European official at the talks said they were still mired in issues of substance, and had yet to tackle differences over presentation. “We will remain at the negotiation table for however long it takes to get a good deal,” the Iranian deputy foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi. He added: “All the sides are strongly motivated to reach a compromise.”"
"No. 2 Negotiators in Iran Talks Argue Physics Behind Politics","Advertisement Supported by By  David E. Sanger LAUSANNE, Switzerland — At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the mid-1970s, Ernest J. Moniz was an up-and-coming nuclear scientist in search of tenure, and Ali Akbar Salehi, a brilliant Iranian graduate student, was finishing a dissertation on fast-neutron reactors. The two did not know each other, but they followed similar paths once they left the campus: Mr. Moniz went on to become one of the nation’s most respected nuclear physicists and is now President Obama’s energy secretary. Mr. Salehi, who was part of the last wave of Iranians to conduct nuclear studies at America’s elite universities, returned to an Iran in revolution and rose to oversee the country’s nuclear program . Forty years later, they are facing off in intense one-on-one talks as the deadline approaches for a nuclear deal that could be one of the most important, and disputed, international accords in decades. Mr. Moniz and Mr. Salehi have emerged as their countries’ No. 2 negotiators, a pair of atomic diplomats taking on the vast technical issues that lie beneath the political disagreements. Their roles as deputies to the chief negotiators — Secretary of State John Kerry and Mohammad Javad Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister — signal that the two sides are down to the hardest issues about the kind of nuclear infrastructure Iran will be permitted to retain, and in recent days, those discussions have hit major road blocks. The two had met only once before, in Vienna, more than a decade ago. But in the last five weeks, they have negotiated alone for more than 20 hours. “We have a good rapport,” Mr. Moniz said as he poured himself a glass of well-aged Scotch and settled into the living room of his Lausanne suite, overlooking Lake Geneva. Over time, he said, Mr. Salehi has dropped his formality (Mr. Moniz calls him Ali), and the two now disappear for hours at a time into the conference rooms at the Beau-Rivage Palace Hotel, where the dismantlement of the Ottoman Empire was negotiated nearly a century ago. The question is whether it is possible to dismantle enough of Iran’s nuclear infrastructure to assure the United States and its allies that they would have enough warning to stop Iran if it tried to build a nuclear bomb. Mr. Moniz, 70, understands his role well: He is providing not only technical expertise but also political cover for Mr. Kerry. If a so-called framework agreement is reached in the next few days, it will be Mr. Moniz who will have to vouch to a suspicious Congress, to Israel and to Arab allies that Iran would be incapable of assembling the raw material for a single nuclear weapon in less than a year. What the United States and Iran want out of discussions over Iran’s nuclear development. “It wouldn’t mean much coming from Kerry,” said a member of the administration deeply involved in the strategy who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “The theory is that Ernie’s judgment on that matter is unassailable.” Mr. Salehi, 66, will have his own problems selling an agreement to the generals and clerics in Tehran, many of whom are suspicious of Iran’s Western-educated negotiators and will have to be convinced that Iran has not backed down in the face of American demands. In recent days, Mr. Salehi has taken a decidedly positive tone in public, suggesting that all technical disputes with the United States have been resolved — a move some American officials interpret as an effort to put the blame squarely on Washington if the talks fail. “For both sides, there are big questions of optics and politics here,” Mr. Moniz said. People who know both men say they have more in common than challenges at home. They are “mirror images in different contexts, both very personable,” said Michael J. Driscoll, an emeritus professor of nuclear science and engineering at M.I.T. who advised Mr. Salehi on his dissertation. Over the years, Mr. Salehi fell out of contact with Mr. Driscoll and many of his M.I.T. colleagues, who were warned after the 1979 Iranian revolution, which swept out the Washington-supported shah and brought to power a virulently anti-American Islamic leadership, that corresponding with Mr. Salehi could place him in jeopardy. Mr. Salehi and Mr. Moniz converged a little more than a month ago in the increasingly tense talks, brought together after the Iranians announced that Mr. Salehi, a former foreign minister who represented Iran at the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, would have a seat at the negotiating table. It was a telling move: Mr. Salehi is considered close to Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and behind the scenes in Tehran, he had just killed an American proposal to reconfigure Iran’s centrifuges in a way that would have made them far less capable of producing enriched uranium. Soon, Mr. Moniz received a call from the White House: He would become Mr. Kerry’s negotiating partner. Mr. Moniz was well suited for the job: After becoming energy secretary nearly two years ago, he brought in scientists from the United States’ national laboratories to work out options to present to the Iranians, based in part on a secret replica of Iran’s facilities that the United States built when it was mapping out cyberattacks against them during the Bush administration. “Ernie loves to sit with these technical experts and challenge their conclusions,” said Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall, the deputy energy secretary. “I often see him doing the math in his head.” Mr. Moniz’s arrival has, by all accounts, changed the dynamic of the negotiating sessions. “Occasionally, a scientist drops into the government at just the right time, with just the right expertise,” said John M. Deutch, a former director of the Central Intelligence Agency who appointed Mr. Moniz years ago as the head of M.I.T.’s nuclear physics laboratory. “And that’s what’s happened here.” As Iran and world powers including the United States try to reach a deal on nuclear controls in exchange for the lifting of sanctions, Iranians from all walks of life are watching and hoping for a new start. The Moniz-Salehi talks are a way to separate the heated arguments over sanctions and national sovereignty from a far more technical discussion that only two nuclear scientists could love. They have spent much of their time in recent days arguing about the type and power of the advanced centrifuges Iran says it wants to continue developing during the 10 or more years of an agreement — one of the last stumbling blocks in the talks. “We spend a lot of time on SWU,” Mr. Moniz said, referring to separative work units — the acronym is pronounced “swoo” in nuclear-speak — which underlie all the calculations about how long it would take Iran to produce a single bomb’s worth of enriched uranium. It is not the favorite subject of many State Department diplomats. Mr. Moniz has also reached out to his vast network of nuclear scientists in the United States, giving them classified briefings about the details of the talks. His hope is that they will provide technical validation to Congress and nervous allies that the plan negotiated with Tehran will give enough warning time to head off an Iranian race for a nuclear weapon with economic pressure or, if need be, a bombing run. Mr. Moniz, who was born in 1944 in Fall River, Mass., got hooked on science as a high school student in the post-Sputnik era of the late 1950s and early 1960s. After attending Boston College, he earned a doctorate in theoretical physics from Stanford and then he joined the faculty at M.I.T., where he fell in with a group of physicists who were active in the Union of Concerned Scientists and similar groups. He soon found himself immersed in questions about managing the “nuclear fuel cycle” technology that was giving emerging nations the capability to build power reactors — and nuclear weapons . The spread of that bomb-making technology was an unintended consequence of President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s “ Atoms for Peace ” program. Mr. Moniz has spent the rest of his career trying to undo the damage. “What couldn’t be realized back then,” he said, “was how fast the technology would create ‘threshold states’ ” on the verge of nuclear weapons. Iran is the classic example. Mr. Salehi, who was born in 1949 in Iraq, studied in Lebanon at the American University of Beirut and went on to become chancellor of Iran’s Sharif University of Technology. Britain and other European nations have put him on sanctions lists, and he has been dogged by suggestions that he knew of shipments of banned technologies to Iran. When M.I.T. invited him to speak on campus a number of years ago, the State Department blocked his appearance, saying he could not leave the neighborhood near the United Nations in New York. This weekend, Mr. Salehi and Mr. Moniz are talking once again, mostly to resolve the dispute about whether research on new centrifuges will take Iran too close to bomb-making capability. But they are clearly bound by an old-school tie: Mr. Salehi recently became a grandfather for the first time, and Mr. Moniz showed up with baby gifts, each embossed with the M.I.T. logo. Michael R.

"Mr. Big Mouth","Advertisement Supported by Our Man in Tehran - Episode 4 By  Thomas Erdbrink A. I have visited six or seven countries including Turkey, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Syria. To me, Turkey was the best. The people and the police were really hospitable. I have good memories from this country. I could even meet with the Turkish science minister very easily. I shook hands with him and we had a conversation. A. I do not think sanctions will be lifted or suspended. Why should the U.S. want to remove them at all? The United States is not crazy enough to suspend the sanctions. And, even if they remove the sanctions, it will not have any effect on people’s lives because the value of the dollar will never decrease very much, and prices keep going up. All they are doing is playing a political game. They will never return the money that they have been taking from this country since the discovery of oil here in Iran. They are used to taking Iran’s money away. Putting sanctions on Iran is the safest way for them to prevent Iran from developing. If they bomb Iran and level the country, nothing useful remains for them. But, by keeping the sanctions, they prevent Iran from progress and development. Therefore, I am sure that they will not ease the sanctions. A. Iran ranks first considering its Islamic position in the region. Imam Khomeini [Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini] said that we would export our revolution, and we did. But, other countries do not have such great and understanding people as we do, and they are not independent. So, their revolutions failed. The reason that we could protect our revolution is that we are a self-sufficient nation. We can make everything. I can say that we are about 60 percent independent from other countries. We just need to produce medicines and airplanes. If we can do that, there will be no need to import anything from abroad. And, on a larger scale, Iran is the seventh country in the world, right after the P5-plus-1 countries . Because we are able to make the products that we need and then we are independent. A. Saudi Arabia is the most miserable country of the world. I have been to Saudi Arabia. There are many poor people in that country. You see lots of beggars in the streets. It is not just Saudi Arabia; all of the Arab countries have been under pressure and are broken. Believe me: I am sure that the Saudi government will be toppled in a year. Compared to Arab countries in general, here in Iran, our people have a better life. For example, I get 182,000 tomans — around $55 — as a monthly cash subsidy for our family of four people that I can use to pay all of my electricity, water and gas bills. It is wonderful here in Iran. A. People of one country are no different from their government. The American government is the same as its people, and its people are the same as their government. Look at Israelis: They have occupied Palestinians’ lands, and as long as they have weapons, those poor Palestinian people do not dare get their properties back. These nations have been created satanic. We can never trust Americans’ good deeds. We have nothing to do with them. We just want them to leave us alone to live our lives. But, if they compensate us for all of the damages they caused in our country, like compensating the martyrs’ families who have been suffering and endured losses during the war, it might help, and then our politicians might change their minds about them. It is the only way that families of the martyrs, families of the veterans and those whose sons and husbands have been held captive for years might get relief because it will make them feel as if they have gained what they wanted. A. If I had some power in this country, I would like to do three things: One, I would establish an extensive health insurance program that covers all of the treatment expenses of the people. It should be for everyone in the country. Two, I would make our schools and universities free for studying, and no one would have any worries about university fees. Three, I would amend the employment situation and would focus on employment contracts to prevent employers from illegally firing any worker or employee. It would result in increased job security. No worker should be stressed when they are going to bed at night; they should not be afraid of losing their job the next day. Date of Birth: April 30, 1969 Hometown: Tehran Education: I received my diploma in architecture. But later I received my B.A. in international law from Tehran University of Applied Science and Technology. I also studied public relations in another branch of the same university in Tehran. What is your greatest wish in life? My first and greatest wish in life is to help my country and serve my people. Sincerely. People, like chess pieces, each with their own movements, should serve and protect their system. I like to serve my country based on our leader’s orders. If, one day, he asks us to shake hands with the Satan, the United States, we will do that. To serve the people, one should listen carefully to the leader. How many children do you have and what do they do? I have two sons. One of them has just finished his obligatory 24-month military service. He just started working for a milk-production company. My younger son is about 12 or 13. He is a junior high school student. How do you feel about a possible nuclear deal with the United States and other world powers? I do not accept this deal. I think every detail regarding the deal must be told to the people very honestly. I believe that if it were a fair deal, then the content would have been shared with the people. But, in the very first place, my question is: Why have we agreed to sit at the negotiation table with them when we do not want to make a nuclear weapon at all? Why would Iran need a nuclear weapon when the country has 70 million people who are ready to obey their leader if he asks them for anything? We do not doubt our politicians or the nuclear negotiating team at all. But I wish our cabinet members had studied at Iranian universities rather than at foreign universities. That way, they could win our trust even more. Is everybody in Iran like you or are there different people, too? I think that people think like me and they do not like the U.S. One of the positive points about the Islamic Revolution is that the literacy rate, which was only 25 percent before the revolution, has dramatically increased to 99 percent. Now, Iranian people are literate and understanding. They can read and analyze the news, and that is why they believe in their leader. Our people have sacrificed their children for this revolution, and they are either families of martyrs or families of veterans. They do not like the United States. This was why the Islamic Revolution toppled the former regime. What do you love about Friday prayers? Friday prayer sermons are in two parts. The first part is religious and spiritual, and the second part is political. I love the second part. It is full of excitement and makes my blood rush in my veins. The good thing about the second sermon is that the speakers are straightforward and honest. They do not observe special considerations of different people or officials. They just tell the truth. It is why I find it honest and exciting. I have been going to the Friday prayers since the first Friday prayer after the revolution. I remember that my father and I jumped on the back of a double-decker bus because we did not have enough money to pay the bus fare. People used to be poor in those days. Now, fortunately, every family has one or two cars. Follow Thomas Erdbrink on Facebook and Twitter @ThomasErdbrink .

"'Desperate to find a way out': Iran edges towards precipice","Economic grievances, lack of freedoms, global sanctions and climate change putting country under unprecedented pressure  Saeed Kamali Dehghan Iran correspondent  Fri 20 Jul 2018 05.00 BST   Last modified on Mon 23 Jul 2018 09.35 BST   In the words of Mohammad, a graphic designer out of work for four months, life in Iran is “like being a fish in a rapidly shrinking puddle of water, under scorching sun in the middle of desert”. On the surface the 28-year-old’s comments speak to the country’s grave environmental challenges: it is experiencing its worst drought in modern history, with water shortages and recurring electricity cuts that cut the internet, halt lifts and disrupt air conditioning in 40C heat. Authorities in Tehran are even considering to bringing working day forward, from 6am to 2pm, to help workers cope. But Mohammad, who relies on his father’s pension for survival, like a “leech feeding on blood” as he puts it, is not speaking about the environment. Instead he is referring to a wider crisis he says has created a sense of hopelessness permeating Iranian society, which few have seen on such a scale since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. If it’s war, so it be, but quick A combination of factors ranging from economic grievances and a lack of social and political freedoms to international pressure and sanctions has put the country under unprecedented pressure. Many Iranians would now agree with Mohammad that the country faces a pivotal moment. “People are desperate to find a way out,” he says. “If it’s war, so it be, but quick; if it’s reaching an agreement, so it be, but quick; if it’s regime change, so it be, but quick.” Weeks of sporadic protests across the country over water scarcity, unpaid salaries and currency depreciation, combined with mounting pressure from the Trump administration, which wants all countries to stop buying Iranian oil by 4 November, have piled pressure on Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani. He is increasingly being seen as a lame duck as he proves unable to fight off hardliners and pursue his agenda. One pledge he has delivered on – the landmark 2015 nuclear deal – is unravelling after Donald Trump pulled the US out of the framework in May. A piece of tech – an interactive pen – that Mohammad bought last year for 5m rials is now priced at 25m rials (£440), a five-fold increase. Similar price increases have affected other items, particularly those imported and dependent on the price of the dollar. The rial has hit an all-time low and foreign companies are increasingly pulling out of Iran because they fear US actions which will make it difficult for people like Mohammad to find jobs. “All the ‘down to America’, ‘down to Israel’ chants put us in this agony,” he says. “All the people around me are thinking about emigrating. My only way to flee is a student visa, but the costs are high – also you can’t find visa appointment times easily.” Alarm bells have been raised about the country edging towards a political, economic and even environmental precipice, and analysts fear that the warnings are being ignored. Sadegh Zibakalam, a professor of politics at Tehran University, says the situation has become so bad that “people see no light at the end of the tunnel”. “In no period of time before this, we’ve had so much anguish, so much anxiety, so much despair about the future of the country,” he says. “Even this [level of despair] didn’t exist during the Iran-Iraq war years. Despite all the problems during the war, and the rationing, there was hope, because people believed the war would one day finish, but now, the problem is like having an illness that never gets cured. “It might get like Iraq, bartering food for oil. Rouhani is getting closer to hardliners; he is becoming like a football team that has lost the first game 3-0 and now has no hope for the next match. He has become a lame duck.” Zibakalam adds that Iranian society has turned its back against both conservatives and reformists, as people see no prospect of reconciliation with the US. He believes that if, or rather when, the situation gets worse, hardliners will become strengthened, meaning that “the unelected part of the establishment will grab more power”. Ali Ansari, a professor of Iranian history at the University of St Andrews, says the outcome of the current situation “would be … something akin to military government”. “What’s going in Iran is not something for democracy, people are not chanting for democracy, people are chanting for water and bread,” Ansari says. “In 2009 [post-election unrest], people were saying: ‘Where is our vote?’ That’s finished, what’s happening now is much more fundamental talking to the body politic of the country, which is more existential.” The post-revolutionary optimism that helped people go through the Iran-Iraq war, he says, has given way to a state of despair as economic, social and political resources have become depleted. The Iranian currency has been steadily losing its value against the dollar since the 1979 Islamic revolution, when $1 bought 70 rials. This week, $1 was exchanged for up to 75,000 rials in central Tehran. Rouhani raised expectations when he became president in 2013, but could not deliver, says Ansari. “Everyone is focusing on Trump; Trump is his own problem right, let’s not diminish it, but actually the elephant in the room is [Iran’s supreme leader, Ali] Khamenei. We are going all the way downhill, like Venezuela “Khamenei’s principal priority is the Islamic Revolution, and not the Islamic Republic. Khamenei has always been of the view that you have to show strength, but there comes a time when you have to ask what does this mean? [President] Assad showed strength in Syria but what does it mean for him in the long run?” For ordinary Iranians, the sense of despair is palpable. Sam, a 26-year-old university lecturer from Shiraz, describes Iran’s ordeal as “the knife reaching the bone”, a Persian proverb meaning the last straw. Matin, 25, from Isfahan, who earns $115 a month working in a dentist surgery and lives with his parents, is even more downbeat. “We are going all the way downhill, like Venezuela,” he says."
"Iran nuclear talks resume in Geneva","The negotiations enter their first period of extra time with US-Iranian meeting  Mon 15 Dec 2014 12.48 GMT   Last modified on Mon 15 Dec 2014 15.53 GMT   After failing to reach agreement in Vienna by a November 24 deadline after nine months of negotiations, diplomats are sitting down in Geneva today to try to keep the momentum for a nuclear deal going. The deadline was extended until the beginning of July 2015, with the aim of agreeing a framework deal by March 1. The race is on to meet those looming deadlines under the added pressure of a new hawkish, Republican-run US Congress preparing to convene in the first week of January. The mood is downbeat and sober compared to the tantalising hopes awakened in Vienna with the arrival of US secretary of state John Kerry to meet face-to-face with his Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif, accompanied by five other foreign ministers from major powers. Now we know, more or less, the scale and nature of the obstacles that prevented them clinching an agreement. It was expected that the major sticking points would be the scale of Iran’s uranium enrichment capacity and the pace of sanctions relief. It is now clear that the precise red lines were Iran’s requirement that its right to industrial-scale enrichment be recognised in principle, even if it will be subject to limits in the next few years, and Tehran’s insistence that it would not take irreversible (or very difficult to reverse) steps, like dismantling plant and infrastructure without an equivalent lifting (rather than the suspension) of sanctions. The US position was that the overall sanctions architecture should be kept in place, and for Iranian enrichment capacity to be kept strictly in line with the country’s needs for power generation. This remains a wide gap to bridge. The talks have begun on a low key, without Kerry or Zarif or any of the other foreign ministers for the time being. Wendy Sherman, the acting deputy secretary of state, is leading the US team, while the Iranians are led by two deputy foreign ministers, Abbas Araghchi and Majid Takht Ravanchi. But more important than the people is the process. This time the talks have quickly entered their most effective forum, bilateral encounters between the Americans and the Iranians, without the need for the presence of Cathy Ashton, the former EU foreign policy chief or her deputy to ensure the other five countries in the talks (the UK, France, Germany, Russia and China) to be kept constantly in the loop. As the International Crisis Group points out in its comprehensive assessment of the talks, Iran Nuclear Talks: The Fog Recedes , this was an essential procedural short-cut that was agreed at the end of the Vienna talks. The ICG report said an second procedural tweak was made to reverse “an ill-advised decision to jointly tackle political and technical questions”. A lot of the technical data, and various versions of a final deal have already been drafted. What remains to be done is the hammering out of a political compromise. That is what is on the table in Geneva."
"Kerry Is Pushing for Agreement in Iran Nuclear Talks","Advertisement Supported by By  Michael R. Gordon WASHINGTON — They have spent long hours alone together. They exchange private emails. Their walk along the Rhone River in Geneva in January so unnerved hard-line lawmakers in Tehran that they signed a petition fretting about the duo’s unseemly “intimacy.” On Sunday, Secretary of State John Kerry flew to Switzerland to meet again with Mohammad Javad Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister who earned a Ph.D in international law and policy from the University of Denver, to try to negotiate the very accord that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel arrived in Washington that same day to denounce. As the deadline approaches for what could be one of the most important and divisive international agreements in decades, Mr. Kerry has become a driving force behind the complicated, seven-nation talks to limit Iran’s nuclear program. But with so much at stake, Mr. Kerry’s relentless negotiating style and determination to engage with Mr. Zarif have become part of the debate. To proponents of the emerging accord, Mr. Kerry’s determination has made all the difference. “He has made a huge investment of his time and energy in the talks, and his personal, hands-on involvement in recent months has been crucial to building momentum toward a deal,” said Robert Einhorn, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who served on the American negotiating team on the Iran talks from 2009 to 2013. To critics, Mr. Kerry’s eagerness is an open invitation for the Iranians to press for concessions as the talks enter the final stage. Ray Takeyh, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and a former State Department expert on Iran, said that given Mr. Kerry’s “inordinate attention to this issue, there is an impression that he wants this agreement more so than the Iranians.” When Mr. Kerry recently warned that the United States was prepared to walk away from the talks if the Iranians refused to compromise, “that was not a claim that was taken with much seriousness in Tehran,” Mr. Takeyh said. What the United States and Iran want out of discussions over Iran’s nuclear development. Mr. Kerry’s meeting with the Iranians on Monday in the Swiss lakeside town of Montreux will be his eighth negotiating session with them this year. It follows meetings in Geneva, Munich, Paris and Davos, Switzerland, which also had one-on-one sessions in which Mr. Kerry and Mr. Zarif, who call each other John and Javad, left their negotiating teams behind to convene alone. An agreement on Iran’s nuclear program would be a momentous event in American-Iranian relations, and one that White House officials insist is the best hope for constraining Tehran’s nuclear ambitions and easing decades of animosity between Iran and the United States. But critics fear a deal will merely defer the day when Iran becomes a nuclear weapons state, while prompting Arab nations to consider developing their own nuclear deterrent. An accord could also be a major accomplishment for Mr. Kerry, 71, who has logged more than 309 travel days in the past two years, but whose major achievement to date is an agreement that required President Bashar al-Assad of Syria to give up his chemical arms — and left him ensconced in Damascus while the casualty toll from the conflict has continued to soar. Mr. Kerry’s intensive pursuit of a Middle East peace agreement ended in bitter recriminations between Israeli and Palestinian leaders, and he has little to show for his push to end the civil war in Syria. In Ukraine, it is the Germans and French who have the lead: No American officials were present when a shaky cease-fire was reached in talks with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia last month, and which Russia-backed separatists ignored by taking the town of Debaltseve. Mr. Kerry’s relationship with Mr. Zarif is not unique. Mr. Kerry has invested heavily in his relationships with other foreign figures, such as Mr. Netanyahu and Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, even when the payoff has not always been obvious. But Mr. Kerry clearly sees Mr. Zarif as a promising interlocutor at a time when conditions for a deal are better than they have been in years. Plummeting oil prices, economic sanctions and the Obama administration’s willingness to allow Iran to retain a limited capability to enrich uranium have provided Tehran with an incentive to negotiate. Mr. Kerry’s diplomatic efforts with Mr. Zarif began at the United Nations in September 2013, when an introductory meeting scheduled for five minutes lasted for half an hour and ended with the diplomats exchanging email addresses and phone numbers. The relationship, however, has not always been harmonious. There were angry voices in a meeting in Muscat, Oman, last November, when the American side became frustrated by Mr. Zarif’s reluctance — or inability, given his tight negotiating instructions — to make important concessions. When the two sides were unable to surmount their differences later that month in Vienna, Mr. Kerry proclaimed that they had been brainstorming about new ideas and would seek a framework agreement by the end of March. Whether Iran is racing toward nuclear weapon capabilities is one of the most contentious foreign-policy issues challenging the West. In recent months, the pace, intensity and stakes of the talks have increased. After Mr. Zarif was criticized by the Iranian lawmakers for his stroll with Mr. Kerry in Geneva, he appeared to be taking no chances when the two sides reconvened in Munich in February and photographers were not permitted to record the traditional handshake and greetings at the start of the session. In an apparent effort to demonstrate his toughness to his Iranian critics, Mr. Zarif also told Iran’s state-controlled media that he had been instructed by Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to stop shouting at Mr. Kerry. At the last round of talks , however, the two sides appeared to get down to business. As that negotiating session approached, the Iranians informed the United States that Mr. Zarif would be accompanied in Geneva by Ali Akbar Salehi, the director of Iran’s Atomic Energy Organization, who also served as foreign minister under Iran’s former president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. That prompted the United States to include Ernest J. Moniz, the secretary of energy, in the talks. Mr. Salehi and Mr. Moniz are also expected to be at the Montreux negotiations with the two foreign ministers. In the meantime, Mr. Kerry’s laserlike focus on getting an accord has unnerved Israel and prompted concerns in Saudi Arabia and other Arab foes of Tehran, anxieties Mr. Kerry is trying to quell even before an agreement has been forged. Mr. Kerry talked to Mr. Netanyahu by phone on Saturday, and discussed the Iran negotiations, the prime minister’s visit to Washington and the United States’ concern about the financial plight of the Palestinian Authority, even after criticizing him in public. (Mr. Kerry recently told Congress that the Israeli prime minister’s support for the George W. Bush administration’s effort to topple Saddam Hussein showed his judgment could not always been trusted. Mr. Kerry did not mention that he himself voted for a 2002 Senate resolution authorizing military action against Iraq if diplomatic efforts to eliminate its suspected weapons of mass destruction failed.) Mr. Kerry has also made plans to try to ease Arab anxieties about the potential accord with Iran. After leaving Montreux, Mr. Kerry plans to head to Riyadh to meet on Thursday with the new Saudi king, Salman. His next step will be London, where he will meet with foreign ministers from Arab nations in the Persian Gulf. A European diplomat whose country is participating in the negotiations with Iran questioned last week whether Mr. Kerry was too involved. “You want to bring in the secretary of state at the end, to resolve the last differences, as a closer,” said the official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the talks. “He should not be involved in the day-to-day technical negotiations.” The Obama administration has sent Mr. Moniz and a team of experts to work on the technical issues with their Iranian counterparts in Montreux. But the next few weeks are expected to see a series of marathon meetings between the two foreign ministers, and with a deadline fast approaching, nobody is expecting Mr. Kerry to hold back now.

"Is Trump about to repeat George W Bush's worst mistake?","In 2002, Bush used his UN speech to argue for action against Iraq. Let’s hope Trump’s first UN speech isn’t the opening salvo in a preventable war with Iran  Wed 20 Sep 2017 11.00 BST   Last modified on Thu 5 Jul 2018 21.48 BST   I n 2003, the United States initiated perhaps the greatest strategic disaster in US history by diverting attention from a necessary war in Afghanistan to an unnecessary war in Iraq. The Iraq war resulted in hundreds of thousands dead and wounded, untold economic catastrophe, states in the Middle East in complete ruin, and the rise of Isis – all while the effort to go after terrorists in Afghanistan languished. President Donald Trump’s first speech before the United Nations general assembly this week made clear that Trump wants to take America down a similar path by diverting much-needed attention from North Korea to starting an unnecessary conflict with Iran. If the United States and the world cannot convince Trump to support the Iran nuclear deal and instead focus on real problems, America may once again plunge into a violent disaster in the Middle East, and in the process damage efforts to deal with a country that already has nuclear weapons. The threat from North Korea is real, and Trump used his speech to outline the need for an international pressure campaign against Kim Jong-un. There is little disagreement on the need for a tough stance against North Korea, as evidenced by the UN security council’s recent unanimous vote to impose new sanctions. But Trump is having a difficult time implementing a coherent strategy on North Korea. He has picked a fight with America’s South Korean ally, whose support is essential. He frequently hurls hyperbolic rhetoric, raising the chances of miscalculation that could lead to conflict. And he talks as though war is inevitable, a theme he reiterated before the world’s leaders when he said, “Rocket Man [Kim Jong-un] is on a suicide mission for himself and his regime.” Significant challenges remain in dealing with North Korea, even if Trump can get his own act together. China is unwilling to apply maximum pressure on North Korea for fear Pyongyang will collapse. Enforcing sanctions elsewhere is often like putting fingers in a dam full of leaks. It’s unclear what kind of a diplomatic deal the United States wants with North Korea. And little seems capable of convincing Kim Jong-un that he will be safe without nuclear weapons. With obstacles this great, Trump should be providing leadership in pursuing an effective international strategy to deter North Korea, reassure US allies, add sanctions pressure, and engage in real diplomacy. Instead, Trump is looking to rip up the deal that is currently preventing Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. If he succeeds in doing so, he will help turn Iran into the next North Korea and ratchet up the chances of conflict. The deal prevents Iran from getting a nuclear weapon for years. UN inspectors have verified that Iran is complying with the terms of the deal. Even Trump’s administration has certified twice that Iran is living up to its end of the bargain. Moreover, the world backs the deal, with Russia, China and Europe all helping to enforce it. If an Iran-style nuclear deal had been on the table at any point with North Korea, the United States would have jumped at the opportunity (and in fact came very close to making the Agreed Framework deal with North Korea work in the 1990s). Tearing up the Iran deal would be the strategic equivalent of shooting oneself in the foot. But that’s exactly what Trump seems to want. In his UN speech , Trump placed the Iran nuclear deal in his sights: “The Iran deal was one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into. Frankly, that deal is an embarrassment to the United States, and I don’t think you’ve heard the last of it. Believe me.” Recent  reports back up this message that Trump intends to rip up the deal, and the US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, almost said as much in a recent speech on Iran. It’s hard to overstate the potential disaster of destroying the Iran deal. Iran would be incentivized to race to get a nuclear weapon. The partners that helped make the Iran deal happen – Europe, China, Russia – would leave the US behind and continue doing business with Iran, making impossible any renewal of international pressure. And if Iran actually acquired a nuclear weapon, it could embolden Iran to escalate its regional provocations. All of this would result in more confrontation with the United States, and greater chances of war. In fact, withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal would undermine Trump’s efforts to convince the world that he is looking for a diplomatic solution with North Korea: if Trump is willing to rip up a deal preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, why should anyone believe he’s willing to deal with North Korea? And why would North Korea deal with Trump if he doesn’t live up to US commitments? In 2002, less than a year after invading Afghanistan, President George W Bush used his speech before the UN general assembly to make the case to the world for action against Iraq. Let’s hope, when history looks back on Trump’s first UN speech, it’s not viewed as the opening salvo in a completely preventable war with Iran."
"The Aspiring Novelist Who Became Obama’s Foreign-Policy Guru","Feature How Ben Rhodes rewrote the rules of diplomacy for the digital age. Supported by By  David Samuels P icture him as a young man, standing on the waterfront in North Williamsburg, at a polling site, on Sept. 11, 2001, which was Election Day in New York City. He saw the planes hit the towers, an unforgettable moment of sheer disbelief followed by panic and shock and lasting horror, a scene that eerily reminded him, in the aftermath, of the cover of the Don DeLillo novel “Underworld.” Everything changed that day. But the way it changed Ben Rhodes’s life is still unique, and perhaps not strictly believable, even as fiction. He was in the second year of the M.F.A. program at N.Y.U., writing short stories about losers in garden apartments and imagining that soon he would be published in literary magazines, acquire an agent and produce a novel by the time he turned 26. He saw the first tower go down, and after that he walked around for a while, until he ran into someone he knew, and they went back to her shared Williamsburg apartment and tried to find a television that worked, and when he came back outside, everyone was taking pictures of the towers in flames. He saw an Arab guy sobbing on the subway. “That image has always stayed with me,” he says. “Because I think he knew more than we did about what was going to happen.” Writing Frederick Barthelme knockoffs suddenly seemed like a waste of time. “I immediately developed this idea that, you know, maybe I want to try to write about international affairs,” he explained. “In retrospect, I had no idea what that meant.” His mother’s closest friend growing up ran the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, which then published Foreign Policy. He sent her a letter and included what would wind up being his only piece of published fiction, a short story that appeared in The Beloit Fiction Journal. It was titled “The Goldfish Smiles, You Smile Back.” The story still haunts him, he says, because “it foreshadowed my entire life.” It’s the day of President Obama’s final State of the Union address, Jan. 12, and the news inside the White House is not good. Luckily, the reporters on the couch in the West Wing waiting room don’t know it yet. The cream of the crop are here this early p.m. for a private, off-the-record lunch with the president, who will preview his annual remarks to Congress over a meal that is reported to be among the best in the White House chef’s repertoire. “Blitzer!” a man calls out. A small figure in a long navy cashmere overcoat turns around, in mock surprise. “You don’t write, you don’t call,” Wolf Blitzer, the CNN anchorman, parries. “Well, you can call,” shoots back his former colleague Roland Martin. Their repartee thus concluded, they move on to the mutually fascinating subject of Washington traffic jams. “I used to have a 9:30 hit on CNN,” Martin reminisces. “The office was 8.2 miles from my home. It took me 45 minutes.” The CBS News anchor Scott Pelley tells a story about how members of the press destroyed the lawn during the Monica Lewinsky scandal and were told that they would be allowed back once the grass was replanted. The National Park Service replanted the grass outside the White House, but the journalists weren’t allowed back on the lawn. Unnoticed by the reporters, Ben Rhodes walks through the room, a half-beat behind a woman in leopard-print heels. He is holding a phone to his ear, repeating his mantra: “I’m not important. You’re important.” The Boy Wonder of the Obama White House is now 38. He heads downstairs to his windowless basement office, which is divided into two parts. In the front office, his assistant, Rumana Ahmed, and his deputy, Ned Price, are squeezed behind desks, which face a large television screen, from which CNN blares nonstop. Large pictures of Obama adorn the walls. Here is the president adjusting Rhodes’s tie; presenting his darling baby daughter, Ella, with a flower; and smiling wide while playing with Ella on a giant rug that says “E Pluribus Unum.” For much of the past five weeks, Rhodes has been channeling the president’s consciousness into what was imagined as an optimistic, forward-looking final State of the Union. Now, from the flat screens, a challenge to that narrative arises: Iran has seized two small boats containing 10 American sailors. Rhodes found out about the Iranian action earlier that morning but was trying to keep it out of the news until after the president’s speech. “They can’t keep a secret for two hours,” Rhodes says, with a tone of mild exasperation at the break in message discipline. As the deputy national security adviser for strategic communications, Rhodes writes the president’s speeches, plans his trips abroad and runs communications strategy across the White House, tasks that, taken individually, give little sense of the importance of his role. He is, according to the consensus of the two dozen current and former White House insiders I talked to, the single most influential voice shaping American foreign policy aside from Potus himself. The president and Rhodes communicate “regularly, several times a day,” according to Denis McDonough, Obama’s chief of staff, who is known for captaining a tight ship. “I see it throughout the day in person,” he says, adding that he is sure that in addition to the two to three hours that Rhodes might spend with Obama daily, the two men communicate remotely throughout the day via email and phone calls. Rhodes strategized and ran the successful Iran-deal messaging campaign, helped negotiate the opening of American relations with Cuba after a hiatus of more than 50 years and has been a co-writer of all of Obama’s major foreign-policy speeches. “Every day he does 12 jobs, and he does them better than the other people who have those jobs,” Terry Szuplat, the longest-tenured member of the National Security Council speechwriting corps, told me. On the largest and smallest questions alike, the voice in which America speaks to the world is that of Ben Rhodes. Like Obama, Rhodes is a storyteller who uses a writer’s tools to advance an agenda that is packaged as politics but is often quite personal. He is adept at constructing overarching plotlines with heroes and villains, their conflicts and motivations supported by flurries of carefully chosen adjectives, quotations and leaks from named and unnamed senior officials. He is the master shaper and retailer of Obama’s foreign-policy narratives, at a time when the killer wave of social media has washed away the sand castles of the traditional press. His ability to navigate and shape this new environment makes him a more effective and powerful extension of the president’s will than any number of policy advisers or diplomats or spies. His lack of conventional real-world experience of the kind that normally precedes responsibility for the fate of nations — like military or diplomatic service, or even a master’s degree in international relations, rather than creative writing — is still startling. Part of what accounts for Rhodes’s influence is his “mind meld” with the president. Nearly everyone I spoke to about Rhodes used the phrase “mind meld” verbatim, some with casual assurance and others in the hushed tones that are usually reserved for special insights. He doesn’t think for the president, but he knows what the president is thinking, which is a source of tremendous power. One day, when Rhodes and I were sitting in his boiler-room office, he confessed, with a touch of bafflement, “I don’t know anymore where I begin and Obama ends.” Standing in his front office before the State of the Union, Rhodes quickly does the political math on the breaking Iran story. “Now they’ll show scary pictures of people praying to the supreme leader,” he predicts, looking at the screen. Three beats more, and his brain has spun a story line to stanch the bleeding. He turns to Price. “We’re resolving this, because we have relationships,” he says. Price turns to his computer and begins tapping away at the administration’s well-cultivated network of officials, talking heads, columnists and newspaper reporters, web jockeys and outside advocates who can tweet at critics and tweak their stories backed up by quotations from “senior White House officials” and “spokespeople.” I watch the message bounce from Rhodes’s brain to Price’s keyboard to the three big briefing podiums — the White House, the State Department and the Pentagon — and across the Twitterverse, where it springs to life in dozens of insta-stories, which over the next five hours don formal dress for mainstream outlets. It’s a tutorial in the making of a digital news microclimate — a storm that is easy to mistake these days for a fact of nature, but whose author is sitting next to me right now. Rhodes logs into his computer. “It’s the middle of the [expletive] night in Iran,” he grumbles. Price looks up from his keyboard to provide a messaging update: “Considering that they have 10 of our guys in custody, we’re doing O.K.” With three hours to go until the president’s address to Congress, Rhodes grabs a big Gatorade and starts combing through the text of the State of the Union address. I peek over his shoulder, to get a sense of the meta-narrative that will shape dozens of thumb-suckers in the days and weeks to follow. One sentence reads: “But as we focus on destroying ISIL, over-the-top claims that this is World War III just play into their hands.” He retypes a word, then changes it back, before continuing with his edit. “Masses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks, twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages — they pose an enormous danger to civilians; they have to be stopped. But they do not threaten our national existence.” Watching Rhodes work, I remember that he is still, chiefly, a writer, who is using a new set of tools — along with the traditional arts of narrative and spin — to create stories of great consequence on the biggest page imaginable. The narratives he frames, the voices of senior officials, the columnists and reporters whose work he skillfully shapes and ventriloquizes, and even the president’s own speeches and talking points, are the only dots of color in a much larger vision about who Americans are and where we are going that Rhodes and the president have been formulating together over the past seven years. When I asked Jon Favreau, Obama’s lead speechwriter in the 2008 campaign, and a close friend of Rhodes’s, whether he or Rhodes or the president had ever thought of their individual speeches and bits of policy making as part of some larger restructuring of the American narrative, he replied, “We saw that as our entire job.” Having recently spent time working in Hollywood, I realize during our conversations that the role Rhodes plays in the White House bears less resemblance to any specific character on Beltway-insider TV shows like “The West Wing” or “House of Cards” than it does to the people who create those shows. And like most TV writers, Rhodes clearly prefers to imagine himself in the company of novelists. “What novel is this that you are living in now and will exit from in eight months and be like, ‘Oh, my God’?” I ask him. “Who would be the author of this novel?” he asks. “The one you are a character in now?” “Don DeLillo, I think,” Rhodes answers. “I don’t know how you feel about Don DeLillo.” “I love Don DeLillo,” I answer. “Yeah,” Rhodes answers. “That’s the only person I can think of who has confronted these questions of, you know, the individual who finds himself negotiating both vast currents of history and a very specific kind of power dynamics. That’s his milieu. And that’s what it’s like to work in the U.S. foreign-policy apparatus in 2016.” It has been rare to find Ben Rhodes’s name in news stories about the large events of the past seven years, unless you are looking for the quotation from an unnamed senior official in Paragraph 9. He is invisible because he is not an egotist, and because he is devoted to the president. But once you are attuned to the distinctive qualities of Rhodes’s voice — which is often laced with aggressive contempt for anyone or anything that stands in the president’s way — you can hear him everywhere. Rhodes’s mother and father are not interested in talking about Rhodes. Neither is his older brother, David, who is president of CBS News, an organization that recently revived the effort to declassify the contents of the redacted 28 pages of the Sept. 11 report on the eve of Obama’s visit to Saudi Arabia, on which Rhodes, as usual, accompanied the president. The brothers are close, but they often go months without seeing each other. “He was like the kid who carried the briefcase to school,” Ben says of his brother, who worked at Fox News and Bloomberg before moving to CBS. “I actually didn’t do that great in high school because I was drinking and smoking pot and hanging out in Central Park.” Rhodes’s impassioned yet depressive vibe, which I feel in his stray remarks and in the strangeness of his decision to allow me to roam around the White House, stems in part from feeling overloaded; he wishes he had more time to think and write. His mother is Jewish from the Upper East Side, and worships John Updike, and reads The New Yorker. His father is a Texan lawyer who took his sons to St. Thomas Episcopal Church once a month, where Rhodes felt like the Jewish kid in church, the same way he felt like a “Jewish Christian” at Passover Seders. His New York City prep-school-kid combination of vulnerability, brattiness and passionate hatred for phonies suggests an only slightly updated version of what Holden Caulfield might have been like if he grew up to work in the West Wing. Rhodes’s windowless back office, which doesn’t have a TV screen, is an oasis of late-night calm in a building devoted to the performance of power. The walls are painted a soft creamy color, which gives it the feel of an upscale hotel room with the drapes closed. He arrives here every morning between 8 and 9 from a modest two-bedroom apartment in a grad-student-type building in an unpretentious Washington neighborhood around the corner from his favorite post-collegiate bar. Before coming to work, he walks his 1-year-old daughter to day care. Then he drives to work in his Beamer, which appears to be the one grown-up luxury he and his wife, Ann Norris, who works in the State Department and longs to return to her childhood home of California, can afford. When his wife takes the car, he rides the bus, which offers him a touch of the anonymity he craves. His days at the White House start with the president’s daily briefing, which usually includes the vice president, National Security Adviser Susan Rice, Deputy National Security Adviser Avril Haines and Homeland Security Adviser Lisa Monaco. The books on his shelves are a mix of DeLillo novels, history books, recondite tomes on Cuba and Burma and adventure-wonk stuff like Mark Mazzetti’s “The Way of the Knife.” C. S. Lewis makes an appearance here, alongside a volume of Lincoln speeches (Obama tells all his speechwriters to read Lincoln) and George Orwell’s “All Art Is Propaganda.” I have seen the same books on the shelves of plenty of Brooklyn apartments. Yet some large part of the recent history of America and its role in the world turns on the fact that the entirely familiar person sitting at the desk in front of me, who seems not unlike other weed-smokers I know who write Frederick Barthelme-type short stories, has achieved a “mind meld” with President Obama and used his skills to help execute a radical shift in American foreign policy. So I wonder: How did he get from there to here? The story that Rhodes published in The Beloit Fiction Journal is a good place to start. The editor at Foreign Policy who read “Goldfish,” which Rhodes attached with his query letter, said that the young M.F.A. would be bored with fact-checking. Instead, he suggested that he apply for a job with Lee Hamilton, the onetime congressman from Indiana, who was looking for a speechwriter. “I was surprised,” Hamilton remembered. “What the hell does a guy who wanted to write fiction come to me for?” But he had always found writers useful, and Rhodes’s writing sample was the best in the pile. So he hired him on at the Wilson Center, a nonpartisan think tank. Though Rhodes never said a word in meetings, Hamilton says, he had a keen understanding of what was going on and a talent for putting the positions of distinguished participants down on paper. “I immediately understood that it’s a very important quality for a staffer,” Hamilton explained, “that he could come into a meeting and decide what was decided.” I suggested that the phrase “decide what was decided” is suggestive of the enormous power that might accrue to someone with Rhodes’s gifts. Hamilton nodded. “Absolutely,” he said. Rhodes served as Hamilton’s staff member on the 9/11 Commission, where he met Denis McDonough, another Hamilton protégé, who had gone on to work for Tom Daschle in the Senate. Rhodes then became the chief note-taker for the Iraq Study Group, the bipartisan commission that excoriated George Bush’s war in Iraq. He accompanied Hamilton and his Republican counterpart on the group, former secretary of state and Bush family intimate James Baker, to their meetings with Colin Powell, Condoleezza Rice, Stephen Hadley, David Petraeus and many others (Vice President Dick Cheney met with the group but didn’t say a word). According to both Hamilton and Edward Djerejian, Baker’s second on the I.S.G., Rhodes’s opinions were helpful in shaping the group’s conclusions — a scathing indictment of the policy makers responsible for invading Iraq. For Rhodes, who wrote much of the I.S.G. report, the Iraq war was proof, in black and white, not of the complexity of international affairs or the many perils attendant on political decision-making but of the fact that the decision-makers were morons. One result of this experience was that when Rhodes joined the Obama campaign in 2007, he arguably knew more about the Iraq war than the candidate himself, or any of his advisers. He had also developed a healthy contempt for the American foreign-policy establishment, including editors and reporters at The New York Times, The Washington Post, The New Yorker and elsewhere, who at first applauded the Iraq war and then sought to pin all the blame on Bush and his merry band of neocons when it quickly turned sour. If anything, that anger has grown fiercer during Rhodes’s time in the White House. He referred to the American foreign-policy establishment as the Blob. According to Rhodes, the Blob includes Hillary Clinton, Robert Gates and other Iraq-war promoters from both parties who now whine incessantly about the collapse of the American security order in Europe and the Middle East. Jon Favreau, then the campaign’s lead speechwriter, felt as if he could use a foreign-affairs expert who could write. “Foreign-policy advisers kept changing all the language that made Obama sound like he wasn’t part of the Democratic foreign-policy establishment,” he remembers. “The idea of someone with a masters in fiction who had also co-authored the Iraq Study Group and 9/11 Commission reports seemed perfect for a candidate who put so much emphasis on storytelling.” The two young speechwriters quickly found themselves to be in sync. “He truly gives zero [expletive] about what most people in Washington think,” Favreau says admiringly of Rhodes. “I think he’s always seen his time there as temporary and won’t care if he’s never again invited to a cocktail party, or asked to appear on ‘Morning Joe,’ or inducted into the Council on Foreign Relations hall of fame or whatever the hell they do there.” “He was easily underestimatable,” Samantha Power recalls, of Rhodes’s arrival on the Obama campaign in 2007. Herself a writer, whose history of America’s responses to genocide, “A Problem From Hell,” won the Pulitzer Prize, Power went to work in Obama’s Senate office in 2005. Power is now the American ambassador to the United Nations. Her attire suggests a disingenuous ambivalence about her role in government that appears to be common among her cohort in the Obama administration, with a cardigan made of thick, expensive-looking cashmere worn over a simple frock, along with silver spray-painted rock ’n’ roll sneakers. See, I’m sympatico, the sneakers proclaim. Early on, what struck her about Rhodes was how strategic he was. “He was leading quietly, initially, and mainly just through track changes, like what to accept and reject,” she says. When I ask her where Rhodes’s control over drafts of the candidate’s speeches came from, she immediately answers, “Obama,” but then qualifies her answer. “But it was Hobbesian,” she adds. “He had the pen. And he understood intuitively that having the pen gave him that control.” His judgment was superior to that of his rivals, and he refused to ever back down. “He was just defiant,” she recalls. “He was like: ‘No, I’m not. That’s bad. Obama wouldn’t want that.’ ” Obama relies on Rhodes for “an unvarnished take,” in part, she says, because “Ben just has no poker face,” and so it’s easy to see when he is feeling uncomfortable. “The president will be like, ‘Ben, something on your mind?’ And then Ben will have this incredibly precise lay-down of why the previous half-hour has been an utter waste of time, because there’s a structural flaw to the entire direction of the conversation.” The literary character that Rhodes most closely resembles, Power volunteers, is Holden Caulfield. “He hates the idea of being phony, and he’s impetuous, and he has very strong views.” On his first day in the West Wing, Rhodes remembers thinking how remarkably small the space was, and noticing that the same few dozen people he worked with at campaign headquarters in Chicago were now wearing suits instead of jeans. The enormousness of the endeavor sank in on that first day, and he realized that for all the prep work, there was no manual for how to be on the staff of the person who is running the country, particularly at a time when the global economy was in free fall and 180,000 Americans were fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. He became aware of two things at once: the weight of the issues that the president was confronted with, and the intense global interest in even the most mundane presidential communications. The job he was hired to do, namely to help the president of the United States communicate with the public, was changing in equally significant ways, thanks to the impact of digital technologies that people in Washington were just beginning to wrap their minds around. It is hard for many to absorb the true magnitude of the change in the news business — 40 percent of newspaper-industry professionals have lost their jobs over the past decade — in part because readers can absorb all the news they want from social-media platforms like Facebook, which are valued in the tens and hundreds of billions of dollars and pay nothing for the “content” they provide to their readers. You have to have skin in the game — to be in the news business, or depend in a life-or-death way on its products — to understand the radical and qualitative ways in which words that appear in familiar typefaces have changed. Rhodes singled out a key example to me one day, laced with the brutal contempt that is a hallmark of his private utterances. “All these newspapers used to have foreign bureaus,” he said. “Now they don’t. They call us to explain to them what’s happening in Moscow and Cairo. Most of the outlets are reporting on world events from Washington. The average reporter we talk to is 27 years old, and their only reporting experience consists of being around political campaigns. That’s a sea change. They literally know nothing.” In this environment, Rhodes has become adept at ventriloquizing many people at once. Ned Price, Rhodes’s assistant, gave me a primer on how it’s done. The easiest way for the White House to shape the news, he explained, is from the briefing podiums, each of which has its own dedicated press corps. “But then there are sort of these force multipliers,” he said, adding, “We have our compadres, I will reach out to a couple people, and you know I wouldn’t want to name them — ” “I can name them,” I said, ticking off a few names of prominent Washington reporters and columnists who often tweet in sync with White House messaging. Price laughed. “I’ll say, ‘Hey, look, some people are spinning this narrative that this is a sign of American weakness,’ ” he continued, “but — ” “In fact it’s a sign of strength!” I said, chuckling. “And I’ll give them some color,” Price continued, “and the next thing I know, lots of these guys are in the dot-com publishing space, and have huge Twitter followings, and they’ll be putting this message out on their own.” This is something different from old-fashioned spin, which tended to be an art best practiced in person. In a world where experienced reporters competed for scoops and where carrying water for the White House was a cause for shame, no matter which party was in power, it was much harder to sustain a “narrative” over any serious period of time. Now the most effectively weaponized 140-character idea or quote will almost always carry the day, and it is very difficult for even good reporters to necessarily know where the spin is coming from or why. When I later visited Obama’s former campaign mastermind David Axelrod in Chicago, I brought up the soft Orwellian vibe of an information space where old media structures and hierarchies have been erased by Silicon Valley billionaires who convinced the suckers that information was “free” and everyone with access to Google was now a reporter. Axelrod, a former newspaperman, sighed. “It’s not as easy as standing in front of a press conference and speaking to 70 million people like past presidents have been able to do,” he said. The bully pulpit by and large doesn’t exist anymore, he explained. “So more and more, over the last couple of years, there’s been an investment in alternative means of communication: using digital more effectively, going to nontraditional sources, understanding where on each issue your constituencies are going to be found,” he said. “I think they’ve approached these major foreign-policy challenges as campaign challenges, and they’ve run campaigns, and those campaigns have been very sophisticated.” Rhodes’s innovative campaign to sell the Iran deal is likely to be a model for how future administrations explain foreign policy to Congress and the public. The way in which most Americans have heard the story of the Iran deal presented — that the Obama administration began seriously engaging with Iranian officials in 2013 in order to take advantage of a new political reality in Iran, which came about because of elections that brought moderates to power in that country — was largely manufactured for the purpose for selling the deal. Even where the particulars of that story are true, the implications that readers and viewers are encouraged to take away from those particulars are often misleading or false. Obama’s closest advisers always understood him to be eager to do a deal with Iran as far back as 2012, and even since the beginning of his presidency. “It’s the center of the arc,” Rhodes explained to me two days after the deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, was implemented. He then checked off the ways in which the administration’s foreign-policy aims and priorities converged on Iran. “We don’t have to kind of be in cycles of conflict if we can find other ways to resolve these issues,” he said. “We can do things that challenge the conventional thinking that, you know, ‘AIPAC doesn’t like this,’ or ‘the Israeli government doesn’t like this,’ or ‘the gulf countries don’t like it.’ It’s the possibility of improved relations with adversaries. It’s nonproliferation. So all these threads that the president’s been spinning — and I mean that not in the press sense — for almost a decade, they kind of all converged around Iran.” In the narrative that Rhodes shaped, the “story” of the Iran deal began in 2013, when a “moderate” faction inside the Iranian regime led by Hassan Rouhani beat regime “hard-liners” in an election and then began to pursue a policy of “openness,” which included a newfound willingness to negotiate the dismantling of its illicit nuclear-weapons program. The president set out the timeline himself in his speech announcing the nuclear deal on July 14, 2015: “Today, after two years of negotiations, the United States, together with our international partners, has achieved something that decades of animosity has not.” While the president’s statement was technically accurate — there had in fact been two years of formal negotiations leading up to the signing of the J.C.P.O.A. — it was also actively misleading, because the most meaningful part of the negotiations with Iran had begun in mid-2012, many months before Rouhani and the “moderate” camp were chosen in an election among candidates handpicked by Iran’s supreme leader, the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The idea that there was a new reality in Iran was politically useful to the Obama administration. By obtaining broad public currency for the thought that there was a significant split in the regime, and that the administration was reaching out to moderate-minded Iranians who wanted peaceful relations with their neighbors and with America, Obama was able to evade what might have otherwise been a divisive but clarifying debate over the actual policy choices that his administration was making. By eliminating the fuss about Iran’s nuclear program, the administration hoped to eliminate a source of structural tension between the two countries, which would create the space for America to disentangle itself from its established system of alliances with countries like Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Israel and Turkey. With one bold move, the administration would effectively begin the process of a large-scale disengagement from the Middle East. The nerve center for the selling of the Iran deal to Congress, which took place in a concentrated three-month period between July and September of last year, was located inside the White House, and is referred to by its former denizens as “the war room.” Chad Kreikemeier, a Nebraskan who had worked in the White House Office of Legislative Affairs, helped run the team, which included three to six people from each of several agencies, he says, which were the State Department, Treasury, the American delegation to the United Nations (i.e., Samantha Power), “at times D.O.D.” (the Department of Defense) and also the Department of Energy and the National Security Council. Rhodes “was kind of like the quarterback,” running the daily video conferences and coming up with lines of attack and parry. “He was extremely good about immediately getting to a phrase or a way of getting the message out that just made more sense,” Kreikemeier remembers. Framing the deal as a choice between peace and war was Rhodes’s go-to move — and proved to be a winning argument. The person whom Kreikemeier credits with running the digital side of the campaign was Tanya Somanader, 31, the director of digital response for the White House Office of Digital Strategy, who became known in the war room and on Twitter as @TheIranDeal. Early on, Rhodes asked her to create a rapid-response account that fact-checked everything related to the Iran deal. “So, we developed a plan that was like: The Iran deal is literally going to be the tip of everything that we stand up online,” Somanader says. “And we’re going to map it onto what we know about the different audiences we’re dealing with: the public, pundits, experts, the right wing, Congress.” By applying 21st-century data and networking tools to the white-glove world of foreign affairs, the White House was able to track what United States senators and the people who worked for them, and influenced them, were seeing online — and make sure that no potential negative comment passed without a tweet. As she explained how the process worked, I was struck by how naïve the assumption of a “state of nature” must seem in an information environment that is mediated less and less by experienced editors and reporters with any real prior knowledge of the subjects they write about. “People construct their own sense of source and credibility now,” she said. “They elect who they’re going to believe.” For those in need of more traditional-seeming forms of validation, handpicked Beltway insiders like Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic and Laura Rozen of Al-Monitor helped retail the administration’s narrative. “Laura Rozen was my RSS feed,” Somanader offered. “She would just find everything and retweet it.” Rhodes’s messaging campaign was so effective not simply because it was a perfectly planned and executed example of digital strategy, but also because he was personally involved in guiding the deal itself. In July 2012, Jake Sullivan, a close aide to Hillary Clinton, traveled to Muscat, Oman, for the first meeting with the Iranians, taking a message from the White House. “It was, ‘We’re prepared to open a direct channel to resolve the nuclear agreement if you are prepared to do the same thing and authorize it at the highest levels and engage in a serious discussion on these issues,’ ” Sullivan remembers. “Once that was agreed to, it was quickly decided that we resolve the nuclear agreement in two steps, the interim agreement and the final agreement.” Subsequent meetings with the Iranians followed, during which he was joined by Deputy Secretary of State Bill Burns. “Bill and I had a huge amount of license to explore what the terms would look like, within the negotiating parameters,” Sullivan says. “What the precise trade-offs would be, between forms of sanctions relief and forms of restraints on their programs, that was left to us to feel out.” The fact that the president largely let his surrogates do the talking and the selling of the Iran deal — and even now, rarely talks about it in public — does not reflect his level of direct engagement. Sullivan and Burns spent hours before and after every session in Oman with the president and his closest advisers in the White House. When the president wasn’t present, Rhodes always was. “Ben and I, in particular, the two of us, spent a lot of time thinking through all the angles,” Sullivan says. “We spent three, four, five hours together in Washington talking things through before the meetings.” In March 2013, a full three months before the elections that elevated Hassan Rouhani to the office of president, Sullivan and Burns finalized their proposal for an interim agreement, which became the basis for the J.C.P.O.A. The White House point person during the later stage of the negotiations was Rob Malley, a favored troubleshooter who is currently running negotiations that could keep the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad in power. During the course of the Iran talks, Malley told me, he always kept in close contact with Rhodes. “I would often just call him and say, ‘Give me a reality check,’ ” Malley explained. “He could say, ‘Here is where I think the president is, and here is where I think he will be.’ ” He continued, “Ben would try to anticipate: Does it make sense policywise? But then he would also ask himself: How do we sell it to Congress? How do we sell it to the public? What is it going to do to our narrative?” Malley is a particularly keen observer of the changing art of political communication; his father, Simon Malley, who was born in Cairo, edited the politics magazine Afrique Asie and proudly provided a platform for Fidel Castro and Yasir Arafat, in the days when the leaders’ words might take weeks to travel from Cuba or Cairo to Paris. “The Iran experience was the place where I saw firsthand how policy, politics and messaging all had to be brought together, and I think that Ben is really at the intersection of all three,” Malley says. “He reflects and he shapes at the same time.” As Malley and representatives of the State Department, including Wendy Sherman and Secretary of State John Kerry, engaged in formal negotiations with the Iranians, to ratify details of a framework that had already been agreed upon, Rhodes’s war room did its work on Capitol Hill and with reporters. In the spring of last year, legions of arms-control experts began popping up at think tanks and on social media, and then became key sources for hundreds of often-clueless reporters. “We created an echo chamber,” he admitted, when I asked him to explain the onslaught of freshly minted experts cheerleading for the deal. “They were saying things that validated what we had given them to say.” When I suggested that all this dark metafictional play seemed a bit removed from rational debate over America’s future role in the world, Rhodes nodded. “In the absence of rational discourse, we are going to discourse the [expletive] out of this,” he said. “We had test drives to know who was going to be able to carry our message effectively, and how to use outside groups like Ploughshares, the Iran Project and whomever else. So we knew the tactics that worked.” He is proud of the way he sold the Iran deal. “We drove them crazy,” he said of the deal’s opponents. Yet Rhodes bridled at the suggestion that there has been anything deceptive about the way that the agreement itself was sold. “Look, with Iran, in a weird way, these are state-to-state issues. They’re agreements between governments. Yes, I would prefer that it turns out that Rouhani and Zarif” — Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iran’s foreign minister — “are real reformers who are going to be steering this country into the direction that I believe it can go in, because their public is educated and, in some respects, pro-American. But we are not betting on that.” In fact, Rhodes’s passion seems to derive not from any investment in the technical specifics of sanctions or centrifuge arrays, or any particular optimism about the future course of Iranian politics and society. Those are matters for the negotiators and area specialists. Rather, it derived from his own sense of the urgency of radically reorienting American policy in the Middle East in order to make the prospect of American involvement in the region’s future wars a lot less likely. When I asked whether the prospect of this same kind of far-reaching spin campaign being run by a different administration is something that scares him, he admitted that it does. “I mean, I’d prefer a sober, reasoned public debate, after which members of Congress reflect and take a vote,” he said, shrugging. “But that’s impossible.” Getting Rhodes to speak directly about the man whose gestalt he channels is a bit like asking someone to look into a mirror while describing someone else’s face. The Obama he talks about in public is, in part, a character that he has helped to create — based on a real person, of course — and is embedded in story lines that he personally constructs and manages. At the same time, he believes very deeply in Obama, the man and the president, and in the policies that he has helped to structure and sell on his behalf. Obama’s particular revulsion against a certain kind of global power politics is a product, Rhodes suggests, of his having been raised in Southeast Asia. “Indonesia was a place where your interaction at that time with power was very intimate, right?” Rhodes asks. “Tens or hundreds of thousands of people had just been killed. Power was not some abstract thing,” he muses. “When we sit in Washington and debate foreign policy, it’s like a Risk game, or it’s all about us, or the human beings disappear from the decisions. But he lived in a place where he was surrounded by people who had either perpetrated those acts — and by the way, may not have felt great about that — or else knew someone who was a victim. I don’t think there’s ever been an American president who had an experience like that at a young age of what power is.” The parts of Obama’s foreign policy that disturb some of his friends on the left, like drone strikes, Rhodes says, are a result of Obama’s particular kind of globalism, which understands the hard and at times absolute necessity of killing. Yet, at the same time, they are also ways of avoiding more deadly uses of force — a kind of low-body-count spin move. He leans back and opens a drawer in the file cabinet behind his desk, and removes a folder. “I was going to show you something,” he says, removing a sheaf of yellow legal paper covered in longhand. “Just to confirm for you that he really is a writer.” He shows me the president’s copy of his Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech, a revision of an original draft by Favreau and Rhodes whose defining tension was accepting a prize awarded before he had actually accomplished anything. In his longhand notes, Obama relocated the speech’s tension in the fact that he was accepting a peace prize a week after ordering 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan. King and Gandhi were the author’s heroes, yet he couldn’t act as they did, because he runs a state. The reason that the author had to exercise power was because not everyone in the world is rational. We sit for a while, and I examine the president’s thoughts unfolding on the page, and the lawyerly, abstract nature of his writing process. “Moral imagination, spheres of identity, but also move beyond cheap lazy pronouncements,” one note reads. Here was the new American self — rational, moral, not self-indulgent. No longer one thing but multiple overlapping spheres or circles. Who is described here? As usual, the author is describing himself. Valerie Jarrett has been called the president’s work wife and is the only member of the West Wing staff who knew Obama before he began contemplating a run for the presidency. What I want to understand better, I tell her, are the swirls of the president’s emotional fingerprint, which I saw in the longhand draft of his Nobel speech. We talk for a while about being American and at the same time being from somewhere else, and the split-screen experience of reality that experience allows. Jarrett was born in Iran and spent her early childhood there. “Was it a point of connection between you and the president that you had each spent some substantial part of your childhoods living in another country?” I ask. Her face lights up. “Absolutely,” she answers. The question is important to her. “The first conversation we had over dinner, when we first met, was about what it was like for both of us to live in countries that were predominantly Muslim countries at formative parts of our childhood and the perspective it gave us about the United States and how uniquely excellent it is,” she says. “We talked about what it was like to be children, and how we played with children who had totally different backgrounds than our own but you would find something in common.” She recalls her very first dinner together with the new fiancé of her protégée Michelle Robinson. “I remember him asking me questions that I felt like no one else has ever asked me before,” she says, “and he asked me from a perspective of someone who knew the same experience that I had. So it felt really good. I was like, ‘Oh, finally someone who gets it.’ ” Barack Obama is not a standard-issue liberal Democrat. He openly shares Rhodes’s contempt for the groupthink of the American foreign-policy establishment and its hangers-on in the press. Yet one problem with the new script that Obama and Rhodes have written is that the Blob may have finally caught on. “He is a brilliant guy, but he has a real problem with what I call the assignment of bad faith,” one former senior official told me of the president. “He regards everyone on the other side at this point as being a bunch of bloodthirsty know-nothings from a different era who play by the old book. He hears arguments like, ‘We should be punching Iran in the nose on its shipments of arms, and do it publicly,’ or ‘We should sanction the crap out of them for their ballistic-missile test and tell them that if they do it again we’re going to do this or we’re going to do that,’ and he hears Dick Cheney in those arguments.” Another official I spoke to put the same point more succinctly: “Clearly the world has disappointed him.” When I asked whether he believed that the Oval Office debate over Syria policy in 2012 — resulting in a decision not to support the uprising against Assad in any meaningful way — had been an honest and open one, he said that he had believed that it was, but has since changed his mind. “Instead of adjusting his policies to the reality, and adjusting his perception of reality to the changing realities on the ground, the conclusions he draws are exactly the same, no matter what the costs have been to our strategic interests,” he says. “In an odd way, he reminds me of Bush.” The comparison is a startling one — and yet, questions of tone aside, it is uncomfortably easy to see the similarities between the two men, American presidents who projected their own ideas of the good onto an indifferent world. One of the few charter members of the Blob willing to speak on the record is Leon Panetta, who was Obama’s head of the C.I.A. and secretary of defense and also enough of a product of a different culture to give honest answers to what he understands to be questions of consequence. At his institute at the old Fort Ord in Seaside, Calif., where, in the days before he wore Mr. Rogers sweaters, he served as a young Army intelligence officer, I ask him about a crucial component of the administration’s public narrative on Iran: whether it was ever a salient feature of the C.I.A.’s analysis when he ran the agency that the Iranian regime was meaningfully divided between “hard-line” and “moderate” camps. “No,” Panetta answers. “There was not much question that the Quds Force and the supreme leader ran that country with a strong arm, and there was not much question that this kind of opposing view could somehow gain any traction.” I ask Panetta whether, as head of the C.I.A., or later on, as secretary of defense, he ever saw the letters that Obama covertly sent to Khamenei, in 2009 and in 2012, which were only reported on by the press weeks later. “No,” he answers, before saying he would “like to believe” that Tom Donilon, national security adviser since 2010, and Hillary Clinton, then secretary of state, had a chance to work on the offer they presented. As secretary of defense, he tells me, one of his most important jobs was keeping Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and his defense minister, Ehud Barak, from launching a pre-emptive attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities. “They were both interested in the answer to the question, ‘Is the president serious?’ ” Panetta recalls. “And you know my view, talking with the president, was: If brought to the point where we had evidence that they’re developing an atomic weapon, I think the president is serious that he is not going to allow that to happen.” Panetta stops. “But would you make that same assessment now?” I ask him. “Would I make that same assessment now?” he asks. “Probably not.” He understands the president’s pivot toward Iran as the logical result of a deeply held premise about the negative effects of use of American military force on a scale much larger than drone strikes or Special Forces raids. “I think the whole legacy that he was working on was, ‘I’m the guy who’s going to bring these wars to an end, and the last goddamn thing I need is to start another war,’ ” he explains of Obama. “If you ratchet up sanctions, it could cause a war. If you start opposing their interest in Syria, well, that could start a war, too.” In Panetta’s telling, his own experience at the Pentagon under Obama sometimes resembled being installed in the driver’s seat of a car and finding that the steering wheel and brakes had been disconnected from the engine. Obama and his aides used political elders like him, Robert Gates and Hillary Clinton as cover to end the Iraq war, and then decided to steer their own course, he suggests. While Panetta pointedly never mentions Rhodes’s name, it is clear whom he is talking about. “There were staff people who put themselves in a position where they kind of assumed where the president’s head was on a particular issue, and they thought their job was not to go through this open process of having people present all these different options, but to try to force the process to where they thought the president wanted to be,” he says. “They’d say, ‘Well, this is where we want you to come out.’ And I’d say ‘[expletive], that’s not the way it works. We’ll present a plan, and then the president can make a decision.’ I mean, Jesus Christ, it is the president of the United States, you’re making some big decisions here, he ought to be entitled to hear all of those viewpoints and not to be driven down a certain path.” But that can’t be true, I tell Panetta, because the aides he is talking about had no independent power aside from the authority that the president himself gave them. “Well, that’s a good question,” Panetta allows. “He’s a smart guy, he’s not dumb.” It’s all part of the Washington blame game. Just as Panetta can blame young aides in order to avoid blaming the president for his actual choices, the president used his aides to tell Panetta to take a hike. Perhaps the president and his aides were continually unable to predict the consequences of their actions in Syria, and made mistake after mistake, while imagining that it was going to come out right the next time. “Another read, which isn’t necessarily opposed to that,” I continue, “is that their actual picture is entirely coherent. But if they put it in blunt, unnuanced terms — ” Panetta completes my sentence: “ — they’d get the [expletive] kicked out of them.” He looks at me curiously. “Let me ask you something,” he says. “Did you present this theory to Ben Rhodes?” “Oh, God,” Rhodes says. “The reason the president has bucked a lot of establishment thinking is because he does not agree with establishment thinking. Not because I or Denis McDonough are sitting here.” He pushes back in his chair. “The complete lack of governance in huge swaths of the Middle East, that is the project of the American establishment,” he declares. “That as much as Iraq is what angered me.” There is something dangerously naïve about this kind of talk, in which words like “balance,” “stakeholders” and “interests” are endlessly reshuffled like word tiles in a magnetic-poetry set, with little regard for the immutable contingencies that shaped America’s role in the world. But that’s hardly fair. Ben Rhodes wanted to do right, and maybe, when the arc of history lands, it will turn out that he did. At least, he tried. Something scared him, and made him feel as if the grown-ups in Washington didn’t know what they were talking about, and it’s hard to argue that he was wrong. What has interested me most about watching him and his cohort in the White House over the past seven years, I tell him, is the evolution of their ability to get comfortable with tragedy. I am thinking specifically about Syria, I add, where more than 450,000 people have been slaughtered. “Yeah, I admit very much to that reality,” he says. “There’s a numbing element to Syria in particular. But I will tell you this,” he continues. “I profoundly do not believe that the United States could make things better in Syria by being there. And we have an evidentiary record of what happens when we’re there — nearly a decade in Iraq.” Iraq is his one-word answer to any and all criticism. I was against the Iraq war from the beginning, I tell Rhodes, so I understand why he perpetually returns to it. I also understand why Obama pulled the plug on America’s engagement with the Middle East, I say, but it was also true as a result that more people are dying there on his watch than died during the Bush presidency, even if very few of them are Americans. What I don’t understand is why, if America is getting out of the Middle East, we are apparently spending so much time and energy trying to strong-arm Syrian rebels into surrendering to the dictator who murdered their families, or why it is so important for Iran to maintain its supply lines to Hezbollah. He mutters something about John Kerry, and then goes off the record, to suggest, in effect, that the world of the Sunni Arabs that the American establishment built has collapsed. The buck stops with the establishment, not with Obama, who was left to clean up their mess. It is clearly time for me to go. Rhodes walks me out into the sunlight of the West Wing parking lot, where we are treated to the sight of the aged Henry Kissinger, who has come to pay a visit. I ask Rhodes if he has ever met the famous diplomat before, and he tells me about the time they were seated together at a state dinner for the president of China. It was an interesting encounter to imagine, between Kissinger, who made peace with Mao’s China while bombing Laos to bits, and Rhodes, who helped effect a similar diplomatic volte-face with Iran but kept the United States out of a civil war in Syria, which has caused more than four million people to become refugees. I ask Rhodes how it felt being seated next to the embodiment of American realpolitik. “It was surreal,” he says, looking off into the middle distance. “I told him I was going to Laos,” he continues. “He got a weird look in his eye.” There is nothing snarky about his delivery. Rhodes just was bothered by seeing legless kids and unexploded cluster bombs in the jungle. He is not Henry Kissinger, or so his logic runs, even as the underlying realist suspicion — or contempt — for the idea of America as a moral actor is eerily similar. He is torn. As the president himself once asked, how are we supposed to weigh the tens of thousands who have died in Syria against the tens of thousands who have died in Congo? What power means is that the choice is yours, no matter who is telling the story.

"C.I.A. Director Says Iran’s Economic Peril Helped Drive Nuclear Deal","Advertisement Supported by By  David E. Sanger CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — The director of the Central Intelligence Agency has provided the first public glimpse of American intelligence assessments about why Iran ’s leadership agreed to the tentative nuclear accord last week, saying that Iran’s president persuaded its supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , that their country’s economy was “destined to go down” unless he reached an understanding with the West. The C.I.A. director, John O. Brennan , speaking Tuesday night at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, suggested that a key to the deal was the election of President Hassan Rouhani, who had hardly been the supreme leader’s first choice. It took more than two years, he suggested, for the new president, a former nuclear negotiator himself, to persuade the far more isolated Ayatollah Khamenei that “six years of sanctions had really hit,” and that the economic future imperiled the country’s leadership. During this time, the ayatollah kept referring publicly to Iran’s “resistance economy,” a phrase that resounded among hard-liners who liked to portray the country as thriving by confronting the United States and its allies. Mr. Brennan also suggested that Ayatollah Khamenei, who has not spoken publicly about the accord but has also not permitted hard-liners to speak out against it, had performed a careful political calculation. If the effort to reach an accord collapsed, or the price seemed too high, prominent members of Mr. Rouhani’s government could be blamed, starting with the lead negotiator, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif. “I think Khamenei was in the position of being able to say to Rouhani and Zarif, ‘O.K., see if you can get a deal,’ ” said Mr. Brennan, speaking to hundreds of students in an hourlong interview conducted by Graham T. Allison, a Harvard professor and former dean of the school who specializes in nuclear strategy. “Because if you do, Khamenei is going to be able to derive the benefits from it, and if you don’t get one, Rouhani has Zarif to blame.” Mr. Brennan, who like other intelligence officials work to protect their “sources and methods,” did not say how the agency knew such details about the supreme leader — through human spies, electronic intercepts or an analysis of other intelligence. Even so, Mr. Brennan’s views are considered important because President Obama had said in recent days that he had sought an assessment of Ayatollah Khamenei’s intentions from the intelligence community, telling Thomas L. Friedman, a columnist for The New York Times, on Saturday that “he’s a pretty tough read — I don’t have great insight beyond what I think I get from our intelligence folks.” While Mr. Obama is usually deeply suspicious of intelligence reporting, his relationship with Mr. Brennan has been an especially tight one since the 2008 campaign. In Mr. Obama’s first term, Mr. Brennan was his top intelligence adviser. A guide to help you navigate the deal between global powers and Tehran. The process of getting Iran to negotiate took time, Mr. Brennan said, playing out long after two secret envoys from the Obama administration — a former deputy secretary of state, William J. Burns, and a former close adviser to Hillary Rodham Clinton, Jake Sullivan — made the first efforts to draw the Rouhani government into a conversation. “I think over time Rouhani was able to explain to Khamenei just how challenging the economic environment was in Iran right now, and it was destined to go down,” he said. “The only way they were going to address” the problem was to get sanctions lifted. Mr. Brennan’s account contrasted sharply with assessments made by American intelligence officials in 2009, when a much smaller deal with Iran on nuclear production fell apart after negotiations in Geneva and Vienna. At that time, Obama administration officials said the decision to abandon the deal had come from Ayatollah Khamenei himself. They did not say how they knew of his role, but it appeared that they had some capability to monitor his communications, or those of his aides. At the time, the sanctions on oil and financial transactions had not yet been imposed, and a cybersabotage program against Iran, code-named “Olympic Games,” was still developing. When pressed about the sabotage, Mr. Brennan indirectly acknowledged it had played a role in getting Iran to negotiate, suggesting the Iranians had been frustrated that they could not get their centrifuges and other equipment operating more quickly and more efficiently. But he was careful not to acknowledge the activity, and the United States has never talked publicly about its extensive sabotage program , which started under President George W. Bush and was accelerated by Mr. Obama. In private, many intelligence officials say that effort was at least as important as the sanctions. As Iran and world powers including the United States try to reach a deal on nuclear controls in exchange for the lifting of sanctions, Iranians from all walks of life are watching and hoping for a new start. Mr. Brennan’s description of Mr. Rouhani as a man who “has a history of engaging with the West, and he is much more practical and reasonable individual,” is bound to inflame the Israeli government. In October 2013, speaking at the United Nations, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Mr. Rouhani “a wolf in sheep’s clothing, a wolf who thinks he can pull the wool over the eyes of the international community.” In the same speech he described the Iranian president as a man who “thinks he can have his yellowcake and eat it, too,” referring to the raw uranium ore that can be processed into nuclear fuel. But Mr. Brennan suggested that the provisions of the accord that allow international inspectors to trace Iran’s efforts back to its uranium mills and mines, and track the fuel as it is sent off for processing — including into yellowcake — was important to improving intelligence collection about Iran’s nuclear capabilities. Mr. Brennan also dismissed as “wholly disingenuous” Mr. Netanyahu’s claim that the framework accord reached last Thursday in Lausanne, Switzerland, would provide Iran with a “pathway to a bomb.” Without naming Mr. Netanyahu directly, but quoting from his language , Mr. Brennan said that he was “pleasantly surprised” that the Iranians had given up as much as they did. He also backed the Obama administration’s assessment that the accord would greatly extend the amount of time it would take Iran to put together a bomb, either from plutonium or uranium. American and Iranian officials are using different words to describe elements of the preliminary agreement to limit Iran’s nuclear program. “When I look at the concessions that they made, going from 19,000 centrifuges to 6,000 centrifuges with 5,000 still operating, nobody thought they would do it,” Mr. Brennan said. The C.I.A.’s ability to detect covert nuclear sites has been mixed at best. More than a decade ago it detected, with the help of allies, the large enrichment plant at Natanz. Under the preliminary nuclear agreement, it would be the only site where Iran would be able to enrich uranium, in limited quantities. The agency missed a large underground site called Fordo, which was first detected by Britain and Israel, and it also missed a nearby nuclear reactor in Syria, built by North Korea and bombed by Israel in September 2007. Mr. Brennan expressed confidence that the C.I.A. would be able to build on the international inspections and detect new covert activity, saying “we’ve gone to school” on Iran’s nuclear infrastructure. Mr. Brennan hinted he had little expectation that the agreement would change Iran’s behavior in the region, including its sponsorship of terrorism. And he acknowledged that the increased revenue Iran would receive as sanctions are lifted could bolster those efforts. “I don’t think this is going to lead to a light switch and the Iranians are going to become passive, docile,” he said. An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of the Iran president name in a couple of instances. He is Hassan Rouhani, not Rhouhani. Advertisement"
"G7 summit will be a political fistfight for European members","Theresa May lands in Quebec for G7 with US sanctions and EU trade tariffs looming  Anne Perkins Deputy political editor  Thu 7 Jun 2018 22.34 BST   Last modified on Thu 5 Jul 2018 21.44 BST   Theresa May landed in Quebec on Thursday, swapping bruising rows with cabinet colleagues over Brexit for what could also be bruising confrontations between the US president Donald Trump and the other G7 members over tariffs and foreign policy. The 44th meeting of the G7 group of the world’s seven richest countries is taking place deep in rural Quebec in eastern Canada. The venue is a vast ski-and-golf resort that sits by a lake in the basin of a 34-mile crater left by a meteor strike millions of years ago. It writes its own metaphors. But the remote beauty of the landscape will not be matched by the atmosphere inside. The worthy agenda of gender equality and economic prosperity proposed by the host, the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau , is already deep in the shadow of an unprecedented series of rows among the G7 members. The combined pressure of six – France, Germany, the UK, Japan, Canada and Italy (the latter largely absent resolving domestic issues) – to persuade Trump either to stick with the Iran nuclear deal or to reconsider his determination to impose tariff barriers on steel and aluminium imports has so far failed. Tariffs are the more urgent issue. The EU has already handed the WTO a list of goods from jeans to motorbikes that would be covered by any tit for tat trade restrictions. In less than 30 days, damaging tariffs could be in place. Donald Trump’s victory in US election in November 2016 put the fate of the deal in doubt. He had promised prior to his election to “dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran”, although many believed he might instead adopt a more rigorous implementation of the agreement and tighten sanctions already in place. This could force Tehran to violate first or make the deal redundant. In January, he reluctantly waived a raft of sanctions against Iran as required by Congress every 120 days, but said “this is a last chance” and asked “European countries to join with the United States in fixing significant flaws in the deal”. The congressional deadline Trump faces this time is on 12 May, but he tweeted on Monday that he will announce his decision by Tuesday . Trump believes the agreement is a bad deal, which falls short of addressing Iran’s regional behaviour or its missile programme. He is emboldened by a group of Iran hawks in his inner circle, such as the national security adviser, John Bolton , and the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo . The UK exports around 7% of steel production and 3% of aluminium to the US. Last week, despite reservations by the international trade secretary Liam Fox, the government announced it would join any EU action . On Iran, the battle now is to protect EU companies from US sanctions. The UK, France and Germany have signed a joint letter demanding that European companies are spared from US sanctions imposed on Iran after Trump’s decision to pull out of the nuclear agreement with Tehran known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). May, in her first face to face meeting with the world leaders who backed her by introducing diplomatic sanctions over the poisoning of the Skripals in Salisbury three months ago, will also want to restate her commitment to a rules-based international order, and her determination to prevent the normalisation of chemical weapons. She will also have the chance of a quiet word with both Angela Merkel the German Chancellor, and President Macron with little more than a fortnight to go before the EU summit. But the wider themes in Quebec are empowering women and girls and promoting a sustainable environment. May will call for a united front to press the industry to ensure women can use the web without fear of being subjected to online rape threats, harassment, cyberstalking, blackmail, vile comments and more. If you have been affected you can share your stories with us, anonymously if you wish, by using our encrypted form here . We will feature some of your contributions in our reporting. She wants the techniques now widely used to tackle online terrorist propaganda to be extended to end abuse targeted specifically at women and girls, in particular content promoting or depicting violence against women and girls, including illegal violent pornography and rape threats on social media platforms. May believes the UK has developed a pioneering legal framework to tackle online harms. The government is planning legislation on a mandatory social media code of practice , transparency reporting and online advertising. A white paper is due later this year. In remarks trailed in advance, the prime minister plans to say: “What is illegal offline is illegal online and I am calling on world leaders to take serious action to deal with this, just like we are doing in the UK with our commitment to legislate on online harms such as cyberstalking and harassment.” On World Oceans Day , Michael Gove, the environment secretary will also announce plans for increasing the number of marine conservation zones from 50 to 91. These will prevent activities such as dredging, or “significant” onshore or offshore development and stop existing harmful activities. The new zones are intended to protected species such as the short snouted seahorse, stalked jellyfish and peacock’s tail seaweed and a dozen other exotically-named marine creatures. In Canada, May will urge collective action to tackle “this shared environmental challenge”. In her speech she will say: “Marine plastics pollution is one of the greatest environmental challenges facing the world today. “The UK government is a world leader on this issue, with our 25 Year Environment Plan setting out a clear ambition to eliminate avoidable plastic waste to protect our rivers and seas. “There is an urgent need for greater global action and coordination on marine plastics pollution, including working with business, industry and non-governmental organisations to find innovative and effective solutions. “This is a global problem, requiring global solutions.”"
"US accuses Israel of spying on nuclear talks with Iran","Israel denies Wall Street Journal reports that it shared confidential information from talks with members of the US Congress in attempt to derail any deal  Julian Borger Diplomatic editor,  Mairav Zonszein in Tel Aviv, and  Sabrina Siddiqui in New York  Tue 24 Mar 2015 14.50 GMT   First published on Tue 24 Mar 2015 08.55 GMT   The US has accused Israel of spying on international negotiations over Iran’s nuclear programme and using the intelligence gathered to persuade Congress to undermine the talks, according to a report on Tuesday. The Wall Street Journal cited senior administration officials as saying the Israeli espionage operation began soon after the US opened up a secret channel of communications with Tehran in 2012, aimed at resolving the decade-long standoff over Iran’s nuclear aspirations. The apparent decision by the White House to leak the allegations is the latest symptom of the growing gulf between Barack Obama’s administration and Binyamin Netanyahu’s government over the Iran talks, in which the Israeli leader suspects US officials of being ready to make too many concessions at the expense of Israeli security. Intelligence analysts suggested that the leak reflects the degree of anger in Washington at Netanyahu’s actions, and could mark a more serious blow to the already tottering relationship. The leak has come exactly a week before a deadline for the US-Iranian negotiations in Lausanne to produce a framework agreement. According to the report, the US has long been aware that Israel is among the shortlist of countries with the most aggressive intelligence operations targeting America, alongside Russia, China and France. It said American diplomats attending the talks in Austria and Switzerland were briefed by US counterintelligence officials about the threat of Israeli eavesdropping. It also raised the possibility that Israel gathered intelligence about the US position by spying on other participants in the negotiations, from western Europe, Russia, China or Iran. US intelligence had previously provided help to the Israelis to spy on the Iranians, the report said. The US also conducts intelligence operations against Israel, and learned of the Israeli spying operation when it intercepted communication between Israeli officials exchanging classified information that US intelligence believed could only have been acquired by espionage. However, what appears to have upset administration officials more than the spying is the use of the classified intelligence acquired to brief members of the US Congress and to persuade them to torpedo the talks. After Netanyahu addressed Congress this month , 47 Republican senators wrote an open letter to the Iranian leadership, warning it that a successor to Obama could refuse to honour any agreement reached. “It is one thing for the US and Israel to spy on each other. It is another thing for Israel to steal US secrets and play them back to US legislators to undermine US diplomacy,” the Wall Street Journal quoted a senior US official as saying. Israel has categorically denied the allegations that it spied on closed-door nuclear negotiations between Iran and the US, however it did not deny that such information had been obtained. “I think the report is wrong, it is inaccurate,” the outgoing Israeli foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, told the country’s Army Radio on Tuesday morning. “The State of Israel obviously has various security interests and we have excellent intelligence services, but we are not engaged in espionage against the United States.” He did not, however, deny information was obtained. Lieberman said: “All the information we gathered was from another entity, not the US.” He added: “We reached a decision a long time ago not to spy on the US and I haven’t come across anyone who has violated that instruction in several decades.” Ronen Bergman, an expert on the country’s intelligence agencies at the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper, said: “Whatever you think of Netanyahu’s position on the Iran talks, if he thinks that Israel’s national security is at stake, he has the right to order the intelligence community to find out what is happening.” But Bergman – whose book, A History of the Israeli Mossad, will be published next year – added: “What worries me and what should be of high concern to the leaders of Israel is that this is ample proof that the relations at large between the US and Israel are sustaining an earthquake. The fact that it is happening is less worrying than that it was leaked. Also, any intervention by Israel in the inner working of American politics is wrong. If this report is true and Netanyahu’s intervention used intelligence material, then it is just making it worse.” Yuval Steinitz, the strategic affairs minister and close Netanyahu aide, told Israel’s Channel 2 that the reports were “intended to damage the strong ties between the US and Israel, despite our differences on the Iran issue”. The Speaker of the House of Representatives, John Boehner , said he was “baffled” by the report and denied having received any information from Israel. “I read that story this morning, and frankly, I was a bit shocked, because there’s no information revealed to me whatsoever,” Boehner, a Republican from Ohio, told reporters at a press briefing. “I was shocked by the fact that there were reports in this press article that information was being passed on from the Israelis to members of Congress. I’m not aware of that at all. I’m baffled by it.” Other lawmakers also pleaded ignorance when asked about the allegations, which marked the latest front in the escalating row between Netanyahu and Barack Obama. Members of both parties insisted they are regularly briefed on the Iran negotiations by the administration – and no one else. “No one from Israel’s ever briefed me about the agreement,” the South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican, told reporters. “If they’re spying, they’re not telling me about it.”"
"How to Understand What’s Happening in North Korea","Advertisement Supported by By  Nicholas Kristof Opinion Columnist North Korea doesn’t have enough food, it lacks Facebook and Beyoncé, and its diplomats have to ration their use of computers in the Foreign Ministry because of electricity shortages. But North Korea excels at choreography and theater, and its officials are well educated, very savvy, and agile with a pirouette. So we have peace breaking out on the Korean Peninsula — and President Trump gets some credit for that. As with any circus performance, it’s amazing to behold but not quite as billed. As Kim Jong-un stepped into South Korea on Friday — the first North Korean leader to do so — let’s acknowledge that he has played a weak hand exceptionally well. Kim is now aiming to squirm out of sanctions, build up his economy and retain his nuclear arsenal, all while remaining a global focus of attention. It’s a remarkable performance. “North Korea expert” is an oxymoron, but from someone who has been covering the country since the 1980s, here’s my take on why we should be deeply skeptical — and yet relieved, even a bit hopeful. President Trump’s tightening of sanctions and his belligerent rhetoric genuinely did change the equation. All this was meant to intimidate Kim, but it mostly alarmed President Moon Jae-in of South Korea and galvanized him to undertake successful Olympic diplomacy that laid the groundwork for the North-South summit meeting. Kim then parlayed that progress into meetings with both Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, both of which reflected longtime North Korean goals. And on Friday Kim and Moon adopted a declaration promising “no more war,” “a new era of peace” and “complete denuclearization.” Inspiring, but count me skeptical. North and South Korean leaders have signed grand peace documents before, in 2000 and 2007 , and neither lasted. In 2012, North Korea agreed not to test missiles and then weeks later fired one off but called it a “satellite” launch. When North Korea talks about “complete denuclearization,” it typically means that the U.S. ends its alliance with South Korea, and then North Korea will no longer need nuclear weapons to defend itself. But the U.S. won’t give up the South. And North Korea has been pursuing nuclear weapons since the 1950s, and I don’t know any expert who thinks that it will genuinely hand over its arsenal. On my last visit to North Korea , in September, a Foreign Ministry official told me that Libya had given up its nuclear program — only to have its regime toppled. Likewise, he noted, Saddam Hussein’s Iraq lacked a nuclear deterrent — so Saddam was ousted by America. North Korea would not make the same mistake, he insisted. It’s even less likely that North Korea will give up its nukes now that it sees Trump poised to tear up the Iran nuclear deal. Kim’s game plan seems to be to sign pledges for denuclearization, leaving details to be worked out in follow-up talks, knowing that the pledges won’t be fully implemented and that there will never be intrusive inspections. This may be disingenuous on the part of North Korea, but that’s not terrible: It provides a face-saving way for both North Korea and the U.S. to back away from the precipice of war. Trump and Kim both badly want a meeting, so expect North Korea to release its three American detainees in the coming weeks and to make soothing statements. Trump and Kim will present themselves as historic peacemakers as they sign some kind of declaration calling for peace and denuclearization, with some kind of timetable; Trump’s aides will then say that he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize more than Barack Obama did. I hope Trump will also raise human rights issues. A commission of inquiry suggested that North Korea has committed crimes against humanity “on a massive scale” in its labor camps, and we should push for access to these camps by humanitarian organizations. “Over 100,000 people, a figure that includes countless innocent family members of so-called enemies of the state, are effectively consigned to die in North Korea’s political prisons,” Navi Pillay, a former U.N. high commissioner for human rights, told me. “The forced abortions, infanticide, persecution of Christians, torture and summary executions that regularly occur in those various facilities are well documented. President Trump can demand that the Red Cross and the international community be given access to North Korea’s prisons and labor camp systems.” In the meantime, I’m guessing that the North will halt all nuclear and missile testing (hopefully, including short-range missiles), and will stop production of plutonium at its reactors in Yongbyon (North Korea may also claim to stop enriching uranium, but that’s more difficult to verify). In exchange, China and South Korea will quietly ease sanctions — and Kim will get what he has always wanted, the legitimacy of being treated as a world leader, as an equal, and as the ruler of a de facto nuclear state. Both Kim and Trump benefit politically from that scenario, and for that matter so does the world: Hard-liners will fume that we’re being played and that the North is not verifiably giving up nuclear weapons — true — but it’s all preferable to war. How does this end? The West’s plan is to drag things along until the North collapses. This may happen. The problem is that it was also the U.S. plan in 1994 in a previous nuclear deal. And I confess that I chose to be The New York Times’s bureau chief in Tokyo in the late 1990s partly so that I could cover what I thought might be the collapse soon of the North Korean regime. I learned then not to make predictions about the timing of the demise of the Kim dynasty. In effect, the emerging framework is a backdoor route to a nuclear cap or to the “freeze for a freeze” solution that North Korea and China have previously recommended and that Trump has rejected. It may all fall apart. But it’s possible now to envision a path away from war, and for that even we skeptics should be grateful. Opinion Bret Stephens Advertisement"
"Joint News Conference by Trump and Putin: Full Video and Transcript","Advertisement Supported by After meeting privately in Helsinki, Finland, on Monday, President Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia held a joint news conference. Following is a transcript as prepared by the Federal News Service. For more coverage, read our live updates , and this analysis . ___________ Mr. Putin (through an interpreter): Thank you so much. Shall we start working? I guess. Distinguished Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, negotiations with the president of the United States, Donald Trump, took place in a frank and businesslike atmosphere. I think we can call it a success and a very fruitful round of negotiations. We carefully analyzed the current status, the present and the future of the Russia-United States relationship, key issues of the global agenda. Mr. Putin: It’s quite clear to everyone that the bilateral relationship are going through a complicated stage, and yet those impediments, the current tension, the tense atmosphere, essentially have no solid reason behind it. The Cold War is a thing of past, the era of acute ideological confrontation of the two countries is a thing of remote past, is a vestige of the past. The situation in the world changed dramatically. Today, both Russia and the United States face a whole new set of challenges. Those include a dangerous maladjustment of mechanisms for maintaining international security and stability, regional crises, the creeping threats of terrorism and transnational crime, the snowballing problems in the economy, environmental risks and other sets of challenges. We can only cope with these challenges if we join ranks and work together. Hopefully we will reach this understanding with our American partners. Today’s negotiations reflected our joint wish — our joint wish with President Trump to readdress this negative situation in the bilateral relationship. I outlined first steps for improving this relationship, to restore the acceptable level of trust and going back to the previous level of interaction on all mutual interest issues. As major nuclear powers, we bear special responsibility for maintaining international security. (inaudible) vital — and we mentioned this here in the negotiations — it’s crucial that we fine-tune the dialogue on strategic stability and global security and nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. We submitted our American colleagues a note with a number of specific suggestions. We believe it necessary to work together further on — to interact on the disarmament agenda, military and technical cooperation. This includes the extension of the Strategic Offensive Arms Limitation Treaty. It’s a dangerous situation with a global American antimissile defense system, it’s the implementation issues with the INF [intermediate-range nuclear forces] treaty. And, of course, the agenda of non-placement of weapons in space. Mr. Putin: We favor the continued cooperation in counterterrorism and maintaining cybersecurity. And I’d like to point out specifically that our special services are cooperating quite successfully together. The most recent example is their operational cooperation within the recently concluded World Football Cup . In general, the context among the special services should be put to a systemwide basis — should be brought to a systemic framework. I recall I reminded President Trump about this suggestion to re-establish the working group on antiterrorism. We also mentioned a plethora of regional crises. It’s not always that our postures dovetail exactly, and yet the overlapping and mutual interests abound. We have to look for points of contact and interact closer in a variety of international forum. Clearly, we mentioned the regional crisis, for instance Syria. As far as Syria is concerned, the task of establishing peace and reconciliation in this country could be the first showcase example of the successful joint work. Russia and the United States apparently can act proactively and take considerable leadership on this issue, and organize the interaction to overcome humanitarian crisis and help Syrian refugees to go back to their homes. Mr. Putin: In order to accomplish this level of successful cooperation in Syria, we have all the required components. Let me remind you of that. Both Russian and American military have acquired the useful experience of coordination of their action, established the operational channels of communication which permit it to avoid dangerous incidents and unintentional collisions in the air and in the ground. Also crushing terrorists in the southwest of Syria. The south of Syria should be brought to the full compliance with the treaty of 1974, about the separation of forces — about separation of forces of Israel and Syria. This will bring peace to Golan Heights, and bring more peaceful relationship between Syria and Israel, and also to provide security of the state of Israel. Mr. President paid special attention to the issue during today’s negotiations. And I would like to confirm that Russia is interested in this development and will act accordingly. Thus far, we will make a step toward creating a lasting peace in compliance with the respective resolutions of Security Council, for instance, the Resolution 338. We are glad that the Korean Peninsula issue is starting to resolve. To a great extent, it was possible thanks to the personal engagement of President Trump, who opted for dialogue instead of confrontation. We also mentioned our concern about the withdrawal of the United States from the JCPOA [the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, commonly known as the Iran nuclear deal]. Well, the U.S. — our U.S. counterparts are aware of our posture. Let me remind you that thanks to the Iranian nuclear deal, Iran became the most controlled country in the world. It submitted to the control of IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency]. It effectively ensured the exclusively peaceful nature of Iranian nuclear program and strengthened the nonproliferation regime. While we discussed the internal Ukrainian crisis, we paid special attention to the bona fide implementation of Minsk Agreements by Kiev. At the same time, United States could be more decisive in nudging the Ukrainian leadership, and encourage it to work actively on this. We paid more attention to economic ties and economic cooperation. It’s clear that both countries — the business of both countries are interested in this. American delegation was one of the largest delegations in the St. Petersburg Economic Forum. It featured over 500 representatives from American businesses. We agreed — me and President Trump — we agreed to create a high-level working group that would bring together captains of Russian and American business. After all, entrepreneurs and businessmen know better how to articulate this successful business cooperation. We’ll let them think and make their proposals and suggestions in this regard. Once again, President Trump mentioned the issue of the so-called interference of Russia with the American elections, and I had to reiterate things I said several times, including during our personal contacts, that the Russian state has never interfered and is not going to interfere into internal American affairs, including election process. Mr. Putin: Any specific material — if such things arise — we are ready to analyze together. For instance, we can analyze them through the joint working group on cybersecurity, the establishment of which we discussed during our previous contacts. And clearly, it’s past time we restore our cooperation in the cultural area and the humanitarian area. As far as — I think you know that recently we hosted the American Congressional Delegation , and now it’s perceived and portrayed almost as a historic event, while — although it should have been just a current affairs, just business as usual. And in this regard, we mentioned this proposal to the president, we have to think about practicalities of our cooperation, but also about the rationality of the underlying logic of it. And we have to engage experts on bilateral relationship who know history and the background of our relationship. The idea is to create an expert council that would include political scientists, prominent diplomats and former military experts from both countries who would look for points of contact between the two countries and would look for ways on putting the relationship on the trajectory of growth. In general, we are glad with the outcome of our first full-scale meeting, because previously we only had a chance to talk briefly on international fora. We had a good conversation with President Trump, and I hope that we start to understand each other better. And I’m grateful to Donald for it. Clearly there are some challenges left when we were not able to clear all the backlog, but I think that we made the first important step in this direction. And in conclusion, I want to point out that this atmosphere of cooperation is something that we are especially grateful for to our Finnish hosts. We are grateful for Finnish people and Finnish leadership for what they’ve done. I know that we’ve caused some inconvenience to Finland and we apologize for it. Thank you for your attention. President Trump: Thank you very much. Thank you. I have just concluded a meeting with President Putin on a wide range of critical issues for both of our countries. We had direct, open, deeply productive dialogue. Went very well. Before I begin, I want to thank President Niinisto of Finland for graciously hosting today’s summit. President Putin and I were saying how lovely it was and what a great job they did. I also want to congratulate Russia and President Putin for having done such an excellent job in hosting the World Cup. It was really one of the best ever. And your team also did very well. It was a great job. I’m here today to continue the proud tradition of bold American diplomacy. From the earliest days of our republic, American leaders have understood that diplomacy and engagement is preferable to conflict and hostility. A productive dialogue is not only good for the United States and good for Russia, but it is good for the world. The disagreements between our two countries are well known and President Putin and I discussed them at length today. But if we’re going to solve many of the problems facing our world, then we’re going to have to find ways to cooperate in pursuit of shared interests. Mr. Trump: Too often, in both recent past and long ago, we have seen the consequences when diplomacy is left on the table. We’ve also seen the benefits of cooperation. In the last century, our nations fought alongside one another in the Second World War. Even during the tensions of the Cold War, when the world looked much different than it does today, the United States and Russia were able to maintain a strong dialogue. But our relationship has never been worse than it is now. However, that changed as of about four hours ago. I really believe that. Nothing would be easier politically than to refuse to meet, to refuse to engage, but that would not accomplish anything. As president, I cannot make decisions on foreign policy in a futile effort to appease partisan critics, or the media, or Democrats who want to do nothing but resist and obstruct. Constructive dialogue between the United States and Russia affords the opportunity to open new pathways toward peace and stability in our world. I would rather take a political risk in pursuit of peace than to risk peace in pursuit of politics. As president, I will always put what is best for America and what is best for the American people. During today’s meeting, I addressed directly with President Putin the issue of Russian interference in our elections. I felt this was a message best delivered in person. Spent a great deal of time talking about it. And President Putin may very well want to address it, and very strongly, because he feels very strongly about it, and he has an interesting idea. We also discussed one of the most critical challenges facing humanity: nuclear proliferation. I provided an update on my meeting last month with Chairman Kim on the denuclearization of North Korea. And after today, I am very sure that President Putin and Russia want very much to end that problem, going to work with us. And I appreciate that commitment. The president and I also discussed the scourge of radical Islamic terrorism. Both Russia and the United States has suffered horrific terrorist attacks, and we have agreed to maintain open communication between our security agencies to protect our citizens from this global menace. Last year, we told Russia about a planned attack in St. Petersburg, and they were able to stop it cold. They found them. They stopped them. There was no doubt about it. I appreciated President Putin’s phone call afterwards to thank me. I also emphasized the importance of placing pressure on Iran to halt its nuclear ambitions, and to stop its campaign of violence throughout the area, throughout the Middle East. As we discussed at length, the crisis in Syria is a complex one. Cooperation between our two countries has the potential to save hundreds of thousands of lives. I also made clear that the United States will not allow Iran to benefit from our successful campaign against ISIS. We have just about eradicated ISIS in the area. Mr. Trump: We also agreed that representatives from our national security councils will meet to follow up on all of the issues we addressed today, and to continue the progress we have started right here in Helsinki. Today’s meeting is only the beginning of a longer process, but we have taken the first step toward a brighter future and one with a strong dialogue and a lot of thought. Our expectations are grounded in realism, but our hopes are grounded in America’s desire for friendship, cooperation and peace. And I think I can speak on behalf of Russia, when I say that, also. President Putin, I want to thank you again for joining me for these important discussions and for advancing open dialogue between Russia and the United States. Our meeting carries on a long tradition of diplomacy between Russia, the United States, for the greater good of all. And this was a very constructive day, this was a very constructive few hours that we spent together. It’s in the interest of both of our countries to continue our conversation, and we have agreed to do so. I’m sure we’ll be meeting again in the future often, and hopefully we will solve every one of the problems that we discussed today. So again, President Putin, thank you very much. Russian aide (through an interpreter): Distinguished presidents, now the journalists would have a chance to ask two questions, two sets of questions each. First the Russian journalist will ask the question. Please give your affiliation. Question  (through an interpreter): Good afternoon, my name is Alex Amashkov (ph), Interfax Information Agency. I have a question to President Trump. During your recent European tour, you mentioned that implementation of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline makes Europe a hostage of Russia, and you suggested that you could free Europe from this by supplying American LNG. But this cold winter actually showed that the current modal — current mechanism of supply of fuel to Europe is quite viable. At the same time, as far as I know, U.S. had to buy even Russian gas for Boston. I have a question: The implementation of your idea has a political tinge to it or is it a practical one? Because there will be a gap formed in the supply-and-demand mechanism and the first is the consuming countries who will fall into this gap. And the second question, before the meeting with President Putin, you called him an adversary, a rival, and yet you expressed hope that you will be able to bring this relationship to a new level. Did you manage to do this? Mr. Trump: Well, actually I called him a competitor. And a good competitor he is. And I think the word “competitor” is a compliment. I think that we will be completing when you talk about the pipeline. I’m not sure, necessarily, that it’s in the best interests of Germany or not, but that was a decision that they made. We’ll be competing — as you know, the United States is now — or soon will be, but I think it actually is right now the largest in the oil and gas world. So we’re going to be selling LNG, and we’ll have to be competing with the pipeline and I think will compete successfully, although there is a little advantage locationally. So I just wish them luck. I mean, I did. I discussed with Angela Merkel in pretty strong tones. But I also know where they’re all coming from and they have a very close source. So we’ll see how that all works out. Mr. Trump: But we have lots of sources now and the United States is much different than it was a number of years ago when we weren’t able to extract what we could extract today. So today we’re number one in the world at that, and I think we’ll be out there competing very strongly. Thank you very much. Mr. Putin (through an interpreter): If I may, I’d throw in some two cents. We talked to Mr. President, including this subject as well. We are aware of the stance of President Trump, and I think that we, as a major oil and gas power, and the United States as a major oil and gas power as well, we could work together on regulation of international markets, because neither of us is actually interested in the plummeting of the prices. And the consumers will suffer as well, and the consumers in the United States will suffer as well. And the shale gas production will suffer. Because beyond a sudden price breakup, it’s no longer profitable to — to produce gas. But nor we are interested in driving prices up, because it will drain just as — just as from all other sectors of the economy, from (inaudible) building, et cetera. So we do have space for cooperation here. That’s the first thing. Then about the Nord Stream 2, Mr. President voiced his concerns about the possibility of disappearance of transit through Ukraine. And I reassured Mr. President that Russia stands ready to maintain this transit. Moreover, we stand ready to extend this transit contract that’s about to expire next year in case — if the dispute between the economic entitles — dispute will be settled in the Stockholm arbitration court. American aide: [The next question] goes to Jeff Mason from Reuters. Question : Thank you. Mr. President, you tweeted this morning that it’s U.S. foolishness, stupidity and the Mueller probe that is responsible for the decline in U.S. relations with Russia.Do you hold Russia at all accountable for anything in particular? And if so, what would you — what would you consider them — that they are responsible for? Mr. Trump: Yes I do. I hold both countries responsible. I think that the United States has been foolish. I think we’ve all been foolish. We should’ve had this dialogue a long time ago; a long time, frankly, before I got to office. And I think we’re all to blame. I think that the United States now has stepped forward along with Russia, and we’re getting together and we have a chance to do some great things, whether it’s nuclear proliferation in terms of stopping — you have to do it, ultimately that’s probably the most important thing that we could be working on. But I do feel that we have both made some mistakes. I think that the — the probe is a disaster for our country. I think it’s kept us apart, it’s kept us separated. There was no collusion at all. Everybody knows it. And people are being brought out to the fore. So far that I know, virtually none of it related to the campaign. And they’re going to have to try really hard to find somebody that did relate to the campaign. That was a clean campaign. I beat Hillary Clinton easily. And, frankly, we beat her — and I’m not even saying from the standpoint — we won that race. And it’s a shame that there could even be a little bit of a cloud over it. People know that, people understand it. But the main thing — and we discussed this also — zero collusion. And it has had a negative impact upon the relationship of the two largest nuclear powers in the world. We have 90 percent of nuclear power between the two countries. It’s ridiculous. It’s ridiculous what’s going on with the probe. Question : For President Putin, if I could follow up as well, why should Americans and why should President Trump believe your statement that Russia did not intervene in the 2016 election, given the evidence that U.S. intelligence agencies have provided? And will you consider extraditing the 12 Russian officials that were indicted last week by a U.S. grand jury ? Mr. Trump: Well, I’m going to let the president answer the second part of that question. But, as you know, the whole concept of that came up perhaps a little bit before, but it came out as a reason why the Democrats lost an election which, frankly, they should have been able to win, because the Electoral College is much more advantageous for Democrats, as you know, than it is to Republicans. We won the Electoral College by a lot: 306 to 223, I believe. And that was a well-fought — that was a well-fought battle. We did a great job. And, frankly — I’m going to let the president speak to the second part of your question — but just to say it one time again — and I say it all the time — there was no collusion. I didn’t know the president. There was nobody to collude with. There was no collusion with the campaign. And every time you hear all of these, you know, 12 and 14 — it’s stuff that has nothing to do — and, frankly, they admit these are not people involved in the campaign. But to the average reader out there, they’re saying, “Well, maybe that does.” It doesn’t. And even the people involved, some, perhaps, told mis-stories. Or, in one case, the F.B.I. said there was no lying. There was no lying. Somebody else said there was. We ran a brilliant campaign, and that’s why I’m president. Thank you. Mr. Putin (through an interpreter): As to who is to be believed and to who’s not to be believed, you can trust no one if you take this. Where did you get this idea that President Trump trusts me or I trust him? He defends the interests of the United States of America, and I do defend the interests of the Russian Federation. We do have interests that are common. We are looking for points of contact. There are issues where our postures diverge, and we are looking for ways to reconcile our differences, how to make our effort more meaningful. We should not proceed from the immediate political interests that guide certain political powers in our countries. We should be guided by facts. Could you name a single fact that would definitely prove the collusion? This is utter nonsense, just like the president recently mentioned. Yes, the public at large in the United States had a certain perceived opinion of the candidates during the campaign. But there’s nothing particularly extraordinary about it. That’s the usual thing. President Trump, when he was a candidate, he mentioned the need to restore the Russia-U.S. relationship. And it’s clear that certain parts of American society felt sympathetic about it, and different people could express their sympathies in different ways. But isn’t that natural? Isn’t it natural to be sympathetic towards a person who is willing to restore the relationship with our country, who wants to work with us? We heard the accusations about a conquered country. Well, as far as I know, this company hired American lawyers and the accusations doesn’t have a fighting change in the American courts. So there’s no evidence when it comes to the actual facts. So we have to be guided by facts and not by rumors. Now let’s get back to the issue of these 12 alleged intelligence officers of — of Russia. Mr. Putin: I don’t know the full extent of the situation, but President Trump mentioned this issue and I will look into it. So far, I can say the following things off the top of my head. We have enacting an existing agreement between the United States of America and the Russian Federation, an existing treaty that dates back to 1999. The Mutual Assistance on Criminal Cases. This treaty is in full effect. It works quite efficiently. On average, we initiate about 100, 150 criminal cases upon request from foreign states. For instance, the last year there was one extradition case upon the request sent by the United States. So this treaty has specific legal procedures we can offer the appropriate commission headed by Special Attorney Mueller. He can use this treaty as a solid foundation and send a formal — an official request to us so that we would interrogate — we want to hold a questioning of these individuals who he believes are privy to some crimes. And our law enforcement are perfectly able to do this questioning and send the appropriate materials to the United States. Moreover, we can meet you halfway. We can make another step. We can actually permit official representatives of the United States, including the members of this very commission headed by Mr. Mueller — we can let them into the country and they will be present at this questioning. But in this case, there is a — there’s another condition. This kind of effort should be a mutual one. Then we would expect that the Americans would reciprocate, and that they would question officials, including the officers of law enforcement and intelligence service of the United States, whom we believe are — who have something to do with illegal actions on the territory of Russia, and we have to — to request the presence of our law enforcement. For instance, we can bring up the Mr. [William F. ] Browder in this particular case. Business associates of Mr. Browder have earned over $1.5 billion in Russia. They never paid any taxes, neither in Russia nor in the United States, and yet the money escaped the country. They were transferred to the United States. They sent huge amount of money, $400 million as a contribution to the campaign of Hillary Clinton. Well, that’s the personal case. It might have been legal, the contribution itself, but the way the money was earned was illegal. So we have a solid reason to believe that some intelligence officers accompanied and guided these transactions. So we have a — an interest of questioning them. We can all — that — that could be a first step, and we can also extend it. Options abound, and they all can be found in an appropriate legal framework. Question: President Putin, did you want President Trump to win the election and did you direct any of your officials to help him do that? Mr. Putin (through an interpreter): Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because he talked about bringing the U.S.-Russia relationship back to normal. Russian aide (through an interpreter): I think there can be three questions from the Russian pool. Russia Today, you have the floor. Question  (through an interpreter) : Thank you so much. Good evening to everyone. My name is Ilya Petrenko, RT TV channel. ( Now speaking in English .) Mr. President, would you please go into the details of possibly any specific arrangements for the U.S. to work together with Russia in Syria, if any of these kind of arrangements were made today or discussed? (Now through an interpreter): And my question to President Putin in Russian. Since we — we brought up the issue of football several times, I ask — use the football language. Mr. Pompeo mentioned that when we talk about the Syrian cooperation, the ball is in the Syrian court. Mr. Putin — in the Russian court — is it true? And how would you use this fact, the — the — having the ball? Mr. Trump: Well, I guess I’ll answer the first part of the question. We’ve worked with Israel long and hard for many years, many decades. I think we’ve never — never has anyone, any country been closer than we are. President Putin also is helping Israel. And we both spoke with Bibi Netanyahu, and they would like to do certain things with respect to Syria, having to do with the safety of Israel. So in that respect, we absolutely would like to work in order to help Israel. And Israel would be working with us. So both countries would work jointly. And I think that when you look at all of the progress that’s been made in certain sections, with the eradication of ISIS, we’re about 98 percent, 99 percent there. And other things that have taken place that we’ve done, and that, frankly, Russia has helped us with in certain respects. But I think that working with Israel is a great thing. And creating safety for Israel is something that both President Putin and I would like to see very much. One little thing I might add to that is the helping of people. Helping of people. Because you have such horrible — if you see — and I’ve seen reports, I’ve seen pictures, I’ve seen just about everything. And if we can do something to help the people of Syria get back into some form of shelter, and — on a humanitarian basis — and that’s what the word was, really, a humanitarian basis — I think that both of us would be very interested in doing that. And we are. We will do that. O.K.? Thank you very much. Question : Excuse me, but for now, no specific agreements, for instance, between the militaries... Mr. Trump: Well, our militaries do get along. In fact, our militaries actually have gotten along probably better than our political leaders, for years. But our militaries do get along very well, and they do coordinate in Syria and other places. O.K.? Thank you. Mr. Putin (through an interpreter): Yes. We did mention this. We mentioned the humanitarian track of this issue. Yesterday, I discussed this with French President Mr. Macron. And we reached an agreement that, together with European countries including France, we will step up this effort. On our behalf, we provide military cargo aircraft to deliver the humanitarian cargo. And today, I brought up this issue with President Trump. I think there is plenty of things to — to look into. The crucial thing here is that a huge amount of refugees are in Turkey, in Lebanon, in Jordan, in the states that border — are adjacent to Syria. Mr. Putin: If we help — help them, the migratory pressure upon the European states will drop — will be decreased manyfold. And I believe it’s crucial from any point of view, from humanitarian point of view, from the point of view of — of helping people, helping the refugees and in general. I agree, I concur with President Trump, our military cooperate quite successfully together. They do get along and I hope they will be able to do so in future. And we will keep working in the Astana format — I mean Russia, Turkey and Iran, which I informed President Trump about. But we do stand ready to link this effort through the so-called small group of states so that the process would be a broader one, it would be a multidimensional one, and so that we will be able to maximize our fighting chance to get the ultimate success in the issue of Syria. And speaking about the — having the ball in our court in Syria, President Trump has just mentioned that we’ve successfully completed the World Football Cup. Speaking of the football actually, Mr. President, I’ll give this ball to you and now the ball is in your court. All the more that the United States will host the World Cup in 2026. Mr. Trump: Thank you very much. We do host it and we hope we do as good a job. That’s very nice. That will go to my son Barron. We have no question. In fact, Melania, here you go. (Laughter.) O.K. American aide: Final question from the United States will go to Jonathan Lemire from The A.P. Question : Thank you. A question for each president; President Trump, you first. Just now, President Putin denied having anything to do with the election interference in 2016. Every U.S. intelligence agency has concluded that Russia did. What — who — my first question for you, sir, is who do you believe? My second question is would you now, with the whole world watching, tell President Putin, would you denounce what happened in 2016 and would you warn him to never do it again? Mr. Trump: So let me just say that we have two thoughts. You have groups that are wondering why the F.B.I. never took the server — haven’t they taken the server. Why was the FBI told to leave the office of the Democratic National Committee? I’ve been wondering that, I’ve been asking that for months and months and I’ve been tweeting it out and calling it out on social media. Where is the server? I want to know where is the server and what is the server saying? With that being said, all I can do is ask the question. My people came to me, Dan Coats came to me and some others, they said they think it’s Russia. I have President Putin; he just said it’s not Russia. I will say this: I don’t see any reason why it would be. But I really do want to see the server. But I have — I have confidence in both parties. I — I really believe that this will probably go on for a while, but I don’t think it can go on without finding out what happened to the server. What happened to the servers of the Pakistani gentleman that worked on the D.N.C.? Where are those servers? They’re missing; where are they? What happened to Hillary Clinton’s e-mails? 33,000 e-mails gone — just gone. I think in Russia they wouldn’t be gone so easily. I think it’s a disgrace that we can’t get Hillary Clinton’s 33,000 e-mails. Mr. Trump: So I have great confidence in my intelligence people, but I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today. And what he did is an incredible offer. He offered to have the people working on the case come and work with their investigators with respect to the 12 people. I think that’s an incredible offer. O.K.? Thank you. Mr. Putin: Mr. President? Mr. Trump: Yes, please. Mr. Putin (through an interpreter): I’d like to add something to this. After all, I was an intelligence officer myself, and I do know how dossiers are made up. Just a — just a second. That’s the first thing. Now the second thing: I believe that Russia is a democratic state, and I hope you are not denying this right to your own country, you’re not denying that United States is a democracy. Do you believe United States is a democracy? And if so, if it is a democratic state, then the final conclusion in this kind of a dispute can only be delivered by a trial, by the court, not by the executive, by the law enforcement. For instance, the Concord company that was brought up is being accused, it’s been accused of interference. But this company does not constitute the Russian state. It does not represent the Russian state. And I brought several examples before. Well, you have a lot of individuals in the United States — take George Soros, for instance — with multibillion in capital, but does it make him — his position, his posture the posture of the United States? No, it does not. Well, it’s the same case. There is the issue of trying a case in the court, and the final — the — the final say is for the court to deliver. We are now talking about the private — the — the individuals, not about particular states. And as far as the most recent allegation is concerned, about the Russian intelligence officers, we do have an intergovernmental treaty. Please do send us the request. We will analyze it properly, and we’ll send a formal response. And as I said, we can extend this cooperation, but we should do it on a reciprocal basis, because we would await our Russian counterparts to provide us access to the persons of interest for us who — who we believe can have something to do with the intelligence services. Let’s discuss the specific issues, and not use the Russia and the U.S. relationship as a loose change — the loose change for this internal political struggle. Question : A question for President — for President Putin. Thank you. Two questions for you, sir. Can you tell me what President Trump may have indicated to you about officially recognizing Crimea as part of Russia? And then secondly, sir, do you, does the Russian government have any compromising material on President Trump or his family? (Laughter.) Mr. Putin (through an interpreter): President Trump and — well, posture of President Trump on Crimea is well known, and he stands firmly by it. He continued to maintain that it was illegal to annex it. Our viewpoint is different. We held a referendum in strict compliance with the U.N. charter and the international legislation. For us, this issue — we put paid to this issue. Mr. Putin (through an interpreter): And now, to the compromising material. Yeah, I did hear these rumors that we allegedly collected compromising material on Mr. Trump when he was visiting Moscow. Well, distinguished colleague, let me tell you this: When President Trump was at Moscow back then, I didn’t even know that he was in Moscow. I treat President Trump with utmost respect, but back then when he was a private individual, a businessman, nobody informed me that he was in Moscow. Well, let’s take St. Petersburg Economic Forum, for instance. There were over 500 American businessmen, high-ranking, high-level ones. I don’t even remember the last names of each and every one of them. Well, do you remember — do you think that we try to collect compromising material on each and every single one of them? Well, it’s difficult to imagine an utter nonsense of a bigger scale than this. Well, please, just disregard these issues and don’t think about this anymore again. Mr. Trump: It would have been out long ago. And if anybody watched Peter Strzok testify over the last couple of days — and I was in Brussels watching it — it was a disgrace to the F.B.I., it was a disgrace to our country, and you would say that was a total witch hunt. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. An earlier version of this transcript, prepared by the Federal News Service, omitted part of a question asked of President Vladimir V. Putin to which Mr. Putin replied, “Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because he talked about bringing the U.S.-Russia relationship back to normal.” The transcript now reflects his full question.

"Senate votes overwhelmingly to pass Iran nuclear bill","Major hurdle cleared for legislation that would grant Congress 30 days to to review Iran nuclear deal and pass a resolution of disapproval  Sabrina Siddiqui in Washington  Thu 7 May 2015 19.45 BST   Last modified on Fri 14 Jul 2017 22.10 BST   The US Senate on Thursday advanced legislation that would allow Congress to review a nuclear deal between world powers and Iran , clearing a major hurdle after weeks of Republican infighting threatened the bill’s passage. Senators overwhelmingly voted 98-1 in favor of the bill, with only Tom Cotton against its passage. Under the compromise, Congress would have 30 days to both review any nuclear accord with Iran and pass a resolution of disapproval. In the event that lawmakers passed such a resolution, Barack Obama would be unable to lift some of the congressional sanctions on Tehran. The fate of the bill had looked unclear in recent weeks, as a handful of senators pushed for votes on so-called “poison pill” amendments that would have revived a veto threat from the Obama administration. The Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio was particularly vocal in seeking a vote on his amendments – namely one that would require Iran to recognize Israel’s right to exist as a Jewish state – and last week teamed up with Cotton, a freshman Republican from Arkansas, to try to force a vote on the measure. Cotton has been one of the fiercest opponents of nuclear talks with Iran and spearheaded a controversial letter, signed by 47 Republicans, warning Iranian leadership that the next president could reverse any accord struck under Obama. Republican Bob Corker, the Tennessee senator who chairs the Senate foreign relations committee, and Maryland senator Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the panel, urged their colleagues to withhold from offering contentious amendments given the delicate nature of both the compromise and the broader talks with Iran. The bipartisan agreement was initially opposed by the White House, but following weeks of sensitive negotiations the Obama administration said the president would not veto the bill if it passed. Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, acknowledged the drama surrounding the sanctions bill while urging lawmakers to pass bill in its current form in a Senate floor speech on Thursday morning. The Kentucky Republican dubbed the bill “the best chance for our constituents, through the Congress they elect, to weigh in on the White House’s negotiations with Iran”. Negotiations between Iran and six world powers are ongoing, but a tentative framework announced last month marked a historic breakthrough. Under the provisional agreement, restrictions will be placed on Iran’s enrichment of nuclear material so that it cannot lead to atomic weapons. In exchange, the US and European Union will terminate all nuclear-related economic sanctions on Iran once the UN nuclear agency confirms that Iran has met its conditions. “If we didn’t face the threats of filibusters, or the blocking of amendments, or the specter of presidential vetoes, this bill would be a heck of a lot stronger. I assure you,” McConnell said. “But the truth is, we do. That’s the frustrating reality. The response to this should not be to give the American people no say at all on a deal with Iran.” Rubio expressed disappointment ahead of the vote that he was unable to get a vote on his amendments, which he said had left some senators “terrified”. “I am deeply disappointed by the direction this debate has taken,” said Rubio, who also sits on the foreign relations committee. He nonetheless added that he would support the passage of the bill."
"Europe finally pulls the trigger on a military force","If France and Germany are serious about an EU-wide army under a central command, they can thank Trump  Wed 21 Nov 2018 20.00 GMT   U S president Donald Trump is making an intolerable show of himself in Europe. Not only has he cast doubt on America’s commitment to mutual defence under Nato; he has also unilaterally withdrawn from the 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and the five permanent members of the UN security council, plus Germany and the European Union . Since then, the Trump administration has unilaterally imposed an embargo on goods deliveries to Iran from any third country, including the other signatories of the agreement. Foreign firms that continue to conduct business in Iran now face the threat of sanctions , and banks that process transactions risk losing access to the US financial system. Meanwhile, the US has been threatening similar action with respect to the new Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline that will run from Russia to Germany. The US Congress is considering legislation that allows the Trump administration to impose sanctions on European firms taking part in the project, even though these companies are contractually obliged to see the work through. And, according to Gerhard Schröder, a former German chancellor who now chairs the pipeline project, the US ambassador to Germany has been acting more like an “ occupation officer ” than a diplomat. All told, the Trump administration’s disruptive behaviour has left the French and German governments furious. But, beyond fuelling anger, Trump’s attacks on other countries’ sovereignty are adding momentum to a new push for European political unification. It is no secret that Europe is in the midst of an internal economic crisis – a result of the euro saddling southern eurozone countries with high inflation prior to the 2008 financial crash, which severely reduced their competitiveness within the euro system. These economic problems have led to the emergence of Eurosceptic nationalist parties and movements across the continent. More recently, the European project has been weakened further by the UK’s decision to withdraw from the EU. Against this backdrop, Trump’s actions are actually something of a godsend, because they have forced Europeans to accept that they must stand together in defence of their sovereignty and prosperity. A union of almost 450 million people (after Brexit) cannot allow a country two-thirds its size to treat it like a group of vassal states. Accordingly, both French president Emmanuel Macron and German chancellor Angela Merkel declared this month that they support the need to create a joint European army. The best way to understand this effort, said German minister of defence Ursula von der Leyen, is as an answer to Trump’s demand that Europeans spend more on defence. Of course, von der Leyen knows that the formation of an independent European force isn’t really what the US president had in mind. But the German establishment credibly maintains that a European army is meant to supplement and strengthen Nato. The transatlantic alliance will be no less necessary than it was before, nor will European citizens regard their American counterparts with any less sympathy and fellow feeling. The deep historical ties between the US and Europe remain unchanged; everybody knows there will be an America after Trump. Better yet, Europe is once again pursuing political unification with vigour and a sense of collective purpose, and that is how it should be. The European project has long suffered from giving economic integration pride of place while pushing political unification to the backburner. Indeed, France, Italy, the Benelux countries (Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg) and Germany had agreed to form a European army as early as 1952 under the Framework of the European Defence Community. But the French National Assembly never ratified that treaty, so it never entered into force. Then came the Maastricht treaty, which offered a second chance for a political union. Yet France stood in the way once again. The French supported euro membership, because they wanted the Mediterranean countries, including themselves, to be able to borrow at the same low rates as Germany on the capital markets. But they successfully resisted the creation of a political union, which is predicated on a central state with a joint army and monopoly on the use of military force. If France is now serious about merging national armies into a joint defence force under a central EU command – rather than just an intervention force for its former African colonies – Macron could well secure his place in the history books. There is much work to be done. But if it happens, he will have Trump to thank."
"Tensions Between Iran and Saudi Arabia Deepen Over Conflict in Yemen","Advertisement Supported by By  David D. Kirkpatrick CAIRO — Tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia deepened on Thursday as Iranian leaders lashed out with rare vehemence against the continuing Saudi air campaign in Yemen , even hurling personal insults at the young Saudi prince who is leading the fight. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader of Iran, on Thursday denounced the Saudi airstrikes in Yemen as “a crime” and “a genocide,” while all but taunting Saudi Arabia that its war in Yemen was doomed to fail. A regional coalition led by Saudi Arabia extended its bombing campaign for a 16th night in its effort to stop the Houthi movement and its allies from dominating Yemen. The Houthis nonetheless continued their advance, and aid groups warned of a compounding humanitarian catastrophe, particularly in the port city of Aden. Secretary of State John Kerry sharply warned Iran over its backing for the other side of the conflict in Yemen, in the first explicit American accusation that Tehran has been providing military aid to the Houthis. Washington was “not going to stand by while the region is destabilized,” Mr. Kerry said in an interview with “PBS NewsHour” on Wednesday night. “There are obviously supplies that have been coming from Iran,” he added. “There are a number of flights every single week that have been flying in. We trace those flights, and we know this. We are well aware of the support that Iran has been giving to Yemen.” The United States has recently increased the provision of logistical support, intelligence and weapons to the Saudi campaign, just days after the announcement of a framework for a nuclear deal with Iran. Mr. Kerry said he was seeking to reassure allies, including Saudi Arabia, that the United States could “do two things at the same time.” The United States could help push back against Iranian attempts to project its influence around the region, he argued, while at the same time negotiating a deal that would reward Tehran for providing guarantees that it was not building nuclear weapons . Saudi Arabia has said it is bombing the Houthis because it sees them as an instrument of Iranian power, but Western diplomats and independent experts have said that while Iran has supported the Houthis financially, it has no direct control over the group. The back-and-forth insults and threats Thursday raised fears that the Yemeni conflict could further inflame the rivalry between the two regional heavyweights, Iran and Saudi Arabia, already fighting each other through sectarian proxies in Syria and in less overt struggles across Iraq, Lebanon and Bahrain. Some analysts suggested that the battle for Yemen may further complicate the delicate politics of a deal with the Western powers to restrain Iran’s nuclear program . But others argued that the deal had instead emboldened Iran to flex its muscles against Saudi Arabia. “Deep down, the Iranians know that they are winning,” said Michael Stephens, the head of the Royal United Services Institute in Doha, Qatar. Mr. Kerry appeared forced into a difficult balance, reassuring Saudi Arabia and other allies of American support against Iran without antagonizing Iranian hard-liners severely enough to fuel opposition to the nuclear deal. The Ayatollah’s diatribe only added to the challenge. In rare direct criticism of Iran’s rival by name, Ayatollah Khamenei said that Saudi Arabia was departing from a history of acting with dignity in foreign affairs, saying that “inexperienced youths have taken over the affairs of the state and are replacing dignity with barbarity.” His comments were a jab at the Saudi defense minister, Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who Saudi diplomats say is about 30. He is also a son of King Salman, who ascended to the throne this year and promptly named him to the powerful dual roles of defense minister and chief of the royal court. The Saudi news media has been cheering Prince Mohamed as the architect and overseer of the Yemeni campaign despite a light résumé, raising eyebrows among rivals in the royal family and setting him up for embarrassment if it is deemed to have failed. In a statement on Thursday, Ayatollah Khamenei warned the Saudis “they must cease their crimes in Yemen,” and that failure there was all but inevitable. “They will be harmed and incur losses in this issue in which they will under no circumstances triumph. The Saudis’ face will be rubbed in the ground in Yemen,” he said, comparing the Saudi actions to Israel’s campaigns against Palestinian militants in Gaza — who have also received support from Iran. In another statement, released over Twitter along with some of his other remarks, the ayatollah further teased Saudi Arabia about its pledge to catch up to Iran in the development of a nuclear weapon. “An underdeveloped country said that ‘If Iran has enrichment, we want it too,’ ” he said. “Well, do it if you can. Nuclear technology is our domestic capability.” Mr. Stephens, of the Royal United Services Institute, said the extraordinary barbed comments appeared designed to provoke and inflame. Annotated maps showing the Houthi rebels’ drive south, U.S. airstrikes and historical divisions. “It is almost like the Iranians are baiting the Saudis, trying to find every pressure point, to make the Saudis feel emasculated, and then stand back and watch as the Saudis get in deeper and deeper,” he said. But at the same time, he argued, the Iranians were sending a message of support to their Yemeni allies, the Houthis. “They have decided to show that they are willing to stand behind the Houthis,” Mr. Stephens said. “The Iranians are making some sort of a guarantee to their allies that, whatever happens, they are going to make sure that the Houthis are at the table for the talks.” Saudi Arabia, which is leading a regional coalition against the Houthis, issued its own warning to Iran, saying that two Iranian warships that recently arrived in the waters off Yemen should steer clear of Yemeni waters. “If the ships seek to aid the Houthis, the coalition has the right to choose the proper answer,” said a spokesman, Brig. Gen. Ahmad Asseri. In another provocation, Saudi Arabia denied permission for an Iranian plane filled with pilgrims to land in Mecca. The Houthis, a group based in northern Yemen that follows a strain of Shiite Islam, have fought a half dozen conflicts with the Yemeni government since 2004, including a fight in 2009 that drew Saudi Arabia into border skirmishes. Only since that time, scholars say, has the movement received support from Iran, the region’s main Shiite Muslim power as well as Saudi Arabia’s rival. Since the fall, however, the Houthis have teamed with major units of the Yemeni security forces still loyal to the former strongman, Ali Abdullah Saleh. Those units have helped the Houthi-allied forces capture the capital, Sana, and much of Yemen. Their advance appears to have continued despite the two-week-old Saudi bombing campaign. On Thursday, Al Jazeera television network — owned by Qatar, part of the Saudi coalition — said the Houthi-allied forces had also occupied Ataq, capital of Shabwa Province, taking control of government offices. At the United Nations, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, whose efforts to restart a political dialogue in Yemen have collapsed, implored the Houthis to halt their expansion. But he also has been critical of the Saudi-led military campaign. “The coalition air raids — and the continuing attempts by the Houthis and their allied armed groups to expand their power — have turned an internal political crisis into a violent conflict that risks deep and long-lasting regional repercussions,” Mr. Ban said at United Nations headquarters. “The last thing the region and our world need is more of the chaos and crimes we have seen in Libya and Syria,” he said.

"Saudi Crown Prince Likens Iran’s Supreme Leader to Hitler","Advertisement Supported by By  Ben Hubbard BEIRUT, Lebanon — Saudi Arabia’s powerful crown prince has compared the supreme leader of Iran to Adolf Hitler, and said that his country would acquire a nuclear bomb “as soon as possible” if Iran developed nuclear weapons. The comments by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ratcheted up the rhetoric in the increasingly volatile rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran, which has fueled sectarianism and war across the Middle East. His statements were in an excerpt, released on Thursday, of a prerecorded interview with “60 Minutes,” the CBS News program. Iran’s Foreign Ministry responded by calling the prince a delusional and devious novice who “has no idea of politics.” Saudi Arabia, a Sunni monarchy, blames Iran for funding militias to undermine Arab states, while Shiite Iran accuses Saudi Arabia of backing Sunni extremist groups. Their struggle for regional dominance has put the two nations on opposite sides of conflicts in Yemen, Syria and Iraq that have killed hundreds of thousands of people and displaced millions. Prince Mohammed, who jailed hundreds of the kingdom’s most potent figures while swiftly consolidating his own power, is scheduled to arrive in the United States on Monday for an extended trip. His plans include meeting with President Trump in the White House and with business, entertainment and technology leaders in a number of American cities. One of his primary goals is to persuade Americans to invest in his reform plans, which aim to diversify the Saudi economy away from oil, increase the kingdom’s military self-sufficiency and raise its citizens’ quality of life. His comments on Iran also suggested that he would seek further cooperation with the United States in combating Iranian influence in the Middle East, a goal he shares with the Trump administration. In the interview, Prince Mohammed, 32, played down Iran’s power, saying its army was not well ranked in the Muslim world and that Saudi Arabia had a larger economy. “Iran is far from being equal to Saudi Arabia,” he said, speaking through a translator. When asked about his previous comments comparing Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader of Iran, to Hitler, he replied, “Absolutely.” “He wants to create his own project in the Middle East very much like Hitler, who wanted to expand at the time,” Prince Mohammed said. “Many countries around the world and in Europe did not realize how dangerous Hitler was until what happened, happened. I don’t want to see the same events happening in the Middle East.” He was then asked whether Saudi Arabia sought nuclear weapons to counter Iran. “Saudi Arabia does not want to acquire any nuclear bomb, but without a doubt if Iran developed a nuclear bomb, we will follow suit as soon as possible,” he said. Reacting to the prince’s remarks, the Iran Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi was quoted by state media as saying they “do not deserve a response because he is a delusional naïve person who never talks but with lies and bitterness and has no idea of politics, but to use untimely strong words due to lack of foresight.” Saudi officials grew furious with the Obama administration for its push with other world powers to reach an agreement placing limits on Iran’s nuclear capabilities. Like Israeli leaders and many Republicans in the United States, they claimed that the agreement would merely delay Iran’s quest for nuclear weapons, while ignoring Iran’s other activities, like supporting Shiite militias. Iran has insisted that its nuclear program was peaceful and intended to produce only energy and research, not weapons. Saudi Arabia has not been known to seek nuclear weapons, but its cabinet this week approved a policy for a new atomic energy program. The new policy stated that “all nuclear activities will be restricted to peaceful purposes, within the framework defined by international legislations, treaties and conventions,” according to a statement released by the government on Wednesday. It remained unclear when work on the new program would begin. The “60 Minutes” interview with Prince Mohammed will be broadcast on Sunday. Rick Gladstone contributed reporting from New York.

"Post-Deal Iran Asks if U.S. Is Still ‘Great Satan,’ or Something Less","Advertisement Supported by By  Thomas Erdbrink TEHRAN — A new struggle is unfolding in Iran, where the top leaders have begun to tackle the question of how to deal with the United States after having reached a nuclear agreement with their great enemy. The supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , and President Hassan Rouhani have been offering starkly opposing visions of Iran’s post-deal future, reflecting their divergent attitudes toward the “Great Satan.” “We have announced that we will not negotiate with the Americans on any issue other than the nuclear case,” Mr. Khamenei said this month. Speaking to a group of hard-line students recently he was even more explicit, telling them to “prepare for the continuation of the fight against America.” By contrast, Mr. Rouhani said on Sunday that the nuclear agreement, reached after two years of tortuous negotiations, was “not the end of the way,” but “a beginning for creating an atmosphere of friendship and cooperation with various countries.” How the opposing visions are ultimately resolved may be uncertain, but as the nuclear pact is carried out and the sanctions are lifted, Iran’s favorite scapegoat can no longer plausibly be regarded as the root of all evil in the world. “Our Great Satan without sanctions is just not the same anymore,” said Saeed Laylaz, an economist and supporter of Mr. Rouhani. “Perhaps we should use ‘lesser Satan’ now or something like that.” In a highly controlled society like Iran, the leaders rarely speak spontaneously, so there is a certain premeditated “good cop, bad cop” aspect to the public posturing about the United States. But the dueling perspectives also reflect the problem of fitting the new, softer image of the United States into Iran’s founding ideological narrative. Thirty-seven years after the revolution, those longing for Iran to have normal relations with the world, believe their time has finally come, no matter what the supreme leader is saying. By their lights, change is inevitable, and Ayatollah Khamenei is just protecting his political flank against the hard-line clerics and commanders who oppose the nuclear deal.  But other analysts say that misreads the situation, putting a naïvely optimistic spin on the motivations and intentions of an all-powerful supreme leader who, while cautious and calculating, remains a highly conservative force. There are no outward indications that Mr. Khamenei is enthusiastic about rapprochement between Iran and the United States, these other analysts say. On the contrary, since August he has used every public speech to make clear that there will be no such thing, repeating last week that, deal or no deal, the United States remains the “Great Satan.” “This deal is a one-off agreement in our interest,” said Hamidreza Taraghi, a hard-line analyst close to Ayatollah Khamenei. “Not an attempt to mend ties with America.” Iran’s leader, they add, is a staunch ideologue who often says that he is “not a diplomat but a revolutionary,” and the flexibility he has shown on the nuclear issue was out of self-interest, a calculated tactic to get sanctions lifted, not the start of a new era for Iran. To underline his point, he predicted last week that Israel would not exist in 25 years, drawing international criticism. There will be no such thing as direct talks over other issues, like Iraq, Syria and Yemen. At best, some analysts say, Ayatollah Khamenei is awaiting what he calls in some speeches “positive steps” from the United States. He will “review” such actions before considering real relations. “If they do not leave the region and keep Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in power, the leader doesn’t see any future in having relations with America,” said one former Revolutionary Guards official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of his position, adding, “For now, that does not seem likely to happen.” Whatever the effect on foreign relations, Ayatollah Khamenei’s genuine distrust of the United States is casting an increasingly dark shadow over Mr. Rouhani’s ambitions at home, which are always subject to a veto by the supreme leader, who retains the final word on all matters. Over the past two years, the president, who came to power promising an end to Iran’s international isolation and a more “normal” life, has raised expectations among Iran’s middle class. He has done so while tiptoeing around the subject of establishing relations with the United States, which has become a symbol of the changes many people would like to see, such as more personal freedom and overhauling the archaic justice system. Right after the nuclear agreement was signed, for example, some in Tehran called for abolishing the “death to America” slogan and predicted the reopening of the United States Embassy. Neither suggestion gained traction. Now, in line with Ayatollah Khamenei’s recent remarks, the winds seem to be shifting. Night after night, state television features remarks by American politicians and Republican presidential candidates bashing the deal. Often, these are followed by I-told-you-so clips from Ayatollah Khamenei, saying “America cannot be trusted.” Mr. Rouhani’s supporters are taking note. “First, I predicted that direct flights between Tehran and New York would start in some weeks,” said Mohammad Javad Mehreghan, a financial expert. “We were overwhelmed with joy. Now, I realize it will take years. This country won’t change overnight.” Many say Mr. Rouhani should be content with having prevented war over Iran’s nuclear program , unfrozen the country’s assets and opened the door to foreign investment. “That has all along been the real mandate given to the president,” said Nader Karimi Joni, a pro-government journalist. “People who thought otherwise have been fooling themselves.” But the president is persevering, promising better relations with the West, a better economy and more personal freedom. To the trained Iranian ear, when Mr. Rouhani talks about more cooperation with “various countries,” he means the United States. Despite Ayatollah Khamenei’s hard line in public, however, most Iranians and some well-connected analysts say that he is more on Mr. Rouhani’s side than he lets on, and is merely hedging his bets in case something goes wrong. Otherwise, they say, why would he agree to a nuclear deal at all? “In the end even the supreme leader wants to have better relations with America,” said Farshad Ghorbanpour, a political analyst close to the government. “But he is angry over the bad remarks coming out of the United States, so he wants to wait if the deal works before he allows relations to get better.” It was Ayatollah Khamenei himself who drew up the framework for talking to the United States on the nuclear issue. He allowed direct negotiations to take place only through a trusted foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif. Iran’s original goal for the talks was not to solve problems with the United States, but to get sanctions lifted. There was only one glitch in Ayatollah Khamenei’s carefully planned strategy, when in 2013 an overly enthusiastic Mr. Rouhani accepted a phone call from President Obama . While the conversation created considerable excitement in the West, it did not go over well in Iran. Upon arrival in Tehran, Mr. Rouhani was pelted by hard-liners with eggs and a shoe. Some Iranian reformist newspapers are predicting hopefully that Mr. Rouhani will meet Mr. Obama at the United Nations General Assembly this month. In contrast, last week a Friday Prayer leader said that Mr. Zarif had been told — for the time being at least — to cease any direct negotiations with the United States, though people close to Mr. Zarif deny this. Many, perhaps most, Iranians — having had their hopes for change dashed numerous times in the past, most recently in 2009 — have few expectations that the nuclear agreement will fundamentally change anything. “The deal will absolutely happen,” said Mr. Karimi Joni, the journalist. But there will be no opening of embassies, direct flights to New York or American investments here, he predicted. “Unless the supreme leader thinks this is necessary for the continuation of the system. In that case it will happen immediately.” Others are not so sure, convinced that relations with the United States have been permanently altered, despite the supreme leader’s pronouncements. “Whatever anybody says, America is less of an enemy and less hostile than it was before,” said Ghasem Golbaf, the owner and publisher of several magazines. “The relation will change for the better. It’s just inevitable.” Advertisement"
"George W. Bush Helped Put U.S. on Path to Talks With Iran","Republicans have been criticizing President Obamaâs nuclear deal with Iran, but those with longer memories recall that it was one of their own who set the United States on the path toward negotiations. Nine years ago, President George W. Bush agreed to join Europeans at the negotiating table with Iran. At the time , the conditions were that Iran must suspend uranium activities for talks to engage about halting its nuclear program in exchange for economic and political benefits. âItâs conceptually a deep irony because this diplomatic outreach was originally designed and engineered by President Bush,â said Philip Zelikow, a University of Virginia professor who was a deputy to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in Mr. Bushâs administration. âItâs convenient for Republicans and Democrats to forget this.â Mr. Zelikow said that there was intense debate within the Bush administration at the time over whether to engage Iran and that ultimately talks failed when its leadership had a change of heart. Itâs hard to know how Mr. Bush would have handled this round of negotiations with Iran, Mr. Zelikow surmised, because Iranâs nuclear capabilities have progressed since the previous administration. Stephen Hadley, a former foreign policy adviser to Mr. Bush, said that he thinks the Bush administration would have been wary of allowing Iran to retain the ability to enrich uranium, as the current deal does, but that perhaps a symbolic amount might have been allowed in the final negotiations. But, he said, looking past Iranâs other misdeeds would have been a problem. âPeople say how can you negotiate with the Iranians on the nuclear issue and not on the other things theyâre doing,â Mr. Hadley said, alluding to, among other things, its support of groups like Hezbollah. âIâm confident that the Bush administration would have done something to find a broader framework to deal with Iranâs negative activities.â One former adviser to Mr. Bush was less confident in how he would have handled the situation. John Bolton, the foreign policy hawk who was his ambassador to the United Nations, said the pressure to get something done might have made such a deal move forward. âI donât know, I would have to worry about the constant dripping of water on a stone from the State Department and the Europeans wanting to negotiate,â said Mr. Bolton, who remains steadfast that engagement with Iran is a bad idea. âItâs a dark day for the republic, I must say.â First Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

"Trump’s Negotiating Playbook Faced Test in North Korea","Advertisement Supported by News Analysis By  David E. Sanger WASHINGTON — President Trump attempted a revolutionary approach to North Korea — a gamble that negotiating prowess and deal-making charm in a face-to-face meeting with Kim Jong-un could accomplish what no American president or diplomat had dared to attempt in the 65 years since an uneasy armistice settled over the Korean Peninsula. It was a bold and innovative approach, and one worth trying, to take on the related goals of a peace treaty and eradicating the North’s now-substantial nuclear arsenal. The fact that it fell on Thursday before getting out of the starting gate, though, underscored how little the two men understood about each other, or how their words and maximalist demands were resonating in Washington and Pyongyang. Mr. Trump approached Mr. Kim, the North Korean leader, as if he were a competing property developer haggling over a prized asset — and assumed that, in the end, Mr. Kim would be willing to give it all up for the promise of future prosperity. So he started with threats of “fire and fury,” then turned to surprise initiatives, then gratuitous flattery of one of the world’s more brutal dictators. “He will be safe, he will be happy, his country will be rich,” Mr. Trump said of the North Korean leader on Tuesday, as he met again with Moon Jae-in , the over-optimistic South Korean president whose national security adviser predicted, that same day, it was “99.9 percent” sure that the summit meeting in Singapore would go ahead. But it was already becoming clear to Mr. Trump and his team that the techniques involved in negotiating real estate do not translate easily into negotiations over nuclear weapons. Mr. Kim needs money, investment and technology, for sure. But more than that, he needs to convince North Korea’s elites that he has not traded away the only form of security in his sole control — the nuclear patrimony of his father and his grandfather. “For them, ‘getting rich’ is a secondary consideration,” said William Perry, the former secretary of defense and one of the last people to negotiate with the North over peace treaties, nuclear disarmament and missiles — in 1999, when he was sent out as President Bill Clinton’s special envoy. “If I learned anything dealing with them, it’s that their security is pre-eminent. They know we have the capability to defeat them, and they believe we have the intent to do so.” “And the only way to address that,” Mr. Perry, now 90, said this week in Palo Alto, Calif., as the North Koreans were issuing their latest threats, “is with a step-by-step process, exactly the approach Trump said he did not want to take.” Other complications prevented the talks from making it far enough to even discuss those issues. As the two leaders circled each other over what long-range goals they would agree to in Singapore, it became increasingly clear there were forces at work in both capitals that had a strong interest in failure. The creators of North Korea’s nuclear and missile forces are the country’s true elite, celebrated as the heroes who keep America at bay. To lose their arsenal is to lose their status and influence. When Mr. Trump sent one of his deputy national security advisers to Singapore a week ago for a prearranged meeting to work out meeting logistics, the North Koreans stood him up. In the past week, they did not answer the phone, a senior administration official told reporters on Thursday afternoon. The North has its own list of complaints. After Mr. Trump accepted Mr. Kim’s offer to meet face-to-face, he replaced his national security adviser with John R. Bolton, who just a few months ago published an essay titled “The Legal Case for Striking North Korea First,” an ode to pre-empting Pyongyang — no matter what it promised about the future. Once he ensconced himself in the West Wing, Mr. Bolton began talking publicly about the “Libyan model” of turning over nuclear weapons, a reference to a deal he helped design in 2003 in which Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi turned over a nascent nuclear program in return for exactly the kinds of economic lures Mr. Trump was talking about. To the North Koreans, Mr. Bolton knew, the Libya example was shorthand for making a bad decision to unilaterally disarm. They have little doubt that if North Korean citizens rose to overthrow their government — as Libyan rebels did against Colonel Qaddafi in 2011 — Washington would be more than happy to help chase down the leadership. None of this means the initiatives with North Korea are entirely dead. Mr. Trump carefully left open the door for Mr. Kim to “call me or write” if he decides to cease the threats of nuclear exchanges and wants to reschedule the summit meeting. But Mr. Trump also on Thursday could not resist echoing his Twitter post months ago about the size of the nuclear button on his desk: The United States’ nuclear abilities “are so massive and powerful” that he should never be tempted to reach for them. It may have been intended to intimidate. But it seems more likely to spur Mr. Kim to new demonstrations of his own abilities to reach American cities with North Korean missiles. In fact, the question about North Korea now is the same question that Washington is asking about Iran: What is their next chess move? Are they likely to escalate? For now, the Iranians have indicated they are taking it slow. But history suggests that North Korea’s reaction to the end of negotiations is almost always to create a crisis — and see if that, in turn, forces the United States back to the table. When the “Agreed Framework” with the Clinton administration collapsed — in part because of North Korean cheating, in part because of the United States’ lack of interest in moving toward reconciliation — Mr. Kim’s father moved to the country’s first nuclear tests. When accords were scuttled at the end of the George W. Bush administration, the North tested a new president, Barack Obama, with a series of larger nuclear tests and then a race to build intercontinental missiles. Even before he came to office, Mr. Trump complained — accurately — that the incremental approaches pursued by his predecessors had failed. He inherited a North Korea that had exploited the United States’ distraction during Iraq, Afghanistan and the Iran negotiations, and managed to build 20 to 60 nuclear weapons. The North had paid almost no price. So Mr. Trump did what he learned to do in the New York real estate market: Make maximalist demands, inflict pain and then begin a negotiation. But his “fire and fury” approach resulted in reactions he had never seen in the private market. Mr. Moon became so concerned that a new, famously volatile American president could trip into a war on the Korean Peninsula that he raced to wrap Mr. Trump into a negotiation that would make it difficult for the United States to launch the kind of pre-emptive attack Mr. Bolton had advocated. Mr. Moon then showered Mr. Trump with effusive praise, even to the point of endorsing the premature talk about Nobel Peace Prizes. “Moon’s role is what is entirely new this time,” Mr. Perry noted, hours before the meeting planning fell apart. The South Korean president saw himself as the essential go-between, the central player in coaxing both sides back on track when moments of crisis — like this one — arise. Now comes the test of his peacemaking skills. “The denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and building a permanent peace on the peninsula is a task we cannot give up or delay,” Mr. Moon said in Seoul on Thursday, calling the cancellation of the summit meeting “disconcerting and very regrettable.” He urged Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim to talk directly. Mr. Moon’s task is to rebuild what fell apart. But first there must be a diagnosis of what went wrong. Overheated language on both sides — including unsubtle reminders of each country’s willingness to wipe the other off the map — was part of it. But that was an occasional feature of the Cold War, too. The bigger problem was that the United States and North Korea were never on the same page about what the objective of the negotiation should be. Mr. Trump, Mr. Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had one vision: what they called “complete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearization.” But it was a one-sided affair — never once did they raise the likelihood that the United States would have to give something up, too. Mr. Kim used the phrase “denuclearization” as well, but he seemed to be discussing something more like arms control. He was willing to give up part of the arsenal, but only as the United States pulled back its troops in South Korea and gradually surrendered its ability to threaten the North. Mr. Trump, of course, talked about the North giving up all of its weapons in one fell swoop — before allowing, just in the past few days, that he might be willing to try a more gradual approach. But that was probably too late. “Zero warheads was never going to be on the table,” said Robert S. Litwak, a senior vice president of the Wilson Center for International Scholars, who wrote a detailed study of how to deal, gradually, with defanging the North Korean threat. He said Mr. Trump needs to move to something closer to the 2015 Iranian deal, which constrained but did not eliminate Tehran’s nuclear abilities. That, of course, is the deal Mr. Trump  walked away from a few weeks ago, meaning that he now has two nuclear crises on his hands at once. Advertisement"
"In Reprieve to Obama, Senate Democrats Agree to Wait on Iran Sanctions","Advertisement Supported by By  David E. Sanger WASHINGTON — Ten Senate Democrats who have advocated putting more sanctions on Iran gave the White House a two-month reprieve on Tuesday, saying they would wait until after the late-March deadline for completing the outlines of a deal to restrain Tehran’s nuclear program before voting for a bill that President Obama has said would undermine any chance of reaching an agreement. The concession came in a letter to Mr. Obama from Senator Robert Menendez, the ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, who has been increasingly at odds with the White House for his strong advocacy of a bill intended to squeeze Iran’s oil revenues even harder if the nuclear negotiations do not result in an agreement. But Mr. Menendez’s letter made clear that he and the other Democrats would join Senate Republicans if a meaningful accord was not reached by March 24. While Secretary of State John Kerry has expressed optimism that an extension agreed upon in November would lead to a speedy agreement, talks have been largely stalemated since then, and few of Mr. Kerry’s aides now believe that deadline can be met. The ultimate deadline for the talks is the end of June, by which time the two countries are supposed to develop a detailed accord. Mr. Menendez wrote in the letter that he and the other senators “remain deeply skeptical that Iran is committed to making the concessions required to demonstrate to the world that its nuclear program is exclusively peaceful by March 24.” But he said that in deference to Mr. Obama’s fears that any new sanctions would undermine negotiations, “we will only vote for this legislation on the Senate floor if Iran fails to reach agreement on a political framework that addresses all parameters of a comprehensive agreement.” “This deadline is the critical test of Iranian intentions,” the senator said. Other senators signing the letter included Charles E. Schumer of New York, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, usually close allies of the president. The offer to Mr. Obama is double-edged, because it greatly reduces the chances that he can win another extension of the negotiations while keeping many of the current restrictions on Iran’s program in place. Until now, some of Mr. Obama’s current and former advisers on the Iran issue, perhaps the biggest single potential foreign policy breakthrough of his last two years in office, have argued privately that “managed irresolution” of the problem would be preferable to a breakdown in talks that could lead to a military standoff. At least some influential Republicans seemed willing to go along with the delay, sensing that an alliance with Senate Democrats could ultimately give them more leverage over the shape of a final agreement, if there is one. Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, the new chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and a proponent of new sanctions, said, “The last thing we need to do is pass a bill out of the U.S. Senate that is not veto-proof.” The letter came on the same day as congressional Republicans held two hearings about the usefulness of additional sanctions as they sought ways to hem in Mr. Obama’s team of negotiators. As part of that effort, they also found some unintended allies 6,000 miles away. Whether Iran is racing toward nuclear weapon capabilities is one of the most contentious foreign-policy issues challenging the West. In recent days, conservatives in the Iranian Parliament have said they are working on a resolution of their own to counter American pressure by binding the hands of Iran’s negotiating team and stopping them from agreeing to production limits on nuclear fuel. Like many in Congress, they would be happy to see the current negotiations collapse. In fact, their proposals would require Tehran to deploy centrifuges that can enrich uranium far more efficiently than ever. The result of the competing resolutions in Washington and Tehran is what amounts to an international game of chicken. Each country is taunting the other to become the first to violate the terms of a 2013 pact that established the conditions under which the nuclear talks would take place. It prohibits the West from imposing new sanctions during the talks and bars Iran from improving its enrichment or bomb-making abilities. “Congress is trying to force the administration to adopt a harder line in the negotiations,” said Edward Levine, a former senior staff member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The Iranians, he said, “are trying something similar.” In recent days, Iran’s chief negotiator, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, was ordered to explain why he took a stroll through Geneva with Mr. Kerry on Jan. 14. Iranian hard-liners suspect that Mr. Zarif — a former academic who was educated in the United States — wants a deal a bit too much. Influential Republicans, and a few Democrats, have said the same of Mr. Kerry and Mr. Obama. Some of the experts who testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Tuesday said they did not accept the claim that new sanctions would undercut any chance to strike a deal. “These would only come into effect if Iran cheats, or doesn’t make a deal,” one of the witnesses, Eric S. Edelman, the under secretary of defense in the Bush administration, said in an interview. “I’m skeptical of the argument that unless we do something for Iran, it will walk away from the table. My view is that if the supreme leader wants a deal, there will be a deal.” The supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has publicly expressed doubts of his own , even as he has given his negotiators room to explore the possibilities. He warned Iranians this month to prepare anew for a “resistance economy.” His comments suggested that he was bracing the public for more economic pain brought about both by sanctions and the rapid drop in oil prices , which has done more to break Iran’s budget than any penalty imposed by the West. The Iranian threat to resume high-level enrichment, which would shorten the time it would take to build a bomb, was clearly intended by military leaders and other hard-liners as a signal to Mr. Zarif. He must come back, they are saying, with a deal that ensures Iran’s ability to hold on to much of its nuclear infrastructure — and thus the capacity to assemble a weapon if its leadership decides it needs one.

"Billboards in Iran Say ‘Death to America,’ but Officials Say ‘Let’s Make a Deal’","Advertisement Supported by Tehran Journal By  Thomas Erdbrink TEHRAN — Wearing business suits set off with sneakers, the American executives trailed a young guide along the narrow sidewalks of the capital of Iran, once branded by the United States as part of the “Axis of Evil.” Their destination was one of Tehran’s most luxurious restaurants, where Iranian officials and business consultants greeted the visitors with open arms and the Pharrell Williams song “Happy” blasted from the sound system. “Everybody loves us here,” said Ned Lamont, a digital services entrepreneur and former politician, holding a glass of carrot juice offered by one of his hosts. Just as the Obama administration and Congress were wrangling over details of a nuclear agreement with Iran last week, the group of 24 executives were touring the country on a fact-finding mission. Of course, the organizers rushed to explain, this was by no means a business delegation. “We are tourists,” said Dick Simon, a member of the Young Presidents’ Organization, a network of business executives. “But naturally many in our company have the potential of getting involved here, as they lead some very significant businesses,” he said, referring to his fellow travelers. American companies are barred from doing business in Iran, which remains under a regimen of sanctions aimed at pressuring the country to curtail its nuclear program . The sanctions, which cover financial transactions as well as a host of industries like petroleum and shipping, have put a stranglehold on the Iranian economy, which is struggling with inflation and shortages of food and consumer goods. With the United States and Iran currently negotiating a nuclear deal under which those sanctions would eventually be lifted, some American companies are now hoping for new business opportunities in a country that has long been off limits. The visit to Iran by the American group, which included venture capitalists and business executives from a range of industries, including real estate, health care and insurance, was organized by individual members of the Young Presidents’ Organization. Last week’s trip was the group’s third to the Islamic republic. A guide to help you navigate the deal between global powers and Tehran. “There was a waiting list. The prospect of a changing Iran is very interesting,” Mr. Simon said. At the function Thursday night, the delegates sat at tables decorated with cards marked with topics of conversation: “Real Estate,” “Diplomacy,” “Luxury” and “ICT,” for information and communications technology. The women in the group wore head scarves, as is obligatory in Iran. “I should be at ‘ICT,’ I think,” said Mr. Lamont, whose Connecticut-based company provides video and data services to college campuses, “but I think the ‘Diplomacy’ table will be more interesting for now.” Mr. Lamont and the others in the group arrived in Tehran last week after touring ancient sites near Shiraz, a city in the south, under the watchful eyes of government minders. “They don’t want us to get in any sorts of trouble, or have an incident, but we have been mostly free to go around,” said Mr. Lamont, who like other members of the group was bubbling with enthusiasm over the hospitality of their Iranian hosts. In the Shiite holy city of Qum, the group sat down with a reform-minded ayatollah who told them that Iran was on the verge of major change. “I asked, what about the ‘Death to America’ slogan?” Mr. Lamont said, referring to the phrase that appears on many banners across the country and has long been shouted at public demonstrations. But the cleric responded that the slogan was from a different era. “He told us, ‘This is the new Iran,’ ” Mr. Lamont said. “Such messages are hopeful and different.” At the restaurant on Thursday, Cyrus Razzaghi, a prominent Iranian business consultant, and other speakers extolled the potential of the Iranian economy for adventurous American investors. “In the end these are not normal tourists of course, they are wealthy, powerful and influential Americans,” Mr. Razzaghi said. “Besides from giving them a taste of Iranian culture, I felt they would also be interested in Iran’s huge market.” Iran’s deputy minister of telecommunications, Nasrollah Jahangard, peppered the audience with statistics, saying Iran was one of the most connected countries in the region. “The number of smartphones is expected to be doubled to 40 million on a population of nearly 80 million,” he said. “We have 3G running and 4G networks under development; we are moving forward fast,” Mr. Jahangard said in English. His words seemed to pique the interest of some of the executives. Christopher Schroeder, a venture capitalist, said he saw some promise in the country’s technology sector. “I have met with young women who are running Iran’s versions of Amazon and Groupon. They could really get somewhere in the future.” However, it was clear from the questions about the economy and the influence of hard-liners that many obstacles remain. “When I look out of that window,” said Richard Cohen, a New York-based real estate developer, pointing at the Tehran skyline, “I see 18 cranes. Only one is working. I have never seen so many unfinished high-rises in my life. What does that symbolize?” Since 1995, sanctions have barred Americans from doing business in Iran, where a substantial middle class represents a potentially lucrative market for foreign companies. Hopes that the nuclear framework agreement made on April 2 might lead to a broader deal by the end of June have raised expectations of an opening of the Iranian market. Still, most companies are waiting for a final deal before seriously considering investing here. “Fact is, now we are not even allowed to,” Mr. Simon said. Despite the recent talks between Iran and the United States and the prospect of better relations, Iran’s revolutionary ardor was still visible. In Shiraz, at the tomb of King Cyrus, a major tourist destination, the group passed a billboard bearing a quote by Iran’s first supreme leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. “The world should know that all Iran and Muslims’ problems are due to the politics of aliens and of the USA. Muslims generally hate aliens and specially the USA,” it reads in English. The executives, however, said they were struck by the warm reception they had received in Iran. “All in all it seems to me the Iranians really want to reconnect with the world,” said Jennifer Adams Baldock, a former executive in the printing industry. “They want to move on.” Because of an editing error, the Tehran Journal article on Monday, about a visit to Iran by American executives who hope the lifting of economic sanctions will open up business opportunities there, misstated the role of one of the visitors, Dick Simon, in the Young Presidents’ Organization, a business network whose members organized the trip. Mr. Simon is a member of the group, not a co-founder. Advertisement"
"The Trump Doctrine","Advertisement Supported by By  Thomas L. Friedman Well, it took almost a year, but we now have the “Trump Doctrine.” It’s very simple. And, as you’d expect, it fits neatly into a tweet. On nearly every major issue, President Trump’s position is: “Obama built it. I broke it. You fix it.” And that cuts right to the core of what is the most frightening thing about the Trump presidency. It’s not the president’s juvenile tweeting or all the aides who’ve been pushed out of his clown car at high speed or his industrial-strength lying. It’s Trump’s willingness to unravel so many longstanding policies and institutions at once — from Nafta to Obamacare to the global climate accord to the domestic clean power initiative to the Pacific trade deal to the Iran nuclear deal — without any real preparation either on the day before or for the morning after. Indeed, Trump has made most of his climate, health, energy and economic decisions without consulting any scientists, without inviting into the White House a broad range of experts, without putting forth his own clear-cut alternatives to the systems he’s unraveling, without having at the ready a team of aides or a political coalition able to implement any alternatives and without a strategic framework that connects all of his dots. In short, we’re simply supposed to take the president’s word that this or that deal “is the worst deal ever” — backed up by no serious argument or plan about how he will produce a better one. I’m open to improving any of these accords or institutions. I’m even open to the possibility that by just tipping over all these accords at once, and throwing away his steering wheel, Trump will get people to improve the Iran deal or Obamacare out of sheer panic at the chaos that might ensue if they don’t. But I am equally open to the possibility that unraveling all of these big systems at once — health, energy, geopolitics — without a clear plan or a capable team will set in motion chain reactions, some of them long term, that Trump has not thought through in the least. Moreover, when you break big systems, which, albeit imperfectly, have stabilized regions, environments or industries for decades, it can be very difficult to restore them. Question: We’re told by our secretary of state that he’s been engaged in some secret contacts with North Korea, exploring the possibility of a diplomatic solution that might dramatically reduce North Korea’s nuclear arsenal in return for U.S. promises of regime security. If, at the same time, Trump unilaterally pulls out of the deal we’ve already signed with Iran to prevent it from developing nukes — and Trump moves to reimpose sanctions — how does that not send only one message to the North Koreans: No deal with the U.S. is worth the paper it’s written on, so you’d be wise to hold on to all your nukes? Question: Iran controls tens of thousands of Shiite militiamen in Iraq and Syria who were our tacit allies in defeating ISIS. Tehran also has huge influence over Iraq’s government and over certain regions of Afghanistan as well. Can we stabilize Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan — post-ISIS — and keep our troop presence low and safe, without Iran’s help — and will that help be coming after Trump rips up the nuclear deal? If you think so, please raise your hand. And since our European allies as well as Russia and China have indicated that they will not follow us in backing out of the Iran deal or reimposing sanctions, Iran would have all the moral high ground and money it needs, and the U.S. would be isolated. Are we going to sanction E.U. banks if they deal with Iran? Trump came into office vowing to end the trade imbalance with China — a worthy goal. And what was his first move? To tear up the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the trade deal that would have put the U.S. at the helm of a 12-nation trading bloc built around U.S. interests and values, potentially eliminating some 18,000 tariffs on U.S. goods and controlling 40 percent of global G.D.P. And China was not in the group. That’s called leverage. Trump just ripped up the TPP to “satisfy the base” and is now left begging China for trade crumbs, with little leverage. And because he needs China’s help in dealing with North Korea, he has even less leverage on trade. Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate accord and, at the same time, restricted U.S. government funding for birth control both at home and abroad. Question: What is driving so many immigrants and refugees in Africa, the Middle East and Central America to try to get out of their world of disorder and into America and Europe and the world order? Answer: It is a cocktail of climate change, environmental degradation, population explosions and misgovernance in these countries. So Trump’s policy is to throw away every tool we have to mitigate climate change and population growth and try to build a wall instead, while also trying to bully Mexico’s unpopular president into trade concessions, which could help elect a radical populist in next year’s Mexican election — a successor who would be anti-American — and destabilize its economy as well. At a time when China has decided to go full-bore into clean tech and electric cars, at a time when all of the tech giants are building data centers that they want powered by clean energy, at a time when solar and wind power are growing increasingly competitive with fossil fuels (and America still has a technological lead in many of these areas), at a time when climate change may be stimulating bigger hurricanes and forest fires that are costing us hundreds of billions of dollars, Trump’s central energy initiative is to reverse Obama’s and bring back coal-fired power. None of these dots connect. And we will pay for that. “Whiplash” was a great movie. But it’s a terrible organizing principle for our foreign or domestic policy. Advertisement"
"Putin Lifts Ban on Russian Missile Sales to Iran","Advertisement Supported by By  Neil MacFarquhar MOSCOW — President Vladimir V. Putin on Monday approved the delivery of a sophisticated air defense missile system to Iran , potentially complicating negotiations on Tehran’s nuclear program and further straining ties with Washington. The sale could also undermine the Obama administration’s efforts to sell Congress and foreign allies on the nuclear deal, which Iran and the United States are still struggling to complete. It might also reduce the United States’ leverage in the talks by making it much harder for the United States or Israel to mount airstrikes against Iran’s nuclear infrastructure if the country ignored such an agreement. “It is significant as it complicates the calculus for planning any military option involving airstrikes,” said David A. Deptula, a retired three-star general who served as the Air Force’s deputy chief of staff for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. The deal, worth an estimated $800 million to Russia , also reinforced Israeli and Arab fears that a nuclear pact and the subsequent lifting of sanctions would ignite the Iranian economy, making it a more formidable regional power. No timetable was announced for delivering the weapons, S-300 surface-to-air missiles. The sale was suspended five years ago amid a flurry of United Nations sanctions against the Islamic republic. Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, said that far from complicating the continuing negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program the missile sales would help them along. “It was done in the spirit of good will in order to encourage progress in the talks,” Mr. Lavrov said in a televised statement. “We believe that the need for this kind of embargo, indeed a separate, voluntary Russian embargo, has completely disappeared.” The missile deal does not pose a threat to Israel, Mr. Lavrov said, emphasizing that the S-300 is a defensive weapon. The five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and Germany have been negotiating with Iran for years to try to make sure that its nuclear program remains peaceful. The broad framework of a deal reached in Lausanne, Switzerland, on April 2 was preliminary, with several difficult issues still to be resolved by a June 30 deadline, including the pace at which sanctions should be lifted. The last thing proponents of the deal want to see is a rush to shower benefits on Iran before the final agreement is reached. Along with congressional Republicans, Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has been sharply critical of the nuclear deal, saying that although it would free Iran from debilitating economic sanctions, it would do nothing to stop the country from getting a nuclear weapon. On Monday, his intelligence minister, Yuval Steinitz, issued a statement saying the deal showed that “the economic momentum in Iran that will come in the wake of lifting the sanctions will be exploited for armaments and not used for the welfare of the Iranian people.” Iran, he added, “is being allowed to arm itself with advanced weapons that will only increase its aggression.” White House officials repeated the administration’s objections to the missile sale, noting that Secretary of State John Kerry had expressed those concerns recently to Mr. Lavrov. American and Iranian officials are using different words to describe elements of the preliminary agreement to limit Iran’s nuclear program. “I’m not in a position to speculate on the decision-making process that Russia is engaged in right now,” said Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary. “But I do think it’s safe to say that Russia understands that the United States certainly takes very seriously the safety and security of our allies in the region.” Mr. Earnest also said the administration was concerned about the possibility that Russia could enter into a deal with Iran to barter food for oil that could raise “potential sanctions concerns.” “We’ll obviously evaluate these two proposals moving forward,” Mr. Earnest said. “We’ve been in direct touch with Russia to make sure that they understand — and they do — the potential concerns we have.” Mr. Lavrov, alluding to recent airstrikes by Saudi Arabia and others against Iranian allies in Yemen, suggested that Iran needed a more robust air defense system. “For Iran, which is located in the volatile Middle East region, a modern air defense system is very important, especially now that tensions have run high in the surrounding environment,” he said. Mr. Lavrov also noted that Moscow could use the money. The Russian economy, battered by a steep drop in the price of oil and by Western sanctions imposed over Moscow’s actions on behalf of separatists in Ukraine, is expected to fall into a recession this year. Russia has been aggressively seeking new trade partners to prove that Western sanctions have not isolated it from the global economy. Although the full details have not been disclosed, the Russian news media reported that Moscow had negotiated an oil-for-goods exchange with Iran that would involve acquiring some 500,000 barrels of Iranian oil a day in exchange for Russian equipment and goods. Iran has long been one of the main buyers of Russian wheat, for example. “We need to think about the future of our trade partnership,” said Andrei A. Klimov, the deputy chairman of the foreign relations committee in the Federation Council, Russia’s Senate. “We don’t want to wait for anybody else. It is a kind of competition, if you like.” Since resuming the presidency in 2012, Mr. Putin has worked to restore some of the great-power status Russia lost with the disintegration of the Soviet Union, not least by cultivating relations with countries hostile to the United States, like Venezuela and, to some extent, China. Cultivating Iran fits into that pattern. For Russia, “it is always good to have some third world countries hostile to the West, hostile to America,” said Georgy I. Mirsky of the Institute of World Economy and International Relations, who is one of Russia’s leading Middle East analysts. Even if an eventual nuclear agreement drives some degree of reconciliation between the West and Iran, the early lifting of the missile deal signals that “Russia will always be a really loyal partner and, if not an ally, at least a friend of Iran,” he said. Not surprisingly, Iran praised the move as an important step toward improved relations. “If Russia fulfills its commitment to deliver the S-300 missile system to Iran, it will be a step towards boosting the relations and collaborations between the two countries,” Iran’s deputy defense minister, Reza Talaei-Nik, told the semiofficial Tasnim News Agency on Monday. “It will be a step forward.” There was some debate as to just how much the missiles would improve Iran’s military capabilities. The five S-300 squadrons cannot shield all of Iran’s nuclear facilities, said Simon Saradzhyan, an expert on arms control and Russia at Harvard University’s Belfer Center, while noting that Russia just sold China the more sophisticated S-400 system. The official Tass news agency reported that in February Moscow offered Tehran an air defense system more modern than the S-300, but that no decision had been made. Still, military experts said the highly capable S-300 system would make it much harder for the United States or Israel to stage airstrikes against Iran’s nuclear facilities. Although Iran denies that it is using its civilian nuclear program to mask efforts to build a bomb, many Western countries are dubious. And Israel has made no secret of its willingness to consider a military strike to halt Iran’s progress, though it is not known to possess bunker-buster bombs powerful enough to destroy all of Iran’s bomb-making capacity. More than missile systems, what Iran really needs is to escape the principal financial and economic sanctions, the ones that cut off substantial trade and access to much of the world’s banking system, Mr. Saradzhyan said.

"Two minutes to midnight: did the US miss its chance to stop North Korea’s nuclear programme?","An unprecedented US mission to Pyongyang in 1999 promised to defuse Kim’s nuclear threat. But it all came to nothing – and then the hawks took power. By  Julian Borger  Fri 30 Mar 2018 06.00 BST   Last modified on Tue 3 Apr 2018 11.35 BST   P yongyang International is one of the world’s quieter airports. The country’s chronic isolation means that there are not many places to fly, and few foreigners keen on visiting. At least until a new terminal was built in 2012, many of the flights on the departure boards were just for show, giving the appearance of connection with the outside world. They never actually took off. Against this melancholy backdrop, one day in late May 1999, something quite extraordinary happened. An official plane bearing the blue-and-white livery of the US government and emblazoned with the stars and stripes landed and taxied along the runway. The plane was carrying a former defence secretary, William Perry, who had been brought back from retirement by President Bill Clinton to try to end the frozen conflict between the US and North Korea. With a small group of aides, Perry was embarking on a mission that he hoped would avert a return to the armed stand-off that had brought the two countries to the brink of war five years earlier. The flightpath followed by Perry’s plane, which had taken off in Japan, had not been used since the Korean war. As it approached North Korean territory, Perry and his aides cracked dark jokes about whether anyone had remembered to tell the vigilant air-defence missile crews a few thousand feet below that they had an official invitation. Perry was arriving at a moment of high tension. The previous year, the regime in Pyongyang had shown off its proficiency in missile technology with a series of tests, including the launch of the long-range Taepodong-1, which sailed over Japan before splashing into the Pacific. Officially, the Taepodong-1 was intended to launch a satellite, but it relied on the same technology and rocket power as an intercontinental ballistic missile. And the only way such a missile is of real military use is when it has a nuclear warhead in its nose cone. By the time the US delegation arrived in Pyongyang, a 1994 agreement between Washington and Pyongyang, intended to prevent North Korea from ever becoming a nuclear weapons state, was fraying. Both sides were failing to deliver on their earlier promises. As part of the deal, known as the Agreed Framework, the US had undertaken to supply 500,000 tonnes of fuel oil a year to the famine-ridden state, but the shipments had begun to arrive late, as the Republican-controlled Congress tried to block every fuel purchase. Meanwhile, the Americans, Japanese and South Koreans were behind schedule on their agreement to develop light-water reactors for civilian energy generation inside North Korea . For their part, the North Koreans appeared to be involved in furtive activities, which – along with the missile launch – convinced US intelligence agencies that they were seeking to continue making fissile material for a bomb. Perry was carrying a letter from Bill Clinton to the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-il , who had inherited power in 1994 after the death of his father, Kim Il-sung, the the founder of the nation and the ruling dynasty. Along with Clinton’s letter to Kim expressing hope for better relations, Perry carried an explicit mandate from Japanese and South Korean leaders, authorising him to speak on their behalf, and the outline of a peace plan. In return for a broad renunciation of nuclear weapons and long-range missiles, North Korea would get more than oil and reactors – it would get a ticket back into the international community, including diplomatic ties and trade with the US. And potatoes. In the run-up to the Perry mission, North Korean officials had signalled that Kim Jong-il was convinced that potatoes were the way out of famine. In return for allowing US weapons inspectors to visit a suspicious underground site shortly before Perry’s visit, Pyongyang had initially demanded $300m, but eventually settled for 100,000 tonnes of potatoes. At the airport, there were Mercedes saloons on the tarmac and protocol officers waiting to drive Perry’s delegation to a government guesthouse through grand but deserted boulevards. “There were traffic police, but no traffic,” Perry recalled when we met recently in a hotel close to his former workplace, the Pentagon. After being driven through the tidy streets of the capital, Perry, straining to be complimentary, told his hosts how impressed he was by the modernity of the architecture, only to be reminded that the US air force had obliterated the original city. By this stage in his life, Perry could reasonably claim to know the risks of failure in nuclear diplomacy. As a defence contractor in the 1960s, he had spent the Cuban missile crisis scrutinising aerial photos and intelligence reports, thinking each day at work would be his last . He was undersecretary of defence in 1979, when he was woken up by a watch officer whose computer was showing 200 Soviet intercontinental ballistic missiles heading for the US. (It turned out to be a false alarm.) From 1994-97, he was Clinton’s defence secretary, and contingency plans for bombing North Korea had been on his desk at the peak of the 1994 crisis. One of Perry’s aims in travelling to Pyongyang in 1999 was to see if diplomacy with North Korea was even a possibility. He had begun his career as a mathematician and engineer, and was testing a hypothesis: that with the right mix of incentives and dire warnings of the alternatives, a comprehensive bargain could be struck. Looking back on Perry’s mission today, the question is whether the experiment failed, or whether it was closed down for political reasons before it had a chance to succeed. In the eyes of hawks like Donald Trump’s new national security advisor, John Bolton, the whole exercise was delusional and doomed to failure. (Bolton prides himself on having helped take a “hammer” to Perry’s experiment.) For Perry, most members of his diplomatic team, and many other observers, the flight to Pyongyang and the exchanges that followed in the next 18 months represent one of the great might-have-beens of diplomatic history, which – had it been allowed to reach its conclusion – could have set North Korea and the wider region on a much less dangerous path. Bolton, the enemy of that peace effort, will now be orchestrating Donald Trump’s summit with North Korea’s current leader Kim Jong-un, which is expected to take place in the next few months. It will be an unprecedented encounter, and will bring with it the chance of a historic breakthrough. However, Bolton has made clear that he thinks Trump should confront Kim Jong-un with an all-or-nothing choice: give up your nuclear weapons programme or face military consequences – a single roll of the dice. O ver four days in Pyongyang, Perry’s delegation would not catch a glimpse of the Dear Leader, but they felt his presence throughout, his image on scores of billboards, red lapel pins, and behind every word spoken and every question asked by the officials they were to meet. Accompanying Perry were two advisors who would later play key roles in the Obama administration: future defence secretary Ash Carter, and Wendy Sherman, a senior state department official who would play a leading role in the nuclear negotiations with Iran 15 years later. The party also included Evans Revere, the head of the Korea desk at the state department, a one-star marine general Wallace “Chip” Gregson, and Philip Yun, a Korean-American junior diplomat. On the first morning, the visit got off to an inauspicious start. Perry had asked to see a representative of the North Korean military, suspecting they might have their own views on peace talks. He was right. One of the regime’s top military officials strode into the first meeting and told the Americans he would rather not be there. “The first thing he said to me was: ‘This meeting was not my idea. I was directed to talk to you. I don’t think we should even be discussing giving up our nuclear programme’,” Perry told me. The general, who was dressed in full uniform, walked around the room shaking hands briskly with the party. “He was straight out of central casting,” said Revere, a fluent Korean speaker, who was acting as note-taker for the delegation. The general finally shook hands with Philip Yun, the sole Korean-American. “He was kind of a scary guy – he was short but really intense, and he held my hand a little bit longer than he held others’, and he looked at me,” Yun told me. “What I got was that I was a traitor to the homeland because I was a Korean American, and therefore scum.” The general warned his visitors: “If you bomb our cities, the next day you will find nuclear weapons going off in your cities … not excluding Palo Alto,” a pointed reference to Perry’s hometown. As the talks got going, the general dismissed efforts by the Korean foreign ministry officials to get a word in. “You don’t have to listen to those neck-ties. They don’t know anything,” he said. It could have been a show of disagreement, a totalitarian version of “good cop, bad cop”, but to the American diplomats, the contempt seemed real. Much of Perry’s short stay in Pyongyang was spent with the regime’s top “neck-tie”, Kang Sok-ju, a tough, often prickly diplomat, who was known as a confidant of Kim Jong-il. In a series of meetings, which were punctuated by speeches about US perfidy and the virtues of the Kim family leadership, Kang would listen to the Americans’ proposals and come back the next day with questions. Perry assumed that after each encounter Kang was consulting with Kim Jong-il and then relaying the leader’s queries. Perry’s team had a precise plan of how to roll out the US proposal in stages. One part of the US proposal was to establish an “interests section” in Pyongyang, a small diplomatic mission that could evolve into a full embassy. “They were very interested in that, and had all sorts of questions about how to do that. The recognition, the international respect, loomed very large in their minds,” Perry said. “We were really trying to get more than an agreement on the technical issues of missiles or nuclear weapons. We were working to try to set up a situation in which North Korea could become a normal country.” Putting that prospect at the centre of the US offer, Perry said, was “the main distinction between our negotiations and all the ones prior to that. For this regime, and its eccentric leader, respect and standing were the most important things, which is why previous US attempts to intimidate North Korea through military and economic pressure alone had failed. To give ground under such circumstances would mean loss of face. “They go to great lengths never to show weakness,” said Suzanne DiMaggio, a senior fellow at the New America thinktank, who has played a leading role in back-channel talks with the North Koreans and Iranians. “It is disconcerting at times. You have to be prepared for it. Sometimes it comes across as confidence, other times as intransigence.” Perry’s delegation was wined and dined, taken to see the country’s top acrobats perform, and given a tour of Pyongyang. They visited the Juche Tower, a stone edifice erected in honour of the state ideology of self-reliance. And they toured a collective farm to see a rice-planting device said to have been invented by the leader, moved by the plight of his famished people. Everywhere they went, there were demonstrations of popular enthusiasm. At the collective farm, a 15-piece folk band popped up on a dike by the side of a field. At the Juche Tower, a bus stopped outside, seemingly by chance, and its passengers disembarked and went into a dance routine in the middle of the otherwise empty streets, like a Hollywood musical. “Everything was supposed to be ‘spontaneous’,” said Wendy Sherman, the state department official. “And there was a cameraman following everything we did with a 1950s hand-cranked camera. It was all rather surreal.” Throughout the trip, Perry’s group assumed their conversations were being monitored. “When we wanted to talk, we walked outside, even knowing there might be bugs in the trees,” Sherman said. “When we wanted to get a message across and were not sure who we should be talking to, we would sit in a waiting room and speak, knowing we were being listened to.” Amid all the mutual suspicion, a moment of genuine human connection materialised early in the trip when the group delivered a consignment of medical supplies to a children’s hospital. The director appeared genuinely grateful, and on the point of tears. The hospital had no antibiotics for its patients. A young girl was found and coaxed into shaking hands with the Americans, but first had to be convinced by the staff that they had not come to kill her, as the regime had always said they would. On the plane back to Japan, Perry’s team argued over whether the visit had been a success. Over the four days in Pyongyang, Kang and the other North Koreans had listened and asked questions, but made no counter-offer. The Americans were politely thanked for the visit and were told to expect a response. There was no immediate sense of breakthrough. Ash Carter was the lead spokesman for the pessimistic view. The demeanour and constant hectoring of the North Koreans left no doubt the mission had been a complete failure, he argued – it was a sign the time had come for tougher measures. Revere, the Korean speaker who had more a feel for the nuances of culture and language, led the opposing argument. “The point I made is that what we had heard was a North Korean version of ‘I’ll think about it’,” he said. “That’s not a negative message. They didn’t say no, and by North Korean terms that’s almost a ringing endorsement, and we should not slam the door.” The argument continued all the way back to Tokyo and then to South Korea, where there was a debate in a secure meeting room at the HQ of US Forces Korea Command, attended by the ambassadors to Seoul and Tokyo. The ambassadors backed Revere and ultimately helped win over Perry to the optimist camp. When Perry made the call to Washington, he assured the administration that the door to an agreement had at least opened a crack, and asked for patience. That hunch proved right, eventually. But the North Korean response was a long time coming. It was more than a year before the North Koreans signalled they were ready to resume the talks with a return visit. “We were hoping and prodding them to give us the return visit, and we waited and we waited and we waited. We couldn’t figure out what the problem was,” said Robert Carlin, a former CIA specialist on North Korea seconded by the state department to work with Perry. Kim Jong-il, as it turned out, had more pressing priorities. I n June 2000, just over a year after Perry’s trip and almost exactly 50 years after the outbreak of the Korean war, the leaders of North and South Korea met for the first time. South Korean president Kim Dae-jung had survived kidnapping, an assassination attempt and a death sentence under the US-backed South Korean dictatorship in the 70s and 80s. His rise to the presidency in 1998 marked a decisive break with the country’s past, including its policy of hard-edged containment of the North. Kim Dae-jung argued for a “sunshine policy” of detente with Pyongyang. In an exceptional political gamble, he flew to the North Korean capital, not knowing what kind of reception awaited him. But when the aircraft door opened, there was the diminutive figure of Kim Jong-il, pot-bellied in his trademark khaki boilersuit and outsized late-period Elvis Presley sunglasses. Thousands of people had been bussed to the airport to wave red paper flowers and chant the names of the two Kims. At the end of the trip, the leaders declared their commitment to the reunification of the peninsula “through the joint efforts of the Korean people”. This heady language created a sense of optimism that peace might now be possible. Kim Dae-jung was awarded the Nobel peace prize a few months later for his efforts. Now that relations had been restored with Seoul, the North Korean leader was finally ready to pursue the negotiations with the US that Perry had begun the previous year. “That apparently was the block,” Carlin said. Preparing the meeting with Kim Dae-jung had taken “a lot of their energy and attention. But the talks went very well. There was a sense we would be able to move.” It was not until September 2000 that the Pyongyang government signalled it was ready for the next major round of talks. And by this time, the Clinton administration had less than four months left to run. “It had taken over a year before the North Koreans said yes to the Perry process. It showed their inexperience and naivety that they left it to an election year,” said Philip Yun, the former state department official. In October 2000, Kim dispatched one of his top military officers, the 72-year-old war veteran Vice Marshal Jo Myong-rok, to Washington. Along the way, Jo stopped in California, where Perry held a dinner for him at Stanford University and took him on a tour of tech companies around San Francisco Bay, a personal request of Kim Jong-il’s. The tour included Lucent labs, a leader in optic fibre technology that was run by a Korean American, Jeong Kim. The Lucent visit had the twin benefits of demonstrating the technological benefits of cooperation with the west and the achievements of Korean Americans in the tech sector. It happened to be Fleet Week during the visit, and the Bay was full of battleships. As Perry and Jo were being driven over the Bay Bridge, jets from the Blue Angels, the US navy’s flight demonstration squadron, flew over in tight formation. “He must have thought it was all done for his benefit,” said Perry, who said nothing to disabuse him of that impression. The San Francisco stop-off was intended, like the visit to the children’s hospital in Pyonyang, to humanise diplomatic relations between two countries that were entirely unfamiliar to each other. In Philip Yun’s eyes at least, it went some way to succeeding. Growing up in the US, Yun’s favourite aunt and frequent babysitter would warn him that if he did not behave, North Korean soldiers would come for him. It was the stuff of his childhood nightmares, but here he was spending hours in the back of an official car, chatting with one of the regime’s top generals. “My mom’s from the North, and he sounded like my grandfather to me,” Yun recalls. “He just seemed tired.” In Washington, however, the old general had a surprise in store. Just before going to the White House, Jo went to his hotel to change from his business suit into full dress uniform, complete with rows of medals. The subsequent photographs of this martial embodiment of the Kim regime being greeted by Clinton in the Oval Office represented US acceptance of the Kims’ regime, exactly 50 years after Kim Il-sung launched a surprise attack across the 38th parallel into South Korea, and were a bigger prize for the North Korean regime, who paid attention to matters of protocol, than any number of fuel and grain deliveries. Jo opened a brown leather folder he had been clutching and handed Clinton a letter from Kim Jong-il, signalling his willingness to cease the production, sale and use of long-range ballistic missiles. Furthermore, Jo told Clinton, if the US president were to come to Pyongyang, “Kim Jong-il will guarantee that he will satisfy all your security concerns”. At the end of Jo’s trip, the two governments issued a joint statement, which was a more optimistic view of the relationship than anything before or since. “Recognising the changed circumstances on the Korean Peninsula created by the historic inter-Korean summit, the US and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea have decided to take steps to fundamentally improve their bilateral relations,” it stated, adding that talks would begin to “formally end the Korean war by replacing the 1953 armistice agreement with permanent peace arrangements”. But time was running out. The battle for the presidency between Al Gore and George W Bush was in full swing, and Clinton had only weeks to secure the legacy as a peacemaker that had eluded him that summer in Camp David, when the Israelis and Palestinians had come close to a historic deal and then balked. W ithin nine days of the Jo visit, the US secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, was in Pyongyang to finalise the deal and lay the groundwork for a presidential visit from Bill Clinton. North Korean officials bent over backwards to make sure her visit was a success. “It was clear that orders had come from the top that virtually anything the Americans wanted, they were to get,” said Robert Carlin, the former CIA officer who was in the advance team sent ahead to prepare for Albright’s arrival. “For example, the US security people brought a bomb-sniffing dog. The South Koreans had objected when we brought a bomb-sniffing dog on a visit, because this was an insult, but the North Koreans said: ‘Go ahead – sniff away.’” Kim Jong-il stage-managed Albright’s visit as an elaborate spectacle, with each scene designed to reveal him as an object of worship. He gave two extravagant banquets – the first time any US official had had the chance to study this mercurial leader close up. At one point, during a meal, Kim rose to propose a toast and down a large glass of wine in single extended gulp. “Spontaneously, all the North Koreans in the room get up and start clapping,” Philip Yun said. “There was a guy next to me, who was trying to get me drunk, and all the time you could tell he was looking at Kim Jong-il. The moment Kim took that drink, he got up in a second, mid-sentence, to applaud.” Meals were accompanied by entertainment. Groups of singers and dancers would suddenly appear to sing Korean and American classics, in shows choreographed like a Broadway musical. Wendy Sherman, who sat next to Kim during one of these performances, told him: “I feel like in another life you were a great director.” He replied by pointing out he owned every Oscar-winning film ever made. “He was the great puppet-master. It was all very disturbing,” Sherman said. Kim’s greatest surprise came at the end of the first day of talks. He told Albright, Sherman and the rest of the US party that the night’s programme of entertainment had been changed, and they were going to see something special. “We had no idea where we were being taken,” Sherman said. They were loaded into vehicles and driven through deserted Pyongyang streets to the city’s May Day Stadium. The car park outside was empty, and the stadium itself was dark, but when Kim led Albright into the arena, it erupted with more than 200,000 people shouting his name. All the Americans could do was stand at his side, to witness the adulation. “He was cheered for 10 minutes,” Sherman said. “It was more than awkward. It was very uncomfortable.” Kim Jong-il had ordered a rerun of the 50th anniversary celebration of the Communist Workers Party rally from the previous year. Kim and his guests watched animated pictures created by tens of thousands of flashcards being held up and switched with split-second timing by suited party members. Albright later said in a radio interview that the experience of being alongside the leader at the focal point of hysterical worship as “like being in some very strange movie”. A series of stadium-sized agricultural scenes were followed abruptly by a totally different image: a Taepodong missile launching amid clouds of smokes and flames, and appearing to travel across the arena. Kim turned to Albright, smiling, and said the virtual missile had been “the first satellite launch, and it would be the last”. Then he turned to Sherman and told her the same thing. Getting North Korea to agree to strict missile curbs was the key objective of the Albright visit, and she made it clear to Kim that she could not recommend a visit by Clinton until Kim could allay US concerns. The US had prepared a list of questions about Pyongyang’s understanding of the proposed restrictions, and had expected it to be answered by the country’s missile experts. But Kim demanded to see the questionnaire himself at the start of his second meeting with Albright, the day after the extravaganza at the Mayday Stadium. “And what he did was systematically start answering the questions, without asking the advisers sitting next to him,” Albright recalled. “So I think that he is informed on the subject, technically, and very much wanted to show that he was in charge.” Albright returned from Pyongyang convinced that Kim Jong-il was a pragmatist, and that a visit would put the seal on a historic deal. “President Clinton told me he would do whatever was needed to get the treaty signed, and he would have prevailed on the issue,” Perry said. However, on 7 November 2000, 10 days after Albright returned from Pyongyang, Americans went to vote in what turned out to be the most finely balanced presidential election in the nation’s history. If Vice President Al Gore had won, Clinton would probably have used his final weeks in office to make the trip to visit Pyongyang, but any such plans were put on hold through the torment of the vote tally in Florida that would decide the result. In the end, George W Bush’s lead in Florida was so slim that the result of the presidential election came down to a fierce legal battle between Democrat and Republican about whether or not there would be a manual recount of the votes, which Gore believed would grant him victory. To get the manual recount stopped, the Republican party flooded Florida with lawyers – one of the most aggressive of whom was a man with sandy hair, wire-rimmed glasses and a bristling moustache, named John Bolton. After the supreme court halted the recount, confirming Bush as president, Bolton was one of several Republican lawyers rewarded for their efforts in Florida. “People ask what [job] John should get,” said vice president-elect Dick Cheney at the time. “My answer is: anything he wants.” Bolton was made undersecretary of state for arms control, although he was a splenetic opponent of almost all arms-control agreements, especially with North Korea. In his memoir, Surrender Is Not an Option, Bolton derides the “high-minded Clintonites” and “careerists” who believed peace was possible with North Korea. Even after Bush’s victory, the diplomats who had been pursuing a peace deal with Pyongyang thought all was not lost. Colin Powell, the former general appointed as Bush’s secretary of state, was enthusiastic about a potential agreement. According to Perry, “Colin assured me and assured Clinton that he liked this agreement and was going to go through with it. And he intended to do that.” As late as 6 March 2001, Powell stated publicly that the new administration planned “to engage with North Korea, to pick up where President Clinton left off.” He was wrong. Cheney and the new defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, shared Bolton’s antipathy to talks, and won the day with Bush. The view of the Bush hawks was that the Clinton administration’s contact with Pyongyang represented a reward for the regime’s human-rights atrocities and violations of arms agreements. “September 11 pushed North Korea to the side, but by year’s end I was able to move on to the offensive toward dismantling the failed Agreed Framework and its various manifestations,” Bolton wrote in his memoir. In Bush’s state of the union speech in January 2002, he named North Korea alongside Iran and Iraq as a member of the “axis of evil”. Robert Carlin stayed on at his post running the north-east Asia division at the bureau of intelligence and research, trying to change minds, but to no avail. He left in May 2002. “I went through the descent and crash landing,” he told me. “We kept writing memos to Powell trying to get him to understand what we had accomplished and what was still possible. I think he got it, based on the comments that he put on some of the papers. But he was already hogtied.” N ow 90, Perry spends his time travelling the world, accompanied by his daughter, Robin, warning of the dangers of a nuclear conflict, trying to persuade a generation of leaders who have risen to power after the cold war that just because a nuclear weapon has not been used in conflict since Nagasaki, it does not mean we are safe from conflagration. In his view, we have just been lucky. John Bolton will bring with him to his new role of national security adviser a firm preference for solving global problems with US military power, rather than give-and-take diplomacy. In the past, he has repeatedly pressed for a strike against North Korea, despite the likelihood of devastating retaliation against South Korea. But since the last time Bolton was in the White House, and in part because of the Bush administration’s disastrous invasion of Iraq, the US has lost its global primacy. Kim Jong-un is far less interested in the idea of western acceptance than Kim Jong-il, and unlike his father, he can wield a proven nuclear arsenal. At the same time, China’s power has risen exponentially, and President Xi Jinping is more willing than his predecessors to wield that power on the world stage. When Kim travelled to Beijing this week to talk to Xi, the Chinese leader did not even bother to inform Donald Trump until after the North Korean’s personal train had already arrived. Trump, Bolton and the new secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, blame their predecessors for the current predicament. Barack Obama’s policy of “strategic patience”, waiting for sanctions to corrode North Korea’s will to hold on to their weapons, was half-hearted and an admission of weakness, they say. As for Perry’s 1999 trip and the brief blossoming of diplomacy that followed, the hawks see it as delusional at best, and at worst, naked appeasement of a brutal regime. As proof, they point to the conclusion by the US intelligence community in the summer of 2002 that the North Koreans had been cheating all along: while they had agreed to dismantle their plutonium facilities, they had secretly been buying uranium enrichment technology from the Pakistani nuclear smuggler, AQ Khan, to pursue another route to the bomb. Evans Revere, who argued vehemently on the plane back from Pyongyang with Perry in 1999 for the Clinton administration to pursue talks, now believes the Americans were being hoodwinked all along. “The irony is that over the years, I have pretty much come around to the [hardline] view on this,” Revere said. “If I knew back then what I know now, I would have probably taken that position. At the end of the day, I am now absolutely convinced that denuclearisation was never seriously a North Korean goal or objective,” he said. The Pyongyang regime, Revere added, was “determined to pursue nuclear weapons development at all costs, because it decided years ago that it was the only way to guarantee its continued existence as a regime.” Other members of the 1999 delegation to Pyongyang draw different lessons. At the time, US intelligence had substantial evidence that the regime was pursuing a covert uranium programme, but that did not stop the US mission. The plan was to confront the regime with the evidence when US leverage was at its peak, all the benefits of a deal for North Korea were on the table, and Pyongyang had most to lose by walking away. “The uranium programme was a secret, but we knew about it, certainly by 1999 and even earlier than that,” Carlin said. Given the delays to the US deliveries of fuel oil and light-water reactors, he argued, it made some sense for Pyongyang to take out an insurance policy, a plan B. The question was: would the regime give it up? Carlin concedes there is no guarantee that Kim would really have given up his uranium programme in order to keep the benefits of the agreement with the US. But, he said, “It would have been a pretty interesting set of debates in Pyongyang about where to go. That’s the best you can hope for. But Kim didn’t have to make that choice after John Bolton came in.” The Bush administration’s attempts at pressure and isolation did not have the desired effect. Refusing bilateral talks, Pyongyang expelled International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors, restarted its nuclear reactor in Yongbyon, test-launched a battery of new missiles, and conducted its first underground nuclear test in October 2006. The US had no plausible military response, and by the end of 2007, Bush was offering Kim Jong-il a similar package to Perry, including fully normalised relations with the US. More recently, under Trump’s policy of “maximum pressure”, North Korea has once again accelerated its weapons development, culminating in three intercontinental ballistic missile tests and the detonation of a thermonuclear bomb in September 2017. Bill Perry believes we are as close to catastrophe now as we were in the cold war, and getting nearer as the Trump administration takes an ever more bellicose approach. “As long as North Korea believes that the object of the US is overthrow the regime, and to use military power to do it, they’re going to keep that nuclear arsenal. So without dealing with that fundamental issue, we are never going to get the agreement we would like,” Perry told me. That was what was lost in 2000, he argued. “I think we missed the opportunity to stop their nuclear programme.” • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread , or sign up to the long read weekly email here ."
"An American Diplomat in Europe","Advertisement Supported by By  Bret Stephens Opinion Columnist BERLIN — “It’s like being a gay conservative in the Republican Party.” That is Richard Grenell’s instant reply to my question about what it’s like being an American diplomat in Europe with Donald Trump as president. Grenell, the new U.S. ambassador to Germany, is conservative, gay and, as of this week, already controversial. He doesn’t seem to mind at all. The controversy stems from his Tuesday tweet urging that “German companies doing business in Iran should wind down operations immediately.” Germans were not amused by what sounded like Orders From Headquarters. Wolfgang Ischinger, a former German ambassador to Washington, tweeted back: “Never tell the host country what to do, if you want to stay out of trouble.” Grenell, speaking from his office with expansive views of the Tiergarten and the glass-domed Parliament building, is having none of it. “I didn’t say ‘you must.’ I didn’t say ‘you have to.’ The word ‘should’ is at a moral level. You can’t do business in Iran without giving money to the mullahs and to the I.R.G.C.,” he says in reference to Tehran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, the entirety of which was sanctioned for terrorism by the U.S. in October. “We have an obligation to explain this, and they”— German industry — “get to choose.” Well, sort of. On Tuesday, the Treasury Department issued a detailed guidance memo on what sanctions come back into effect and when. Six months from now, “secondary sanctions” imposed against companies and people who do certain types of business with Iran will be back in force. That means a sword hangs over the head of any European company doing business with Tehran that also has, or seeks, a market in the U.S. The European Union’s entire trade with Iran amounts to $25 billion. With the U.S.: $755 billion. It’s why the idea that Europe will break with Washington in protest of Trump’s Iran decision is absurd. But it’s also why there’s so much resentment. How to ease the resentment? “The payoff is the trade issues,” Grenell says, hinting that the administration is prepared — in exchange for strong cooperation on Iran — to climb down from its threats to impose steel and aluminum tariffs and to start a trade war with Europe. He also waxes nostalgic about the depth and breadth of U.S. cooperation with Germany during his time working as U.S. spokesman at the United Nations, including for then-Ambassador John Bolton. Grenell’s close ties to the now-national security adviser make him the only U.S. ambassador in Europe with any White House clout. That still leaves unanswered the question of where (if anywhere) the U.S. and Europe go from here on Iran. “Look at the E3 statement; read it to the end,” Grenell says, referring to Tuesday’s joint declaration by Britain, France and Germany on Trump’s exit from the Iran deal. “We are united in denying nuclear Iran. We want to state the goal, not the tactic.” The statement to which Grenell refers acknowledges that the nuclear deal had critical shortcomings: its sunset provisions, the weakening of restrictions on ballistic missiles, Iran’s “destabilizing regional activities.” The differences between Europe and the Trump administration hinged on the question of whether the problems could be resolved within the framework of the agreement. Trump concluded they could not. He also said he was “ready, willing, and able” to “make a new and lasting deal.” This is not the nixing of diplomacy, as some would have it. It’s the “nix to fix” strategy the Washington Institute’s Rob Satloff proposed in 2015 . Do Europeans want to be part of that fix? They should. The peril with Washington’s current sanctions strategy is that it will do much more to punish Iran’s people than it will their leaders. But using sanctions to send Iran into a hyperinflationary spiral may do little more to loosen the regime’s grip than Venezuela’s hyperinflation has done to bring down Nicolas Maduro’s dictatorship. A policy of immiseration is a lousy pressure strategy for the West — and an excellent propaganda tool for the mullahs. The better play is to hit Iran’s leaders at the nexus of power, corruption and terror, using targeted tools such as the Global Magnitsky Act. Iran is a kleptotheocracy , in which the ruling clerics and the Revolutionary Guards have built financial empires based on expropriation and theft. One “charitable foundation” run by Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei was estimated in 2013 to control $95 billion in assets. Hitting that nexus with a combination of sanctions, criminal penalties and public disclosures of hidden financial assets would be morally right, popular with ordinary Iranians and useful for concentrating the minds of Iran’s leaders on resuming serious nuclear negotiations. It should not be a hard call for Europeans to sign on and steer a smarter pressure policy. Among the disasters of Trump’s first year is that, instead of tough diplomacy, the United States had no diplomacy at all. The promise of Grenell’s presence in Berlin is that this might at last be about to change. Advertisement"
"Outside the EU, Britain faces a bleak future in Trump’s world","Wed 26 Dec 2018 12.06 GMT   Last modified on Wed 26 Dec 2018 12.45 GMT   D isagreements over the terms of Britain’s departure from the EU are obscuring the daunting international challenges that await the country once it supposedly shakes off Europe’s shackles. It’s a tough, unforgiving world out there, and 2019 is shaping up to be an even bigger rough-house than usual. By jettisoning a pivotal alliance, Britain no-mates is seriously weakening its capacity to manage these looming threats. The spectre of Donald Trump lies at the heart of ominous turbulence on the global horizon. Nearly halfway through his term, the 45th US president is helping to create a world where old rules don’t apply and long-held assumptions, such as Britain’s claim to a “special relationship” with Washington, are an anachronistic embarrassment. Trump’s is an anarchic realm, dangerous, delusional and chaotic – comparable to a dysfunctional Florida theme park – on which a category five hurricane is bearing down. It is characterised by structural vandalism, and fuelled by self-interest, insults and lies. Trump’s ignorant, confrontational persona informs concerted US efforts to overturn or bypass the rules-based international order – he regularly attacks and undermines the United Nations , the European Union, Nato, the international criminal court, the international court of justice, the World Trade Organisation and efforts to address climate change . It encourages bad behaviour everywhere. To survive on its own in a world full of hazards, Britain is relying on the familiar frameworks, multilateral institutions, laws, regulations, diplomatic conventions and commercial codes that have governed state-to-state relations since 1945. But it is exactly this consensual rulebook that Trump is recklessly tearing up. If there is to be a US trade deal with supplicant Britain, for example, it will be on Trump’s onerous “America first” terms . If the whim takes him, his punitive tariff wars will intensify, regardless of their impact on struggling partners. Britain may cast itself as a 21st-century champion of free trade and international engagement, but it is Trump’s protectionist, isolationist and nationalist tropes that are trending worldwide. In Trump’s fearful world, the night is full of terrors, and that’s especially true of 2019. The president needs a scary distraction from the deep legal and political trouble he is in at home , especially as he desires a second term. This distraction would preferably come from overseas – for in Trump’s world, foreigners are defined not as friends but as potential foes. Deliberately intensifying the US confrontation with Iran is one deflective possibility. Trump has worked hard to provoke Tehran , reneging on the 2015 nuclear deal and imposing new sanctions over British objections. The Israelis and Saudis would be up for a fight. But for Britain, it would be an unpropitious start to post-Brexit global outreach. At the same time, Trump’s hostility to existing military deployments overseas presage problems on other key policy fronts. A prime example is his rash decision to ignore UK advice and abandon the fight against Islamic State in Syria . US troop withdrawals from Afghanistan, where Britain recently increased troop numbers, may follow. James Mattis, the defence secretary, could not stop him, and resigned in protest . After Brexit, belittled Britain will have less say than ever. Russia is a leading beneficiary of Trump’s contempt for western solidarity and shared values – and a big problem for Britain no-mates. Vladimir Putin poisoned at will in Salisbury , subverted the Brexit vote, and regularly violates British sea, air and cyberspace . His covert hooliganism extends from the Barents Sea to the Sea of Azov. Russian “malign activity” in 2019 will underscore the reality that, in or out, Britain’s external defence and security remain intimately linked to Europe’s . Then there are EU allies to consider. Are they now to be forgotten? Angela Merkel, a European standard-bearer reviled by Trump and German xenophobes alike, is on her way out. France’s unpopular president, Emmanuel Macron, is besieged . If the Franco-German centre cannot hold, rightwing populist-nationalists from Italy to Poland will profit. The threats to Europe’s democratic order are real and pressing. This is Britain’s fight, too, as history shows. So forget the Irish backstop for a minute. Forget the price of fish. Who will stop Putin and the onwards march of Europe’s hard-right? Not Trump. He welcomes anything that weakens the EU. If or when such crisis points arrive, even the most intransigent Eurosceptic may finally grasp the inescapability of Britain’s European ties and the true worth of European unity. The post-Brexit challenge posed by China is of a different order: as much moral as economic. The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, is running one of the most repressive regimes on Earth, under whose grim auspices Muslims in Xinjiang, Buddhists in Lhasa, “house church” Christians in Beijing, pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong, and independent media, academics and writers suffer hugely. Trump does not give a hoot about human rights in China or anywhere else. But the British traditionally do. Does Britain really want to become further entangled with a communist dictatorship whose internal repression is matched by an aggressively expansionist, illiberal world view? As the head of MI6 noted recently, there are also grave security risks especially if, as in Britain, Chinese companies are investing in nuclear power and telecoms infrastructure . So, bottom line: how much would Liam Fox and friends give up to sweeten a deal with Beijing? They should remember, while counting pennies and yuan, that values matter more than VAT. Trump’s second-rank friends are an equally unappealing bunch. Saudi Arabia is a player these days, economically and politically. Yet British gun-running to Riyadh has always been objectionable, ethically speaking. Dodgy deals of that type will be even more insupportable in future, now we know the Saudi crown prince counts assassins among his subordinates . Turkey is another big market – and no friend to Brussels. But does Britain really want to cosy up to Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, whose idea of a good day at the office is killing Kurds and locking up a newspaper editor or two? Or take emerging Brazil. A lot of jolly juicy opportunities there, as Boris Johnson might say. Except Brazil recently elected a hard-right president who plans to burn down the Amazon for cash . This does not sit well with Britain’s climate change commitments. If push comes to shove, it’s even suggested Britain could revive old Commonwealth ties to sustain its venture into the unknown. But who in the modern Commonwealth needs Britain? India, for example, has moved on since the days of empire. In 2019, its GDP will overtake Britain’s . Any deal with Delhi will be costly. And it may not be long before belittled Britain forfeits its permanent seat on the UN security council, too. Old roles are reversed. The balance of power shifts. In Trump’s world, nobody respects weaklings and has-beens, especially when they used to run the show (or thought they did). Viewed from all those places formerly coloured pink in the atlas, Brexit increasingly looks like payback time. In spurning its European home, self-destructive Britain casts itself unready and unloved into a world of pain. • Simon Tisdall is a foreign affairs commentator"
"Macron’s Art of the Deal","Advertisement Supported by By  Roger Cohen If there’s a better angel of President Trump’s nature, a doubtful proposition, then President Emmanuel Macron of France is determined to summon it through a mixture of Gallic logic and alpha-male charm. In a wide-ranging conversation in English with a handful of journalists in New York, Macron said that with the Paris climate accord as with the Iran nuclear agreement, “What I want to convince him is that the solution is not to break what we have.” Trump has said he’ll withdraw from the Paris deal unless it can be renegotiated, but no concrete steps have been taken for the United States to quit. The president has also been implacably hostile to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, although it has slashed Iran’s enrichment program under strict international monitoring and stopped the country well short of North Korea’s nuclear-weapon status. Trump keeps hinting he’ll tear up what he’s called “the worst deal ever.” Macron, who described his relationship with Trump as “extremely direct,” said he wants to show the president “that he puts himself in deadlock because on these different issues, what’s his alternative? He doesn’t have any. On climate, even on Iran, there is no alternative. So we have to rebuild some multilateralism where your president finds his place.” That’s a tough assignment in that Trump has not yet met a multilateral organization he doesn’t disparage, embraces an America-first ideology, and loves the idea of “sovereignty” so much he referred to it more than 20 times in his United Nations speech this week. But Macron, who upended France’s political landscape in the space of a year, is not one to be daunted by near impossible challenges. Descending from the Jupiter-like heights that have marked the early months of his presidency (an attempt to reignite French pride through the Gaullist majesty of his office), Macron was frank and chatty as he outlined his ideas to cajole Trump from self-defeating rage toward productive reason — a thankless task in which the French upstart should have the world’s full backing. With Trump and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany at odds, and the initial American-British love fest fraying over wild Trump outbursts , Macron is probably the last best hope for America’s allies to restrain the apocalyptic side of Trump’s nature. There’s chemistry in the relationship. Of course, if he fails, the risk for the French president is that he will be seen as Trump’s lackey. On the Paris deal, Macron said he’d told Trump: “That’s a big choice because you can be the great power within the multilateral framework taking the lead and sometimes trying to impose your view, but leaving the club is something totally different because you take the risk to be much more marginalized.” He added that if Trump does take America out, “I do believe in the mid-run it’s very negative even for U.S. business.” Macron said he didn’t know if Trump had second thoughts. But it was clear the French president doesn’t consider Trump’s climate decision final. He wants to find “concrete solutions” that, short of a renegotiation of the Paris accord, still provide Trump with “something belonging to him regarding climate.” As an example, he cited the International Solar Alliance, designed to ramp up solar energy in sun-rich countries. Macron will travel to India later this year and, together with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, convene the alliance, a Franco-Indian initiative. Trump is “very sensitive to the Indian approach, he likes Modi a lot, and affection is a driver for him,” Macron said, suggesting that Trump “can be part of it.” Turning to Iran, Macron said it would be a “mistake” for the United States to break the accord. “We will put ourselves vis-à-vis Iran in a North Korean situation — breaking any discussion, trying to put them apart from the rest of the club, and discovering in X years that they get to a nuclear weapon.” Instead, Macron argued, the deal must be preserved and complemented with discussion of Iran’s ballistic missile program, of its “very unacceptable strategy” in the region, and of what will happen after the agreement expires in 2025. These are very ambitious, probably unattainable ideas, especially after Trump’s United Nations dismissal of Iran as a “murderous regime” and the prompt retort from Mohammad Javad Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister, that Trump’s was a “hate speech” worthy of “medieval times.” But on the core point — the folly of any United States abandonment of the nuclear accord — Macron has every reason to try to hold Trump back. The president, who has until Oct. 15 to certify Iran’s compliance with the deal to Congress, says he’s made a decision . The signs are that it could well be negative. That could set in motion a disastrous unraveling. Preserving the Iran deal, which is working, is a no-brainer for all but those with an interest in seeing Iran cast in permanence as a kind of Middle Eastern Satan. It has increased the distance between Iran and a bomb even as it has reduced the distance between Iran and the world. As I wrote when the deal was concluded in 2015: “The Iran nuclear deal is not perfect, nor was it ever intended to address the long list of American-Iranian grievances, which will persist. It must be judged on what it set out to do — stop Iran going nuclear — not on whether Iran has a likable regime (it does not) or does bad things (it does).” Macron argued repeatedly for multilateralism as the means to exercise effective sovereignty in the 21st century. It is to this view that he wants to coax Trump. A lot hinges on his success. “It’s impossible for France to be sovereign vis-à-vis these great risks, I mean regarding terrorism, migrations and so on, and be alone,” Macron said. He added that Trump sometimes gave the impression that, for him, sovereignty equaled isolation. But that, Macron said, is “not even feasible for the United States today.” On the domestic front, where polls show his popularity falling sharply, Macron said he’s in a hurry to pass labor reforms intended to make the French job market more flexible and cut unemployment, which at almost 10 percent is more than double the German level. “I was not elected to preserve the status quo,” he said. “My program was based on a transformation agenda for France.” The president, whose new political movement shattered the dominance of the traditional parties of left and right, said he had political capital that would be squandered if he does not use it fast: “That’s why I have to rush. It will take months, it will be tough, but we will, I will complete the labor market reform.” Labor union protests against the reform of the 3,324-page labor code have already erupted — and will get worse. As Macron said, France is a country where “if they can block, they block.” Other presidents have failed in the reform endeavor. Among other measures, the overhaul would allow small companies to negotiate some workplace issues directly with employees outside of industrywide agreements or unions. It would cap compensation limits in unfair dismissals and shorten the time employees have to challenge them in court. The number of bodies through which workers consult on health and safety issues would be reduced from three to one. Parliament has given Macron the green light to make these changes by ordinance, meaning they will go into effect after he signs them. It’s a big gamble, of the kind by now familiar to Macron. He’s well aware of the dangers. He talked about how the roots of the surge in populism and illiberal authoritarianism lie in a failure of Western democracies to “regulate the excess of capitalism” and provide prosperity to the middle class. Without the support of the middle class, he suggested, democracy wilts. So Macron’s will be a balancing act. Its success is crucial to the stemming of authoritarianism — both in Europe and in Trump’s United States. I would not bet against him, especially if the French-German alliance can be revived in the name of a liberal, democratic European Union.

"G.O.P.’s Invitation to Netanyahu Is Aiding Obama’s Cause on Iran","Advertisement Supported by By  Jeremy W. Peters WASHINGTON — President Obama’s relations with Democrats on Capitol Hill have never been especially close. But one man is helping to bring them a little closer together: Benjamin Netanyahu. The decision by the Israeli prime minister to accept an unusual invitation from House Republicans to address a joint meeting of Congress has had the unintended effect of helping the president rally Democrats as his administration negotiates a delicate nuclear deal with Iran . For months, the issue of imposing sanctions on Iran split many Democrats from the president , as they feared his posture was emboldening the government in Tehran to further develop its nuclear program. But Mr. Netanyahu’s planned speech, a provocation of the president that many Democrats found distasteful and undiplomatic, has helped shift the political dynamic. “For the prime minister to accept made it extremely political, knowing how the invitation played out,” said Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia and a frequent critic of the White House. Mr. Manchin was one of 10 Democrats who signed a letter agreeing not to vote on a sanctions bill until after the March 24 deadline to have a framework of an agreement in place with the Iranians. Speaker John A. Boehner’s decision to invite Mr. Netanyahu, and the prime minister’s decision to accept without consulting the Obama administration, Mr. Manchin added, struck some Democrats, like him, as off-putting. “It didn’t show a lot of class,” Mr. Manchin said. “If it had been George W. Bush or Reagan or Clinton or whoever, protocol is protocol.” The invitation proved to be opportune for Mr. Obama, who had been making steady progress in persuading Democrats to delay a vote on sanctions to give him some diplomatic breathing room. The president had been “changing minds,” said Senator Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut. “I don’t think the invitation has been helpful to the debate in Congress,” Mr. Murphy added, saying he believed Mr. Netanyahu’s speech would only further politicize an issue that should be above partisanship. “My worry all along has been that Republicans are going to oppose this deal simply because it’s President Obama’s deal, and the invitation to Netanyahu confirms that there are some Republicans who simply put politics ahead of what’s best for the country.” Other Democrats were also quickly lining up behind the president. A group of House Democrats will formally ask Mr. Boehner to delay his invitation to the prime minister until after the March deadline passes. Three Democratic representatives were circulating a letter to the speaker among their colleagues on Wednesday. It was already picking up additional signatures. The letter accuses the speaker of harming American foreign policy and undermining Mr. Obama. “As members of Congress who support Israel, it appears that you are using a foreign leader as a political tool against the president,” said the letter, which was signed by Representatives Keith Ellison of Minnesota, Steve Cohen of Tennessee and Maxine Waters of California. “When the Israeli prime minister visits us outside the specter of partisan politics,” the letter continued, “we will be delighted and honored to greet him or her on the floor of the House.” Getting lawmakers to go on the record criticizing the prime minister will be complicated, however, because many Democrats fear antagonizing Mr. Netanyahu, the powerful pro-Israeli interests aligned with him, and Jewish voters in their districts. “There’s a lot of people who agree with this letter,” Mr. Ellison said. “Some will put their name on it. Some won’t. But the bottom line is, I haven’t run into anyone on our side who thinks this is a good idea.” Whether Iran is racing toward nuclear weapon capabilities is one of the most contentious foreign-policy issues challenging the West. The issue is delicate. Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, the senior Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee and an ardent defender of sanctions against Iran, insisted Wednesday that Mr. Netanyahu’s speech was not a factor in his decision not to press for an immediate vote. “It had absolutely no effect,” he said. Mr. Menendez made the surprising announcement on Tuesday that he and a group of nine other Democrats had written to the president to inform him that they would not vote for a sanctions bill before the March 24 deadline. It was a striking step back for a senator who last week likened the administration’s statements on the negotiations to “talking points that come straight out of Tehran.” Democrats said they saw two political issues in play. Domestically, Mr. Boehner and Republicans want to press their point that Mr. Obama’s foreign policy is weak. And in Israel, which holds its elections March 17, Mr. Netanyahu has political incentive to present himself as a man of steely resolve. The perception that Republicans and Mr. Netanyahu are approaching the debate over sanctions in an overtly political way has helped those who are opposed to further sanctions make their case, Democrats said. “It’s been building for days,” said Greg Rosenbaum, the chairman of the National Jewish Democratic Council, speaking about efforts to persuade Democrats to offer the president more flexibility. “But it really let loose this week.” Typically, policy on Israel has been one area where both political parties agree. And some observers said they feared the Netanyahu-Boehner episode was eroding that. “When that sense of mutual values and interest starts to be driven apart by partisan politics,” said Jeremy Ben-Ami, the president of J Street, an Israeli advocacy group, “it works to the long-term harm of the state of Israel.” An earlier version of this article stated incorrectly that Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut was one of the 10 Democrats who had signed a letter agreeing to delay a vote on a sanctions bill.

"How to Talk to Iran","Advertisement Supported by Op-Ed Contributors By  Seyed Hossein Mousavian and Mohammad Ali Shabani IF there are any two words in Persian that President Obama should learn, they are “maslahat” and “aberu.” Maslahat is often translated as expediency, or self-interest. Aberu means face — as in, saving face. In the nearly 34 years since the Islamic revolution in Iran, expediency has been a pillar of decision making, but within a framework that has allowed Iranian leaders to save face. If there is to be any resolution of the nuclear standoff, Western leaders must grasp these concepts.  Two examples illustrate this point. In 1988, after eight years of devastating war with Saddam Hussein’s Iraq, Iran’s first supreme leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, accepted a United Nations-brokered cease-fire agreement, deeming it to be in Iran’s maslahat. It was crucial that Iraqi forces had been pushed off Iranian soil, so Tehran could claim a victory. Thirteen years later, after the 9/11 attacks, the United States overthrew the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, which had sheltered Al Qaeda, in a matter of weeks. American troops would never have made it to Kabul and Mazar-i-Sharif with such speed had Iran’s leaders not acquiesced to the toppling of their enemies to the east. But the George W. Bush administration squandered an opportunity for dialogue by spurning this potential diplomatic overture by Iran. For thousands of years, Persian culture has been distinguished by customs that revolve around honor and esteem. Preserving one’s aberu is tantamount to maintaining one’s dignity. There are almost no instances in modern Iranian history when maslahat has trumped aberu. The West has poorly understood these concepts. This was particularly true under President Bush, who rewarded Iran’s tacit acceptance of the American invasion of Afghanistan by labeling Iran a member of an “axis of evil.” Following the 2003 allied invasion of Iraq, the Swiss ambassador to Iran reached out to Washington with an unofficial outline for a “grand bargain” with Tehran that would cover everything from Iran’s nuclear program to its support for militant groups in the region. Despite this bold step, Iran was left out in the cold. Vice President Dick Cheney is said to have dismissed the initiative , reportedly asserting that “we don’t talk to evil.” We now know, thanks to a recent memoir by the former Iranian nuclear negotiator Hassan Rowhani, that the Bush administration reached out to Tehran a year after dismissing the proposal. Not surprisingly, partly because of the blow to its pride, the Iranian government rejected the offer of direct, high-level talks as insincere. In the nine years since, Iran’s nuclear program — a major symbol of prestige for Iranians — has grown immensely. Things have gotten a lot more complicated. The pattern of missed opportunities has persisted for more than three decades now. The result is that Barack Obama is the sixth consecutive president who has been led to view Iran as a threat rather than an opportunity. It is time for America to exit this vicious cycle and disregard irrational voices intent on sabotaging efforts to reach an understanding. When Mr. Obama took office in 2009, he promised a real dialogue with Iran. Many in Tehran are still waiting for him to deliver on that promise. But how? The foundation of post-1979 decision making in Iran is the pursuit of sovereignty within a framework that balances maslahat and aberu. We believe Iran would be open to new measures regarding the transparency of its nuclear program, and would agree not to pursue any capability to enrich uranium beyond that needed to fuel atomic power plants, if its legitimate right to enrichment under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty was recognized and if an agreement to remove sanctions was reached. Equally important is how a deal would be implemented. Decades of mutual, institutionalized hostility have created a gulf of mistrust that neither side can unilaterally bridge. So getting the sequence right would be crucial to any accord. While Tehran views a deal on its nuclear program as being in its self-interest, Western leaders need to grasp that it would be devastating for Iran’s aberu to take the first step solely in exchange for promises. The dominant discourse in Tehran portrays the 2004 decision by the former Iranian president Mohammad Khatami to suspend uranium enrichment on a voluntary, temporary basis as a failure because it resulted only in humiliating calls by the West for an indefinite suspension. The moral of this narrative is that placing maslahat above aberu, even temporarily, leads to nothing good. In the coming months, Iran is expected to again engage with the so-called P5+1 (the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France, along with Germany). Mr. Obama and his team, including his chief Iran negotiator, Under Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, should reflect on the meaning of maslahat and aberu. Understanding the Iranian mentality is key to grasping why the Iranians won’t put expediency above dignity. The only way to stop the dispute over Iran’s nuclear program from spinning out of control is to offer the Islamic Republic a face-saving way out. Seyed Hossein Mousavian, a former spokesman for Iran’s nuclear negotiators, is a research scholar at the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton and the author of “ The Iranian Nuclear Crisis: A Memoir .” Mohammad Ali Shabani is a doctoral candidate at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London.

"Iranian asylum seekers could be sent home under deal with Tehran","Plan would allow Australia to forcibly return Iranians if Tehran guarantees they would not be persecuted or punished  Wed 9 Mar 2016 01.03 GMT   Last modified on Thu 23 Mar 2017 22.32 GMT   Thousands of Iranian asylum seekers caught in limbo in Australia could be returned home under a deal set to be discussed when Iran’s foreign affairs minister visits Australia next week. Dr Mohammad Javad Zarif will visit as part of a broader push from Tehran to improve its economic and diplomatic relations with the west after last year’s nuclear deal and the lifting of sanctions in January. An asylum deal is seen as a key agenda item for his visit, particularly from the Australian government’s perspective. There are about 9,000 Iranian asylum seekers in Australia’s immigration system. About 400 are on Nauru and Manus Island, but most are in Australia, in detention or living in the community on bridging visas. Iranians who do not to meet the Refugees Convention threshold for protection cannot be forcibly returned to Iran because Tehran refuses to accept anyone being repatriated against their will. As a result, hundreds of Iranians are stuck in limbo in Australia, unable to be deported and without any apparent prospect of being granted the right to stay. The new deal would enable Australia to forcibly return asylum seekers, in exchange for guarantees from Tehran they would not face persecution or punishment. Australia also wants to weaken its complementary protection regime, making it easier to send people back to places where they could potentially face significant harm. Historically, most Iranians seeking asylum in Australia are ultimately granted the right to stay because of a “well-founded fear” of persecution in their homeland. The latest available government statistics are from 2013-14. The protection visa grant rate for asylum seekers who arrived by plane was 87%, the protection visa grant rate for those who arrived by boat was 65.2%. Ethnic and religious minorities, homosexuals, journalists and opponents of the government face particular persecution in Iran . Since signing a framework agreement to limit its nuclear program with a host of global powers in April last year – the so-called P5+1 talks – Iran has sought to strengthen its economic and diplomatic ties with the west. And its emergence into more open relations is seen as timely globally. Iran is increasingly seen by western powers as a key player in helping broker a political solution to the long-running conflict in Syria, the major driver of the European refugee influx. The bulk of Australia’s economic and financial sanctions against Iran were lifted in January but it maintains restrictions on transferring nuclear proliferation-sensitive goods and weapons. Zarif is understood to also be meeting the immigration minister, Peter Dutton , the trade minister, Steve Ciobo, the trade envoy, Andrew Robb, and, diary permitting, the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull. An asylum deal between Australia and Iran was first publicly floated when the foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop , visited Tehran 12 months ago. A spokeswoman for Bishop said the government had made a priority of resolving the “legacy caseload” of asylum seekers still within the Australian immigration system. Iranian asylum seekers are a significant cohort of that caseload. Where people were found to not require Australia’s protection, the government would seek to return them to their country of origin. “Our preference is for people not owed protection to return voluntarily,” the spokeswoman said. “However, where people do not have a legal basis to remain they may be subject to deportation. “A key outcome of the [minister’s] visit to Iran in April 2015 was an agreement to commence a formal consular dialogue with Iran, which covers topics including people-to-people links and immigration issues including cooperation to prevent people smuggling. Officials-level talks are ongoing.”"
"Mohammad Javad Zarif: A Message From Iran","Advertisement Supported by Op-Ed Contributor By  Mohammad Javad Zarif TEHRAN — WE made important progress in Switzerland earlier this month. With the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council plus Germany, we agreed on parameters to remove any doubt about the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear program and to lift international sanctions against Iran. But to seal the anticipated nuclear deal, more political will is required. The Iranian people have shown their resolve by choosing to engage with dignity. It is time for the United States and its Western allies to make the choice between cooperation and confrontation, between negotiations and grandstanding, and between agreement and coercion. With courageous leadership and the audacity to make the right decisions, we can and should put this manufactured crisis to rest and move on to much more important work. The wider Persian Gulf region is in turmoil. It is not a question of governments rising and falling: the social, cultural and religious fabrics of entire countries are being torn to shreds. Endowed with a resilient population that has stood firm in the face of coercion while simultaneously showing the magnanimity to open new horizons of constructive engagement based on mutual respect, Iran has weathered the storms of instability caused by this mayhem. But we cannot be indifferent to the unfathomable destruction around us, because chaos does not recognize borders. Iran has been clear: The purview of our constructive engagement extends far beyond nuclear negotiations. Good relations with Iran’s neighbors are our top priority . Our rationale is that the nuclear issue has been a symptom, not a cause, of mistrust and conflict. Considering recent advances in symptom prevention, it is time for Iran and other stakeholders to begin to address the causes of tension in the wider Persian Gulf region. Iranian foreign policy is holistic in nature. This is not due to habit or preference, but because globalization has rendered all alternatives obsolete. Nothing in international politics functions in a vacuum. Security cannot be pursued at the expense of the insecurity of others. No nation can achieve its interests without considering the interests of others. Nowhere are these dynamics more evident than in the wider Persian Gulf region. We need a sober assessment of the complex and intertwined realities here, and consistent policies to deal with them. The fight against terror is a case in point. One cannot confront Al Qaeda and its ideological siblings, such as the so-called Islamic State, which is neither Islamic nor a state, in Iraq, while effectively enabling their growth in Yemen and Syria. There are multiple arenas where the interests of Iran and other major stakeholders intersect. The establishment of a collective forum for dialogue in the Persian Gulf region, to facilitate engagement, is long overdue. If one were to begin serious discussion of the calamities the region faces, Yemen would be a good place to start. Iran has offered a reasonable and practical approach to address this painful and unnecessary crisis. Our plan calls for an immediate cease-fire, humanitarian assistance and facilitation of intra-Yemeni dialogue, leading to the formation of an inclusive, broad-based national unity government. On a broader level, regional dialogue should be based on generally recognized principles and shared objectives, notably respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of all states; inviolability of international boundaries; noninterference in internal affairs; peaceful settlement of disputes; impermissibility of threat or use of force; and promotion of peace, stability, progress and prosperity in the region. A regional dialogue could help promote understanding and interaction at the levels of government, the private sector and civil society, and lead to agreement on a broad spectrum of issues, including confidence- and security-building measures; combating terrorism, extremism and sectarianism; ensuring freedom of navigation and the free flow of oil and other resources; and protection of the environment. A regional dialogue could eventually include more formal nonaggression and security cooperation arrangements. While this cooperation must be kept to relevant regional stakeholders, existing institutional frameworks for dialogue, and especially the United Nations, must be utilized. The secretary general could furnish the necessary international umbrella. A regional role for the United Nations, already envisaged in the Security Council resolution that helped end the Iran-Iraq war in 1988, would help alleviate concerns and anxieties, particularly of smaller countries; provide the international community with assurances and mechanisms for safeguarding its legitimate interests; and link any regional dialogue with issues that inherently go beyond the boundaries of the region. The world cannot afford to continue to avoid addressing the roots of the turmoil in the wider Persian Gulf region. This unique opportunity for engagement must not be squandered.  Mohammad Javad Zarif is the foreign minister of the Islamic Republic of Iran. به فارسی بخوانید (Read in Persian) Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter , and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter .

"Merkel offers German role in Iran-style nuclear talks with North Korea","Chancellor says deal with Tehran could be a blueprint for a process in which Germany and Europe would play a very active part  Sun 10 Sep 2017 16.43 BST   First published on Sun 10 Sep 2017 11.55 BST   Angela Merkel has offered German participation in any future nuclear talks with North Korea and suggested that the 2015 agreement with Iran could serve as a model for negotiations. The chancellor’s intervention reflects growing alarm in Europe that Donald Trump is worsening one nuclear crisis by repeated threats to use military force against North Korea , and seeking to trigger a second one by torpedoing the Iran deal to which Germany, France and the UK are among the signatories. “If our participation in talks is desired, I will immediately say yes,” Merkel told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung in an interview published on Sunday . She pointed to the example of the agreement sealed in Vienna in July 2015 by Iran, the five permanent members of the UN security council and Germany , describing it as “a long but important time of diplomacy” that ultimately had a good end. The difference lies in the heart of the bomb. Atomic bombs rely on nuclear fission to produce a blast: atoms of weapons-grade uranium or plutonium are split by neutrons, releasing energy as well as more neutrons - triggering a chain reaction. Hydrogen bombs incorporate nuclear fission and nuclear fusion. As in an atomic bomb, fission generates neutrons and energy. This energy is used to kick off the fusion of "heavy” types of hydrogen in another part of the bomb. The fusion reaction also releases energy and neutrons, which then trigger further fission reactions. The upshot is a far more powerful blast. A boosted atomic bomb is a sort of hybrid of the two approaches, using a small quantity of fusion material together with an atomic bomb core. It is not as powerful as a hydrogen bomb. “I could imagine such a format being used to end the North Korea conflict. Europe and especially Germany should be prepared to play a very active part in that,” Merkel said. In exchange for sanctions relief under the Vienna deal, Iran accepted strict limits on its nuclear programme as a reassurance to the international community that it could never build a bomb. North Korea, on the other hand, is believed to already have a nuclear arsenal which it insists is not up for negotiation. Kim Jong-un hosted an elaborate banquet in Pyongyang over the weekend for military leaders, scientists and technicians to celebrate the country’s sixth and most powerful nuclear test. The regime says the underground blast on 3 September was a two-stage thermonuclear device, or hydrogen bomb. The state news agency, KCNA , published photographs on Sunday showing Kim beaming with two of the scientific minds behind the country’s surprisingly fast progress - Ri Hong Sop, the head of the country’s nuclear weapons institute, and Hong Sung Mu, the deputy director of the ruling party’s munitions industry department. The UN security council will convene on Monday to consider a US resolution that would impose an embargo on oil exports to North Korea and technical imports from the embattled state, as well as a partial naval blockade giving UN member states the right to board and inspect ships suspected of sanctions-busting. China and Russia are expected to try to water down the resolution, while European council members are nervous that the Trump administration could consequently abandon the council as a forum for dealing with the North Korea crisis if it does not get its way. “I think the Europeans worry about the US going off the deep end,” said Richard Gowan, a UN expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations. European anxiety has already been aroused by Trump’s repeated emphasis on a possible military solution of last resort to contain North Korea, which many analysts fear increases the chance of miscalculation and a preemptive strike by either side. The UK defence secretary, Sir Michael Fallon, said on Sunday that “the dangers now of miscalculation or some accident triggering a response are extremely great”. North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme must be halted before it developed a ballistic missile capable of hitting London, he said, but a war must be avoided “at all costs”. “The United States is fully entitled to defend its own territory, to defend its bases and look after its people,” he said. “But this involves us. London is closer to North Korea and its missiles than Los Angeles.” Theresa May’s government is concerned about Trump’s stated intention to extricate the US from the Iran deal, which some diplomats worry is motivated principally by his determination to obliterate all aspects of Barack Obama’s legacy more than by material shortcomings in the agreement. British officials see the deal as an important diplomatic achievement but, with Brexit looming, the government is fearful of alienating Trump, on whom it will have to rely for a speedy and favourable bilateral trade deal. Trump has signalled he might not certify Iranian compliance with the deal to Congress in mid-October, when he is due to give his next endorsement. A report by the International Atomic Energy Agency earlier this month confirmed that Iran was abiding by the limits set down in the agreement, but the US envoy to the UN, Nikki Haley, said Trump could withhold certification even if there were no technical violations, by judging the deal no longer to be in the interests of US national security. European leaders will seek to persuade Trump not to abandon or weaken the agreement at the UN general assembly, which Trump is due to address for the first time on 19 September."
"Leaked cables show Netanyahu’s Iran bomb claim contradicted by Mossad","Gulf between Israeli secret service and PM revealed in documents shared with the Guardian along with other secrets including CIA bids to contact Hamas •  Read the leaked document here  Seumas Milne ,  Ewen MacAskill and  Clayton Swisher  Mon 23 Feb 2015 18.06 GMT   Last modified on Tue 6 Mar 2018 14.58 GMT   Binyamin Netanyahu’s dramatic declaration to world leaders in 2012 that Iran was about a year away from making a nuclear bomb was contradicted by his own secret service, according to a top-secret Mossad document. It is part of a cache of hundreds of dossiers, files and cables from the world’s major intelligence services – one of the biggest spy leaks in recent times. Brandishing a cartoon of a bomb with a red line to illustrate his point, the Israeli prime minister warned the UN in New York that Iran would be able to build nuclear weapons the following year and called for action to halt the process. But in a secret report shared with South Africa a few weeks later, Israel’s intelligence agency concluded that Iran was “not performing the activity necessary to produce weapons”. The report highlights the gulf between the public claims and rhetoric of top Israeli politicians and the assessments of Israel’s military and intelligence establishment. The disclosure comes as tensions between Israel and its staunchest ally, the US, have dramatically increased ahead of Netanyahu’s planned address to the US Congress on 3 March. The White House fears the Israeli leader’s anticipated inflammatory rhetoric could damage sensitive negotiations between Tehran and the world’s six big powers over Iran’s nuclear programme. The deadline to agree on a framework is in late March, with the final settlement to come on 30 June. Netanyahu has vowed to block an agreement he claims would give Iran access to a nuclear weapons capability. The US president, Barack Obama , will not meet Netanyahu during his visit, saying protocol precludes a meeting so close to next month’s general election in Israel. The documents, almost all marked as confidential or top secret, span almost a decade of global intelligence traffic, from 2006 to December last year. It has been leaked to the al-Jazeera investigative unit and shared with the Guardian. The papers include details of operations against al-Qaida, Islamic State and other terrorist organisations, but also the targeting of environmental activists. The files reveal that: • The CIA attempted to establish contact with Hamas in spite of a US ban. • South Korean intelligence targeted the leader of Greenpeace. • Barack Obama “threatened” the Palestinian president to withdraw a bid for recognition of Palestine at the UN. • South African intelligence spied on Russia over a controversial $100m joint satellite deal. The cache, which has been independently authenticated by the Guardian, mainly involves exchanges between South Africa’s intelligence agency and its counterparts around the world. It is not the entire volume of traffic but a selective leak. One of the biggest hauls is from Mossad. But there are also documents from Russia’s FSB, which is responsible for counter-terrorism. Such leaks of Russian material are extremely rare. Other spy agencies caught up in the trawl include those of the US, Britain, France, Jordan, the UAE, Oman and several African nations. The scale of the leak, coming 20 months after US whistleblower Edward Snowden handed over tens of thousands of NSA and GCHQ documents to the Guardian, highlights the increasing inability of intelligence agencies to keep their secrets secure. While the Snowden trove revealed the scale of technological surveillance, the latest spy cables deal with espionage at street level – known to the intelligence agencies as human intelligence, or “humint”. They include surveillance reports, inter-agency information trading, disinformation and backbiting, as well as evidence of infiltration, theft and blackmail. The leaks show how Africa is becoming increasingly important for global espionage, with the US and other western states building up their presence on the continent and China expanding its economic influence. One serving intelligence officer told the Guardian: “South Africa is the El Dorado of espionage.” Africa has also become caught up in the US, Israeli and British covert global campaigns to stem the spread of Iranian influence, tighten sanctions and block its nuclear programme. The Mossad briefing about Iran’s nuclear programme in 2012 was in stark contrast to the alarmist tone set by Netanyahu, who has long presented the Iranian nuclear programme as an existential threat to Israel and a huge risk to world security. The Israeli prime minister told the UN: “By next spring, at most by next summer, at current enrichment rates, they will have finished the medium enrichment and move[d] on to the final stage. From there, it’s only a few months, possibly a few weeks before they get enough enriched uranium for the first bomb.” He said his information was not based on secret information or military intelligence but International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reports. Behind the scenes, Mossad took a different view. In a report shared with South African spies on 22 October 2012 – but likely written earlier – it conceded that Iran was “working to close gaps in areas that appear legitimate, such as enrichment reactors, which will reduce the time required to produce weapons from the time the instruction is actually given”. But the report also states that Iran “does not appear to be ready” to enrich uranium to the higher levels necessary for nuclear weapons. To build a bomb requires enrichment to 90%. Mossad estimated that Iran then had “about 100kg of material enriched to 20%” (which was later diluted or converted under the terms of the 2013 Geneva agreement). Iran has always said it is developing a nuclear programme for civilian energy purposes. Last week, Netanyahu’s office repeated the claim that “Iran is closer than ever today to obtaining enriched material for a nuclear bomb” in a statement in response to an IAEA report. A senior Israeli government official said there was no contradiction between Netanyahu’s statements on the Iranian nuclear threat and “the quotes in your story – allegedly from Israeli intelligence”. Both the prime minister and Mossad said Iran was enriching uranium in order to produce weapons, he added. “Israel believes the proposed nuclear deal with Iran is a bad deal, for it enables the world’s foremost terror state to create capabilities to produce the elements necessary for a nuclear bomb,” he said. However, Mossad had been at odds with Netanyahu on Iran before. The former Mossad chief Meir Dagan, who left office in December 2010, let it be known that he had opposed an order from Netanyahu to prepare a military attack on Iran. Other members of Israel’s security establishment were riled by Netanyahu’s rhetoric on the Iranian nuclear threat and his advocacy of military confrontation. In April 2012, a former head of Shin Bet, Israel’s internal security agency, accused Netanyahu of “messianic” political leadership for pressing for military action, saying he and the then defence minister, Ehud Barak, were misleading the public on the Iran issue. Benny Gantz, the Israeli military chief of staff, said decisions on tackling Iran “must be made carefully , out of historic responsibility but without hysteria”. There were also suspicions in Washington that Netanyahu was seeking to bounce Obama into taking a more hawkish line on Iran. A few days before Netanyahu’s speech to the UN , the then US defence secretary, Leon Panetta, accused the Israeli prime minister of trying to force the US into a corner. “The fact is … presidents of the United States, prime ministers of Israel or any other country … don’t have, you know, a bunch of little red lines that determine their decisions,” he said. “What they have are facts that are presented to them about what a country is up to, and then they weigh what kind of action is needed in order to deal with that situation. I mean, that’s the real world. Red lines are kind of political arguments that are used to try to put people in a corner.” Leaked spy cables obtained by al-Jazeera and the Guardian claim Israel has been trying to sabotage Egypt's water supply with water-sucking plants for decades"
"Bullet-riddled cars and lush gardens: Iran's memorial to its 'nuclear martyrs'","As international nuclear negotiations stutter on, this macabre museum pays tribute to the scientists the state claims were murdered by Israeli spies  Ian Black in Tehran  Thu 2 Jul 2015 11.30 BST   Last modified on Wed 29 Nov 2017 15.14 GMT   O n a terraced hillside in north Tehran, four white canvas marquees contain a disturbing sight: ordinary-looking cars damaged by bombs or riddled with bullets. Each is a macabre memorial to the scientists who died in them – victims of the shadowy war on Iran’s nuclear programme. In a week that has seen another deadline for international negotiations on the issue come and go, Iranians have been paying their respects to these “nuclear martyrs” at the Museum of Holy Defence and the Promotion of Resistance Culture, a spacious modern structure surrounded by beautifully tended gardens and an artificial lake teeming with visiting families on hot Ramadan nights. Fathers and excited children peer at tanks, fighter jets, and even missiles – relics of the bloody eight-year war launched by Saddam Hussein in 1980, a year after the Iranian revolution. But the exhibits of the unconventional, clandestine conflict over the Islamic Republic’s nuclear programme are portrayed as part of a wider – and continuing - struggle between implacable enemies. Ranged along a walkway, four green Peugeot-type saloons have been preserved under a sort of bloodstained shroud, carefully gashed to reveal pockmarked bodywork and a black-and-white photograph of a man inside. Each is flanked by a tear-shaped metal plaque with details of the victim. Red tulips, symbols of love and mourning, are strewn over the vehicles. Like other Iranian memorials, this one tends to the grandiloquent, a sign praising the “great historic confrontation of faith and heresy, and the historical movement emanating from the will and determination against the cruelty of global arrogance headed by the US and Zionism”. The scientists were all killed by agents of Israel’s intelligence agency, the Mossad, it states. “I feel very sad,” said Fateme, a young Azeri woman sitting on a bench in front of the cars. “These were fathers who went to work and never came home. I saw a programme on TV about them. And actually I went to one of their funerals. It says they were killed by the Zionist regime, but I don’t know.” The last to die was Mostafa Ahmadi Roshan, a chemist and a director of the Natanz uranium enrichment plant. He was killed in January 2012 when two men on a motorbike attached magnetic bombs to his car. Just a day earlier, the then Israeli army chief of staff, Lt Gen Benny Gantz, said that “2012 would be a critical year for Iran”, in part because of “things that happen to it unnaturally”. The first to die was Massoud Ali-Mohammadi, killed by a booby-trapped motorbike parked outside his Tehran home in January 2010. Majid Shahriari was killed and another nuclear scientist injured in a similar attack that November. The problem is not the nuclear agreement. The problem is inside Iran. Unless people want change here, it won’t come  Darioush Rezaeinejad, a student, was shot dead while driving home with his wife after picking up their daughter from kindergarten in July 2011. Iran tried and hanged an Iranian man who was said to have confessed to assassinating Ali-Mohammadi on behalf of the Mossad. All four names appear in the museum’s hologram display titled Victims of Terror, mostly listing those who were targeted before and after the 1979 revolution, many by armed opposition groups supported by Iraq. “We went through eight years of the imposed war with 188,000 martyrs,” said Seyed Salman Sober, a guide employed by Tehran municipality. “But we are displaying the names of the martyred scientists along with the martyrs of the revolution and the war to show that we still have enemies. The way they killed them in front of their houses on their way to work shows that they were not safe – even in their own country.” Fateme, like millions of her compatriots, is hoping to see a nuclear agreement emerge from the Vienna talks, despite the legacy of deep mistrust of the US. But she has begun to worry that it may not happen after this week’s warning by Barack Obama not to try to change the framework agreement reached in Lausanne in April. “Really we are suffering,” she said. Her husband lost his job in a cotton factory as the rial plummeted against the dollar two years ago. Official reverence is matched by a determination to resist too many concessions in the nuclear negotiations. Iranian officials have repeatedly claimed the scientists were assassinated after being interviewed by officials of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN’s nuclear watchdog, arguing that it cannot be trusted to carry out inspections of sensitive sites. There was no immediate comment from the IAEA on the claim that it had interviewed the targeted scientists, and the agency does not customarily reveal the names of people it talks to as part of its inspections. For Sadegh Zibakalam, a Tehran university professor and a rare public critic of the nuclear programme, the scientists’ memorial fits seamlessly into a broader Iranian narrative of resistance. “The state wants to glorify those heroic strugglers against the western powers to show that we have been through much trouble and misery and we did not give in,” he said. Still, as in any society, there are limits to respect for the dead. “Not that many people come to see these cars,” said a security guard at the museum. “In the evenings, most people go to the gardens and to the lake where there are Iranian shows. People want entertainment, and this is sad. Youth in this country are under pressure. They want to enjoy themselves. The problem is not the nuclear agreement. The problem is inside Iran . Unless people want change here, it won’t come.”"
"George Bush, Who Steered Nation in Tumultuous Times, Is Dead at 94","Advertisement Supported by By  Adam Nagourney George Bush, the 41st president of the United States and the father of the 43rd, who steered the nation through a tumultuous period in world affairs but was denied a second term after support for his presidency collapsed under the weight of an economic downturn and his seeming inattention to domestic affairs, died on Friday night at his home in Houston. He was 94. His death, which was announced by his office, came less than eight months after that of his wife of 73 years, Barbara Bush . Mr. Bush had a form of Parkinson’s disease that forced him to use a wheelchair or motorized scooter in recent years, and he had been in and out of hospitals during that time as his health declined. In April, a day after attending Mrs. Bush’s funeral, he was treated for an infection that had spread to his blood. In 2013, he was in dire enough shape with bronchitis that former President George W. Bush, his son, solicited ideas for a eulogy . But he proved resilient each time. In 2013 he told well-wishers, through an aide, to “put the harps back in the closet.” Mr. Bush, a Republican, was a transitional figure in the White House, where he served from 1989 to 1993, capping a career of more than 40 years in public service. A decorated Navy pilot who was shot down in the Pacific in 1944, he was the last of the World War II generation to occupy the Oval Office. Mr. Bush was a skilled bureaucratic and diplomatic player who, as president, helped end four decades of Cold War and the threat of nuclear engagement with a nuanced handling of the collapse of the Soviet Union and the liberation of Eastern Europe. Yet for all his success in the international arena, his presidency faltered as voters seemed to perceive him as detached from their everyday lives. In an election that turned on the economy, they repudiated Mr. Bush in 1992 and chose a relatively little-known Democratic governor from Arkansas, Bill Clinton, a baby boomer, ushering in a generational shift in American leadership. If Mr. Bush’s term helped close out one era abroad, it opened another. In January 1991 he assembled a global coalition to eject Iraqi invaders from Kuwait, sending hundreds of thousands of troops in a triumphant military campaign that to many Americans helped purge the ghosts of Vietnam. But the victory also brought years of American preoccupation with Iraq, leading to the decision by George W. Bush in 2003 to topple the Iraqi leader, Saddam Hussein, in a war that taxed American resources and patience . The elder Mr. Bush entered the White House with one of the most impressive résumés of any president. He had been a two-term congressman from Texas, ambassador to the United Nations, chairman of the Republican National Committee, United States envoy to China, director of the Central Intelligence Agency and vice president, under Ronald Reagan. And he achieved what no one had since Martin Van Buren in 1836: winning election to the presidency while serving as vice president. (Van Buren did so in the footsteps of Andrew Jackson.) A son of wealth and a graduate of Phillips Academy in Massachusetts and Yale, Mr. Bush was schooled in the good manners and graciousness of New England privilege and civic responsibility. He liked to frame his public service as an answer to the call to duty, like the one that had sent him over the Pacific and into enemy fire as a 20-year-old. (“The cockpit was full of smoke and I was choking from it,” he told his parents in a letter from the submarine that had plucked him from the sea.) He underscored the theme of duty in accepting his party’s nomination for the presidency in 1988 in New Orleans. “I am a man who sees life in terms of missions — missions defined and missions completed,” he told Republican delegates in the Louisiana Superdome, acknowledging a swell of applause. He said he would “keep America moving forward” and strive “for a better America.” 22 Photos View Slide Show › “That is my mission,” he concluded, “and I will complete it.” Tall, at 6 feet 2 inches, with an athlete’s graceful gait, Mr. Bush was genial and gentlemanly, except in the throes of a tough campaign. (Admonished by his mother against self-promotion, Mr. Bush, an inveterate note writer, in his clipped diction avoided the first person singular pronoun.) He represented a “kinder” and “gentler” strain of Republicanism — the often-quoted words he used in his Inaugural Address to describe his vision for the nation and the world — that has been all but buried in a seismic shift to the right in the party. Mr. Bush’s post-presidency brought talk of a political dynasty. The son of a United States senator, Prescott S. Bush , Mr. Bush saw two of his own sons forge political careers that brought him a measure of redemption after he was ousted as commander in chief. George W. Bush became the first son of a president since John Quincy Adams to follow his father to the White House. (Unlike the father, the son won re-election.) Another son, Jeb Bush , was twice elected governor of Florida and ran unsuccessfully for the presidency in 2016. As the elder Mr. Bush watched troubles envelop the eight-year presidency of his son, however, what had been a source of pride became a cause of distress, friends said. The contrast between the two President Bushes — 41 and 43, as they came to call each other — served to burnish the father’s reputation in later years. As the younger Mr. Bush’s popularity fell, the elder Mr. Bush’s public standing rose. Many Americans came to appreciate the restrained, seasoned leadership the 41st president had displayed; in an opinion poll in 2012, 59 percent expressed approval. Democrats, including President Barack Obama, praised the father as a way of rebuking the son. It was a subject Mr. Bush avoided discussing in public but one he finally addressed in conversations with Jon Meacham, his biographer, in a book published in 2015 . Mr. Bush was quoted as saying that his son’s administration had been harmed by a “hard line” atmosphere that pushed an aggressive and ultimately self-destructive use of force around the world, and he placed the blame for that on men who had long been part of his own life and who became key figures in his son’s orbit — Dick Cheney, his son’s vice president, and Donald H. Rumsfeld, his son’s secretary of defense, with whom the elder Mr. Bush had feuded. “I do worry about some of the rhetoric that was out there — some of it his, maybe, and some of it the people around him,” Mr. Bush said in the Meacham book, “Destiny and Power: The American Odyssey of George Herbert Walker Bush.” He was particularly critical of Mr. Rumsfeld. “I don’t like what he did, and I think it hurt the president, having his iron-ass view of everything,” he said, adding, “Rumsfeld was an arrogant fellow and self-assured, swagger.” Mr. Bush and his sons did not attend the Republican National Convention that nominated Donald J. Trump as its presidential candidate in 2016, and he pointedly did not endorse Mr. Trump in his race against Hillary Clinton. During the primary, Mr. Trump had repeatedly belittled Jeb Bush as “low energy.” Mr. Bush, who had entered the contest as the son of a president with an inside track for the nomination, was forced to withdraw by February. After his loss in 1992 to Mr. Clinton, in an election in which the billionaire independent candidate Ross Perot won almost a fifth of the vote, Mr. and Mrs. Bush repaired to their home in Houston and to their oceanfront compound in Kennebunkport, Me. By his own account the loss had left him dispirited and feeling humiliated. But he did not quite retire. He celebrated several milestone birthdays, including his 90th , with parachute jumps. He traveled the globe on White House missions, joining Mr. Clinton to raise funds for the victims of the tsunami that ravaged Asia in 2004 and of Hurricane Katrina the next year. Until these undertakings, Mr. Bush had made little effort to mask his disdain for Mr. Clinton, but they forged an unlikely, almost familial, bond, growing so close that Mrs. Bush described her husband as the father Mr. Clinton never had. The two former presidents became a symbol of bipartisanship in an increasingly partisan age. If Mr. Bush’s embrace helped scrub Mr. Clinton’s reputation of some of its tawdrier aspects, Mr. Clinton helped transform Mr. Bush’s image from that of a vanquished one-term president who had never fully escaped the shadow of his popular predecessor, Reagan, to one of a respected elder statesman. Mr. Bush was president during a shift in the world order that had begun under Reagan. His measured response to upheaval in Eastern Europe drew complaints that he was not seizing the reins of history. But he chose a collaborative approach, working with the Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev to allow for the reunification of Germany, the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War. The two leaders signed treaties mandating historic reductions in their countries’ nuclear and chemical weapons. “George H. W. Bush was the best one-term president the country has ever had, and one of the most underrated presidents of all time,” James A. Baker III, the former secretary of state and Mr. Bush’s closest adviser for nearly 50 years, said in an interview in 2013. “I think history is going to treat him very well.” In his first year at the White House, Mr. Bush sent troops into Panama to oust its strongman, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega . The rapid, relatively bloodless conclusion of the Persian Gulf war of 1991 earned him a three-minute standing ovation and shouts of “Bush! Bush!” when he addressed a joint session of Congress that March. It also sent his voter approval ratings soaring to close to 85 percent during the four-day aerial bombardment of Baghdad, according to a New York Times/CBS News poll. It was the pinnacle of his presidency, yet it lulled him, not to mention some potentially formidable Democrats, into assuming his re-election was certain. Iraq was not an unalloyed victory. Mr. Bush felt compelled to defend his decision to suspend the assault before it could topple Mr. Hussein, and his critics questioned his earlier effort to give Mr. Hussein financial aid and intelligence data. Still, foreign policy successes were the hallmark of his presidency. Not so his domestic record. By the midpoint of his term, leaders of both the Republican and Democratic Parties complained that in the midst of the worst economy any American president had faced since the end of World War II, Mr. Bush had no domestic agenda. Many questioned his sensitivity to the worries of ordinary Americans. Though stung by the criticism, he did little to dispel that perception on a visit to an economically reeling New Hampshire during his re-election campaign, when he announced in January, “Message: I care.” His signal domestic decision was almost certainly the 1990 budget deal , which sought to address deepening deficits by raising taxes on the wealthy. If it helped put the nation back on solid financial footing, it nevertheless reversed one of the most explicit campaign pledges ever uttered by a major-party presidential candidate: “ Read my lips. No new taxes.” That promise had been delivered to roars of approval in his acceptance speech at the 1988 Republican National Convention in New Orleans, and the turnabout provoked a chorus of reproach. Conservative Republicans revolted. Democrats found an opening for a bruising attack. And the stage was set for an unexpectedly strong third-party challenge by Mr. Perot, a fellow Texan who had made his fortune in computers. “It did destroy me,” Mr. Bush told Mr. Meacham years later as he assessed the damage he had suffered from breaking his 1988 campaign pledge. Barely a year after the world had hailed his success in Iraq, Mr. Bush found himself almost losing the Republican presidential primary in New Hampshire to the conservative commentator Patrick J. Buchanan. Mr. Bush won the nomination but was weakened by the Buchanan challenge and accordingly veered sharply to the right. He then lost to Mr. Clinton. Mr. Perot’s 19 percent of the popular vote helped deny both Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton a majority. By any yardstick, Mr. Bush was an aristocrat, a product of moneyed Greenwich, Conn., where he was instilled with an enduring sense of noblesse oblige. As a candidate, he was known to ask his Secret Service detail to stop at traffic lights. He wrote enough thank-you notes, courtesy cards and letters of sympathy — Mr. Bush seemed to know someone in every town in America — to fill a book, literally. That book’s title was his customary signoff, “All the Best, George Bush.” Published in 1999, it appeared in lieu of a traditional presidential memoir, which he thought would be unseemly for a man whose mother, Dorothy W. Bush , had taught him the importance of modesty. But the patrician image also hurt him politically. He drew barbs for his drawing-room mannerisms and expressions . When a waitress serving coffee at a New Hampshire truck stop during the 1988 presidential campaign asked him if he would like a refill, he nodded, saying yes, he’d have another “splash.” His critics saw him as out of touch with ordinary Americans, pointing to what they portrayed as his amazed reaction during a demonstration of a supermarket scanner when he visited a grocers’ convention while president. (He later insisted that he had not been surprised.) In a debate during the 1992 campaign , Mr. Bush became flustered when a woman asked him how he could respond to the economic distress “of the common people” if he had “no experience with what’s ailing them.” Mr. Bush gazed uneasily at his questioner. “Help me with the question, and I’ll try to answer it,” the president said. Moments afterward, he watched as Mr. Clinton strode eagerly across the stage to engage the woman and, some said, win over much of the electorate. Aware of his boarding-school image, Mr. Bush liked to point to his earthier chapters: his years in the Texas oil business, his wartime service. He reminded listeners that he did not wear button-down dress shirts or striped ties, thank you very much, and that he liked country music, horseshoes and pork rinds. His courteousness was often taken — mistaken might be the better word — for docility. In 1987, Newsweek put his picture on the cover with the headline “Fighting the ‘Wimp Factor.’ ” (“The cheapest shot I’ve seen in my political life,” Mr. Bush fumed in his diary.) But he could be fiercely competitive in both politics and play. He ran a harsh campaign to beat Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts in 1988. He did not simply play golf, he played what the White House physician called “aerobic golf,” a mad rush from green to green. Mr. Bush was given to malapropisms, a trait he may have handed down to his son George. He tangled his sentences, particularly when he was nervous. And he supplied a stream of entries into the American political lexicon. He talked about the “ Big Mo ” to describe the momentum that a victory in the Iowa caucuses had given his campaign. Tough moments were “tension city.” In asking voters not to pity him, he plucked a line from the musical “Evita,” saying , “Don’t cry for me, Argentina.” His speeches were delivered with a nasal voice and his signature clipped cadence that invited parody. The comedian Dana Carvey made his Bush imitation a staple of “Saturday Night Live.” (“Not gonna do it. Wouldn’t be prudent.”) Rarely did Mr. Bush display the kind of emotional acuity that could move an audience. In a debate in 1992, a television camera captured him glancing at his wristwatch , as if he were bored. Yet for all these moments, Mr. Bush could exhibit a gracious charm and authenticity. He was that rare figure in Washington: a man without enemies — or with very few, at any rate. “You don’t see anybody trashing this president,” Mr. Baker said in the 2013 interview. “Whether they agreed with him on certain policy positions or not, people respected him and liked him.” Besides his sons George and Jeb, Mr. Bush is survived by two other sons, Neil and Marvin; his daughter, Dorothy Bush Koch; a brother, Jonathan; a sister, Nancy Walker Bush Ellis; 17 grandchildren; and eight great-grandchildren. Another daughter, Robin, died of leukemia at age 3 in 1953. His older brother, Prescott S. Bush Jr., died in 2010 at 87, and his younger brother, William, died in March at 79. Mr. Bush remained physically and mentally robust well into his later years, pursuing a retirement seemingly as active as his career had been. At Kennebunkport, when not golfing, he could be found piloting his speedboat, grinning as it roared atop the waves while often terrifying passengers who had dared to join him. The day before he turned 80, in 2004, he gave a eulogy at Reagan’s funeral in California. Back in Texas two days later, he celebrated his birthday with about 5,000 invited guests, including Mr. Gorbachev, at a gala dinner in Houston’s baseball stadium. The day after that, as 3,000 people watched from below, Mr. Bush strapped on a parachute and jumped out of a plane. George Herbert Walker Bush — he was named after his mother’s father, George Herbert Walker — was born on June 12, 1924, the second of five children, in Milton, Mass., outside Boston. His family moved to Greenwich soon after. His father, besides his two terms in the United States Senate, was a banker who commuted to Wall Street as a managing partner at Brown Brothers Harriman , the white-shoe investment firm. His mother, the former Dorothy Walker, was a native of Maine. It was she who gave George his nickname, Poppy, when he was a toddler. The children grew up sheltered from the Depression, tended to by maids and a driver. George enrolled at Greenwich Country Day School and Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass. They spent summers in Kennebunkport. Mr. Bush’s high school yearbook testifies to his ambitions and energy: He was president of the senior class, chairman of the student deacons and captain of both the baseball team and the soccer team. If his father set the tone for Mr. Bush’s career, his mother shaped his values. His daughter, Ms. Koch, wrote in a memoir that he had been admonished to eschew self-promotion. “ ‘Nobody likes the big I am, George,’ my grandmother would say to him,” Ms. Koch wrote. “ ‘Don’t be talking about yourself.’ ” Mr. Bush once boasted to his mother that he had scored three goals in a soccer match. “That’s nice, George,” his mother replied, “but how did the team do?” Six months before he graduated from Phillips Academy, the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor. “I could hardly wait to get out of school and enlist,” he wrote years later. At 18, a handsome and strapping young man, Mr. Bush did enlist, as a seaman second class in the Navy’s flight training program. Soon he was flying combat missions in the Pacific. In September 1944, on a bombing run from the aircraft carrier San Jacinto, his plane was hit near the island of Chichi Jima by antiaircraft guns. He looked out and saw the wings on fire. “I headed the plane out to sea and put on the throttle so as we could get away from the land as much as possible,” he told his parents in a letter. “I turned the plane up in an attitude so as to take the pressure off the back hatch so the boys could get out. After that I straightened up and started to get out myself.” Two men on the plane died in the attack. Mr. Bush hit his head bailing out, he said, but landed safely in the ocean. He floated on a raft for hours, “violently sick to my stomach,” until a submarine rescued him. He was awarded a Distinguished Flying Cross. He returned home on Christmas Eve 1944. Days later, he married a young woman he had met at a dance three years earlier: Barbara Pierce, the daughter of Marvin Pierce, the publisher of Redbook and McCall’s magazines. Discharged from the Navy as a lieutenant junior grade, Mr. Bush enrolled at Yale, where he was admitted to the exclusive Skull and Bones club. With the arrival of the couple’s first child, their apartment in New Haven became the home of two future presidents. After graduating from Yale in 1948 with a degree in economics, Mr. Bush took his red 1947 Studebaker — a graduation present from his parents — and drove to Odessa, Tex. A wealthy family friend, Henry Neil Mallon, gave him an entry-level job at his Texas oil company, Dresser Industries , landing him in a state that he barely knew but that would become a part of his political identity. But Mr. Bush grew bored in the job, and in 1951 he and a Texas entrepreneur formed an oil exploration business. Two years later, with the business struggling, they merged with another company to form Zapata Petroleum . Zapata had a reputation for never drilling a dry hole, and before long Mr. Bush had made his first million. By 1963 he was living in Houston, and his thoughts turned to politics. There was a contest to lead the Harris County Republican committee, and, by his account, local Republicans pressed him to jump in to prevent the far-right John Birch Society from taking over. Night after night Mr. Bush drove across the county to make speeches, with Mrs. Bush typically sitting behind him onstage, crocheting. He won, and the victory caught the attention of state Republican leaders, who urged him to challenge Senator Ralph Yarborough, a Democrat seeking a second term in 1964. Mr. Bush agreed. It was not the easiest way to begin a career in elective politics. Mr. Yarborough had ridden in President John F. Kennedy’s motorcade at the time of the assassination in Dallas the previous year, and the new president, Lyndon B. Johnson, a fellow Texan who was heading for a landslide election victory, supported him. Mr. Yarborough tried to discredit Mr. Bush by tying him to Barry M. Goldwater , the conservative Arizona senator and overmatched Republican presidential candidate. Mr. Bush did not resist the association. He criticized the Civil Rights Act that was before Congress, denounced the 1963 nuclear test ban treaty and warned of a welfare state. He lost, but his 43 percent of the vote was hardly embarrassing in a still decidedly Democratic state. In February 1966, Mr. Bush resigned as chairman and chief executive of Zapata to run for Congress in a wealthy Houston district. Surveying his electorate, he began moving to the center; he now spoke well of the Johnson agenda, declaring in a speech, “I generally favor the goals as outlined in the Great Society.” He told his minister: “I took some of the far-right positions to get elected. I hope I never do it again. I regret it.” Mr. Bush won the House seat handily, with 67 percent of the vote. In Washington, he was one of 47 Republican freshmen in a Democratic-controlled Congress. In his telling, his most consequential vote there was for the open housing bill of 1968, an extension of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which he had campaigned against. He still had concerns about the act’s constitutionality, he wrote about his evolution, but the “problem of discrimination troubled me deeply.” Mr. Bush was re-elected without opposition in 1968. The next spring, President Richard M. Nixon encouraged him to challenge Mr. Yarborough again for a Senate seat, although it would mean giving up a safe House seat and a post on the Ways and Means Committee. With Mr. Yarborough appearing more vulnerable this time, Mr. Bush took the challenge for the 1970 election. Once again things did not turn out as planned. Representative Lloyd Bentsen challenged Mr. Yarborough in the Democratic primary and, in an upset, won. Mr. Bush, suddenly confronting a much tougher opponent, lost by more than 150,000 votes. Twice defeated as a Senate candidate, and with his term in the House about to expire, Mr. Bush was looking for work. He was shortly summoned to the White House, where H. R. Haldeman , Nixon’s chief of staff, talked to him about a White House staff job. Mr. Bush, however, wanted to be the United States ambassador to the United Nations. Nixon agreed. His nomination drew a tide of criticism — his qualifications, as a former two-term congressman, were not immediately apparent — but Mr. Bush won confirmation in February 1971. His United Nations service began with an embittering defeat in a vote on whether to seat a delegation from China. The United States had wanted both Taiwan and the People’s Republic of China to be represented, but the United Nations General Assembly voted to expel Taiwan to make way for China. Delegates danced in the aisles, delighted to see the United States humiliated. When Mr. Bush rose to speak, he was hissed. “Gladiatorial ugliness at its worst,” he later called it. In 1972, after the break-ins at the Democratic Party offices at the Watergate Hotel in Washington, Nixon had a more urgent need for Mr. Bush: to lead the Republican National Committee. He took the job, he wrote, certain of Nixon’s innocence in the scandal, and he defended Nixon, though it was not easy. Meeting with editors and reporters of The Washington Post at the newspaper’s offices, he talked about the pressures he felt even from within his own party. “I had two stacks of mail,” he said. The first asked, “How come you’re not doing more to support the president?” The second asked, “How come you’re keeping the party so close to the president?” But as the scandal deepened, his support for Nixon began to erode, particularly after the Supreme Court ordered the president to turn over 64 tapes, including one that recorded him ordering Mr. Haldeman to block an F.B.I. inquiry into the break-ins. “This was proof the president had lied,” Mr. Bush wrote in “All the Best, George Bush.” “The man is amoral,” he said of Nixon in his diary. After Nixon resigned , ceding the presidency to Vice President Gerald R. Ford , Mr. Bush hoped to fill the vice president’s office. Ford called him in Kennebunkport two weeks later to tell him that he had chosen former Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller of New York for the job. Mr. Bush went instead to China, as head of the United States Liaison Office, serving as an unofficial ambassador at a time when the two countries did not have full diplomatic relations. He would describe the period as a sabbatical, free of stress and obligations. Ford brought him back for another assignment in 1976: to lead the C.I.A., which was still reeling from accusations that it had abused its power under Nixon, including plotting to assassinate foreign leaders and overturn governments. Mr. Bush was credited with restoring morale at the agency, but it was another short-lived appointment, lasting just under a year. Ford lost the election to Jimmy Carter that November, and Mr. Bush returned to Texas. There he turned his sights toward running for president. “I am determined to make an all-out effort for 1980,” he wrote to Nixon in January 1979. Mr. Bush put together a cabinet of advisers — including Mr. Baker, a Houston lawyer who had managed his 1970 Senate campaign and Ford’s 1976 presidential campaign — and began traveling the country. He focused first on the Iowa caucuses, borrowing from Jimmy Carter’s strategy in 1976 of using a victory there to jump ahead of the field. He succeeded in Iowa, but then lost in New Hampshire, and by May the party was coalescing around Reagan. Mr. Bush met with his advisers. “A consensus was reached — the campaign had no future,” he wrote in his autobiography. “There was only one dissenting voice. Mine.” Mr. Bush decided on a new goal: to become vice president. But that July he learned from television that Reagan was seeking to enlist Ford. To ask a former president to take the No. 2 spot was a surprising move, but Reagan, a former actor and California governor with hard-right views, hoped that Ford would bring to the ticket both Washington heft and political moderation. Their negotiation faltered, however, and Mr. Bush received the telephone call he had wanted. “Hello, George,” Reagan said to Mr. Bush. “This is Ron Reagan. I’d like to go over to the convention and announce that you’re my choice for vice president, if that’s all right with you.” That November, the Reagan-Bush ticket won in a landslide and Mr. Bush offered the new president his fealty. “I will never do anything to embarrass you politically,” he wrote to Reagan. Mr. Bush happily accepted his first assignment: leading a task force to reduce federal regulations. He rarely, if ever, said no to attending the funeral of a foreign dignitary, and he endured the ribbing that is the cost of being a vice president. “Let ’em laugh,” Mr. Bush said. “There’s a lot going on, and it’s substantive, and I like it.” The Reagan-Bush team was even more convincing in the 1984 re-election campaign, when the Democratic challenger, former Vice President Walter F. Mondale, chose as his running mate Representative Geraldine A. Ferraro , the first woman nominated for national office by a major party. She and Mr. Bush sparred throughout the campaign, and he came in for criticism when he was overheard after a debate bragging that “we tried to kick a little ass last night.” But almost as soon as the votes began piling up, he turned to his own political future. Early in 1986, wanting to shore up his shaky credentials on the right, Mr. Bush gave a series of speeches in which he backed constitutional amendments supporting a balanced budget and school prayer and restricting abortion. He also tied himself ever more tightly to Reagan by presenting himself as the rightful heir to his party’s presidential nomination. But the risks in that strategy became all too apparent. With the exposure of the Iran-contra affair — the clandestine scheme to sell arms to Iran in exchange for the release of Iranian hostages and then to divert the proceeds to right-wing Nicaraguan rebels — the White House came under investigation, and Mr. Bush was hounded by questions about what he knew about the deal. He said he had expressed “certain reservations” about it in White House meetings, a recollection that at one point Reagan seemed to challenge. The arms-for-hostages storm hurt Mr. Bush and emboldened his Republican opponents. In January 1988, when Mr. Bush faced an unexpectedly tough challenge in Iowa from Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, an interview with the CBS News anchor Dan Rather turned into a 10-minute confrontation . Mr. Rather pressed Mr. Bush about his role in the Iran-contra affair. “I want to talk about why I want to be president,” Mr. Bush said. “I don’t think it’s fair to judge my whole career by a rehash on Iran.” Mr. Bush came in third in the Iowa caucuses, behind Mr. Dole and the evangelical preacher Pat Robertson. It was an embarrassment for a vice president in office and the presumed heir to the nomination. Stung, Mr. Bush turned his hopes to New Hampshire, where his campaign was being run by Gov. John H. Sununu. Mr. Sununu advised him to counter his image as a man of privilege. Soon the president was campaigning in a windbreaker, pumping hands at factory gates and, at one point, leaping from his motorcade to help a driver stuck in a snowbank. Mr. Bush won the New Hampshire primary with 37.8 percent of the vote, and Mr. Dole ended his dwindling chances that night when he flashed anger in a television interview . When the NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw asked Mr. Dole if he had anything to say to Mr. Bush, he responded by saying, “Stop lying about my record.” By the spring, Mr. Bush had pivoted toward the Democratic field, where Mr. Dukakis had emerged as the party’s choice. The Bush camp decided to portray Mr. Dukakis as a Massachusetts liberal, highlighting his membership in the American Civil Liberties Union and his having supported a program that provided a weekend furlough to a prisoner, Willie Horton , who had raped a woman while free from jail one weekend. When Mr. Bush arrived in New Orleans for the Republican convention, Mr. Dukakis had a 17-point lead in opinion polls. Mr. Bush did not get off to the most auspicious start. Even some Republicans questioned his choice for running mate: Dan Quayle, a young, boyish-looking, little-known Indiana senator who was just finishing his first term. But Mr. Bush was focused on his opponent. He mocked Mr. Dukakis for being a “card-carrying member of the A.C.L.U.” and attacked him for refusing to sign a Massachusetts bill mandating that teachers lead students in a daily recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. Bush pulled ahead of Mr. Dukakis in the polls. As Election Day neared, Mr. Dukakis faded under the pummeling of a campaign that even some Republicans would characterize as ugly. Lee Atwater, who had directed the campaign, apologized in 1991 for the tactics he had employed. The day before the election, Mr. Bush was confident enough about the outcome that he decided to name Mr. Baker, his campaign manager in 1970 and 1980, as secretary of state and Mr. Sununu, who had saved his candidacy in New Hampshire, as chief of staff. His victory, on Nov. 8, was convincing: He won 40 states and 54 percent of the popular vote, to Mr. Dukakis’s 46 percent. The next day, seeking to distance himself from harsher sides of his campaign, Mr. Bush assured reporters that they would never again see the candidate some had begun calling George the Ripper. Denied the presidency earlier and overshadowed by Reagan for eight years, Mr. Bush was triumphant as he stood at the West Front of the Capitol on Inauguration Day in January 1989, a throng of well-wishers spread out below. He was 64 years old and eager to move into the office down the hall and around the corner from the quarters he had occupied as vice president — so eager that he exclaimed “I” before Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist had finished asking him if he would solemnly swear to faithfully execute the office of president. In his Inaugural Address , Mr. Bush pledged “to make kinder the face of the nation and gentler the face of the world.” He talked about a “thousand points of light,” a reference to community and charitable groups, “spread like stars throughout the nation.” But he soon met obstacles to that lofty ambition — some political, some economic, some of his own doing and some beyond his control. The most immediate difficulty came from operating in Reagan’s shadow. Mr. Bush had replaced, and would be judged against, a two-term president who had come to embody a new era of Republicanism while presiding over what was, at the time, the longest period of economic growth in history. If things went wrong for Mr. Bush, he would not be able to blame his predecessor. And clearly he did not approve of everything Reagan had done as president. The heavy budget deficit Reagan had left promised to complicate anything the new president might want to do. Mr. Bush also faced a solidly Democratic Congress, a disadvantage he would later blame for his limited legislative record . And although Mr. Bush had defeated Mr. Dukakis soundly, he was not feared; Democrats were not inclined to afford him much of a ride. Mr. Bush’s first test came with his nomination of an old ally, John G. Tower , as secretary of defense. Mr. Tower, a former senator from Texas, had served on the Senate Armed Services Committee, and Mr. Bush thought the nomination would, as he wrote, “glide through the Hill for two good reasons: He was more than qualified for the job, and Congress is usually kind to its own. “I could not have been more wrong.” The problems rose from the right. Paul M. Weyrich , an uncompromising leader of the conservative movement, testified before the committee that he had seen Mr. Tower inebriated in public and in the company of women other than his wife. Mr. Weyrich said he had “serious reservations” about Mr. Tower’s “moral character.” The next day, Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who was chairman of the committee, asked Mr. Tower if he had a drinking problem. “I have none, senator,” Mr. Tower said. But the nomination was sliding off the tracks , and Mr. Bush responded with fury, denouncing what he called the “frenzied air of speculation” about Mr. Tower. He and Mr. Quayle began lobbying senators personally. The Senate voted 53 to 47 to reject Mr. Tower’s nomination. It was the first time in 30 years that a president had been denied his choice of a cabinet member. Mr. Bush next nominated a popular House member for the defense secretary job: Mr. Cheney of Wyoming. But the Tower episode had taken a toll. The 41st president had not reached the benchmark first 100 days in office, yet he felt compelled to declare that his White House was “on track.” “I would simply resist the clamor that nothing seems to be bubbling around, that nothing is happening,” he said. “A lot is happening, not all of it good, but a lot is happening.” In the spring, the Bush presidency turned to foreign affairs, where it stayed for much of the next two years. In Panama, Mr. Noriega claimed victory in an election in May that independent observers said had been stained with fraud. Mr. Bush declared the election stolen and called for international pressure to make the Panamanian strongman step aside. It would take almost eight months to accomplish that goal. The Soviet bloc was in even greater upheaval. Mr. Gorbachev, who had come to power in 1985, had begun a campaign for economic and democratic change, shaking the foundations of communism across Eastern Europe. Mr. Bush found himself under pressure to respond with equal boldness. In April 1989, he went to a Polish enclave in Michigan to salute the Polish government for its political liberalization, including providing for the labor union Solidarity to regain its legal status. “The winds of change are shaping a new European destiny,” Mr. Bush said. It was time, he declared in Texas a few weeks later, to “seek the integration of the Soviet Union into the community of nations.” And at a NATO meeting in May in Brussels, where many world leaders wanted to see if he could hold his own, he presented Mr. Gorbachev with a proposal for conventional arms cuts. Still, Mr. Bush was criticized , even by allies, for having responded tentatively and tepidly to developments behind the Iron Curtain. After the Berlin Wall came down in November 1989, reporters asked Mr. Bush why he seemed subdued. “I’m just not an emotional kind of guy,” he replied. He bristled at the criticism. “If we mishandle this,” he said, speaking of the rebellions in Eastern Europe, “and get way out looking like an American project, you could invite crackdown and invite negative reaction that could result in bloodshed.” Mr. Bush had been similarly cautious in June that year, when Chinese troops cracked down on students demonstrating around Tiananmen Square in Beijing and opened fire, killing hundreds. He announced sanctions against China but said he did not want to cut off diplomatic relations. That fall, Mr. Bush announced that he and Mr. Gorbachev would meet, albeit with no formal agenda, on vessels off the coast of Malta, in the Mediterranean. The summit meeting took place in early December 1989. Rough waters forced the cancellation of a negotiating session, but when the seas abated, the two leaders met and vowed to conclude treaties on long-range nuclear weapons and conventional arms by the end of the next year. They agreed, Mr. Gorbachev said, that “the characteristics of the Cold War should be abandoned.” At the time, Mr. Bush was frustrated by Mr. Noriega’s resilience. In October, dissident Panamanian defense forces had been crushed in an attempted coup that received some, but not enough, American support. Mr. Noriega appeared before cameras in a taunting show of defiance. On Dec. 20, the United States invaded Panama in a swift overnight operation involving 11,000 troops; 23 Americans died. Mr. Noriega fled, eventually turning up at the residence of the Vatican’s representative in Panama City before surrendering to the United States to face narcotics-trafficking charges. Mr. Atwater, the chairman of the Republican National Committee at the time, said the capture was a “political jackpot” for Mr. Bush. Through all of this, Mr. Bush, trying to establish a presidential identity distinct from Reagan’s, was moving away from his predecessor’s policies. He slowed spending on the missile defense shield and the Strategic Defense Initiative (known as Star Wars), and delayed production of the Stealth bomber. He proposed a tougher Clean Air Act to curb major sources of hazardous air pollution, including emissions from coal-burning power plants. And he agreed to send humanitarian aid, but not military aid, to the Nicaraguan contras, the rebels fighting the leftist Sandinista government . Mr. Bush also negotiated and signed the landmark Americans With Disabilities Act , largely fulfilling a 1988 campaign pledge. Nearly 3,000 people, many in wheelchairs, attended the White House signing. “Let the shameful walls of exclusion finally come tumbling down,” he said. Supporters of the bill called it the most significant piece of civil rights legislation in two decades. It barred discrimination against people with handicaps in places of public accommodation, transportation and employment, and mandated that many new public and private buildings be made easily accessible to people with disabilities. Similar rules applied to buses and trains. Environmental groups praised Mr. Bush’s record on climate change and the environment. As president, he signed the United States to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1992, which led to the Paris Agreement on a plan to reduce global emissions. Mr. Bush also created the U.S. Global Change Research Program, the federal body that produces a sweeping government climate change report every four years. Mr. Bush’s popularity and spirits were soaring when he stepped before Congress for his first State of the Union address, in January 1990. He used the speech to hail what he called the “revolution of ’89,” with “changes so striking that it marks the beginning of a new era in the world’s affairs.” In the spring, Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev concluded a summit meeting in Washington with broad agreements to commit to reduce arsenals of long-range nuclear weapons and to eliminate most of their chemical weapons. On the domestic front, Mr. Bush was ready to negotiate a deal on the growing budget deficit. But in doing so he opened the door to what he would come to see as the worst mistake of his presidency. “We need a deal,” he wrote in his diary. “I’m willing to eat crow, but the others are going to have to eat crow. I’ll have to yield on ‘Read My Lips,’ and they’re going to have to yield on some of their rhetoric on taxes and on entitlements.” Marlin Fitzwater, the White House press secretary at the time, said the administration had “no preconditions” as it entered negotiations with congressional leaders. But Democrats, seeking to guard against Republican attacks in elections that fall, said they would not consider any tax increases unless Mr. Bush publicly endorsed such a step. The White House issued a statement by the president on June 26. “It is clear to me,” it said, “that both the size of the deficit problem and the need for a package that can be enacted require all of the following.” There was a short list of actions. One was “tax revenue increases.” Mr. Bush and congressional Democrats agreed on a budget proposal that included raising taxes on gasoline, cigarettes, liquor and luxury items. The reaction was scathing. “The president gave away the crown jewel of his campaign promise to bring the Democrats to the table: That was ‘no new taxes,’ ” said Representative Duncan Hunter, Republican of California. The House voted down the budget proposal, 254 to 179, in October 1990. It took several weeks to reach a final deal, which included raising the tax rate on upper income earners to 31 percent from 28 percent. Mr. Bush said that he would sign it, but that he was “absolutely going to hold the line on taxes from now on.” In the early hours of Aug. 2, 1990, Iraqi forces under the command of Saddam Hussein rumbled into Kuwait and seized its oil fields. “This is radical Saddam Hussein moving,” Mr. Bush wrote in his diary as he sat in the Oval Office at 6 a.m. In an address to the nation a few days later, Mr. Bush signaled that the United States was prepared to respond with force. “This will not stand,” he said . Over the next two weeks, Mr. Bush moved the nation toward war while trying to reassure leaders like Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain, who told him, “Don’t go wobbly on me, George.” He sent paratroopers to Saudi Arabia and ordered warships to the Persian Gulf to enforce United Nations trade sanctions against Iraq. From the start, Mr. Bush was dubious that Mr. Hussein would respond to diplomacy. But while Mrs. Thatcher was trying to steel him, other European allies, as well as Mr. Gorbachev and Democrats in Congress, were pressuring him not to act too aggressively. Mr. Bush pressed his case, saying publicly that he wanted to avoid a military solution, while preparing for just that. “Vital issues of principle are at stake,” he declared to Congress on Sept. 11. “Saddam Hussein is literally trying to wipe a country off the face of the earth.” In November, Mr. Bush nearly doubled the size of the United States presence in the Persian Gulf. Democrats in Congress were concerned. “Howling in the Congress was loud,” Gen. Colin L. Powell, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Mr. Bush, wrote in his memoir. “Was this George Bush, whom some people criticized as a ‘wimp,’ trying to prove his manhood by starting a war? The United Nations Security Council passed a resolution at the end of November authorizing the use of force against Iraq if it did not leave Kuwait by Jan. 15, 1991. It did not. On Jan. 12, the House and Senate, with bipartisan support, authorized military action in the Persian Gulf. By then Mr. Bush had built a foundation for it: 28 countries, including Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the Soviet Union, were behind him. At 3 a.m. in Iraq on Jan. 16, after a midnight deadline had passed without an Iraqi withdrawal, Mr. Bush ordered airstrikes. Waves of bombers and cruise missiles hit Baghdad and targets elsewhere in Iraq and in Kuwait. “Our goal is not the conquest of Iraq, it is the liberation of Kuwait,” Mr. Bush said in a televised address. Mr. Hussein proclaimed that the “mother of all battles has begun.” The war began with a spectacular display of United States air power, as precision missile and bombing runs appeared to be inflicting grave damage on Baghdad. The White House held out hope that this assault alone would win the war, without American casualties, but Pentagon officials realized that a ground invasion was inevitable. When it came, the ground war lasted almost exactly 100 hours, with minimal American casualties. Encircled, the Iraqi Army surrendered. Mr. Bush called a cease-fire, even though it allowed members of the Republican Guard, an elite Iraqi unit, to escape, and even though it left Mr. Hussein in power. General Powell advised Mr. Bush to end the fighting. “Mr. President, it’s going much better than we expected,” he recalled saying, according to his memoir. “The Iraqi Army is broken. All they’re trying to do now is get out. We don’t want to be seen as killing for the sake of killing.” Mr. Bush, by General Powell’s account, responded, “If that’s the case, why not end it today?” Mr. Bush would be called to defend that decision time and again, saying that he had been convinced that Mr. Hussein would be overthrown once the war ended. “We underestimated his brutality and cruelty to his own people and the stranglehold he has on his country,” Mr. Bush wrote in February 1991, years before Mr. Hussein was actually ousted. “We were disappointed, but I still do not regret my decision to end the war when we did.” In the next six months, Mr. Bush balanced urgent demands both abroad and at home. He went to Moscow in July 1991 and signed the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty , which slashed the American and Soviet long-range nuclear arsenals by 25 percent to 35 percent. But Mr. Gorbachev was losing his battle to hold on to power. Less than three weeks later, Mr. Bush’s loyalty was put to the test when Mr. Gorbachev, his country in economic turmoil, was ousted by hard-liners . Mr. Bush denounced the coup as a “misguided and illegitimate effort” and demanded that Mr. Gorbachev be returned to power. For Mr. Bush, it was an uncharacteristically risky move, considering what might have happened to United States-Soviet relations had the generals behind the coup succeeded. The takeover did not last the week. But the disintegration of the Soviet Union was nearly complete. Mr. Gorbachev stepped down on Dec. 25. In Washington, Mr. Bush nominated Judge Clarence Thomas , a 43-year-old United States appeals court judge for the District of Columbia Circuit, to fill the Supreme Court seat left vacant by the retirement of Justice Thurgood Marshall, a champion of civil rights and the first black person to serve on that bench. Judge Thomas, who is also black, soon faced questions about his conservative ideology and accusations of sexual harassment by a former aide, Anita F. Hill. The White House responded by trying to discredit Ms. Hill, and after a pitched battle with Congress, the Senate confirmed Judge Thomas by a vote of 52 to 48, one of the narrowest margins ever for a Supreme Court nomination. (It was a far more contentious nomination than Mr. Bush’s choice of David H. Souter, who had been confirmed by the Senate, 90 to 9, the year before.) The 1992 election was still more than a year away, but Mr. Bush was considering his prospects for a second term when he took note of a governor who sought to run against him. “The stories keep saying I will be very hard to beat: The more we hear of this, the more worried I become,” he wrote in his diary. “Bill Clinton, a very nice man, may get into the race.” Then came an Election Day jolt in 1991: Harris Wofford, an obscure Democrat running for the Senate in Pennsylvania and appealing to the economic concerns of the middle class, defeated Dick Thornburgh, an attorney general under both Mr. Bush and Reagan. The next day, Mr. Bush canceled a trip to the Far East, wary of giving Democrats ammunition in portraying him as interested only in foreign policy. He summoned reporters to say the economy was basically sound . “You see, there’s some fairly good fundamentals getting out there,” he said. “Inflation is down. Interest rates are down. Personal debt is down. Inventories are down.” But Americans, including Republicans, were dubious. One opinion poll found that only one in four respondents approved of Mr. Bush’s handling of the economy. Signaling more trouble, Mr. Buchanan, the conservative commentator, announced that he would challenge Mr. Bush for the Republican nomination. Mr. Bush’s 12-day trip to the Far East opened the last full year of his presidency. The White House presented the trip, six weeks before the New Hampshire primary, as an effort to open export markets. Instead it produced what Mr. Bush saw as one of the most damaging moments of his time in office. At a state dinner in Tokyo hosted by Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, Mr. Bush turned white, vomited on his host and fainted . Mr. Miyazawa cradled Mr. Bush’s head as the president crumpled to the floor, an unsettling image that dominated the news for days. Mr. Bush came home to a bleak domestic picture. Unemployment was at 7.1 percent, the highest level in six years. A New York Times/CBS News opinion poll found that just one-fifth of Americans thought Mr. Bush cared about their problems. When Mr. Bush visited New Hampshire in mid-January, his anxiety was evident the moment he stepped off Air Force One. “I probably have made mistakes in assessing the fact that the economy would recover,” he said. “I think I’ve known, look, this economy is in free fall. I hope I’ve known it. Maybe I haven’t conveyed it as well as I should have, but I do understand it.” Mr. Buchanan drew 37 percent of the vote in New Hampshire, unwelcome news for the beleaguered Mr. Bush. The president’s advisers promptly sent him to 22 cities in 20 days. He attacked welfare, big government and trial lawyers, and rued the day he had agreed to raise taxes, calling his decision to renege on his tax pledge the biggest mistake of his presidency. Mr. Bush stopped his slide by solidly beating Mr. Buchanan in South Carolina. Clearly relieved, the president said he would cut back his campaign trips. But Mr. Buchanan’s candidacy had highlighted Mr. Bush’s political frailty, forced him to act as a candidate rather than as a president, and pushed him rightward as Mr. Clinton seized the center. There was little respite for Mr. Bush as he prepared for the nominating convention in Houston. At that point he had to deal with the prospect of a populist third-party challenge from Mr. Perot. Mr. Bush shrugged off the threat at first. “Perot will be defined, seen, as a weirdo,” he wrote that spring, referring to Mr. Perot’s eccentric ways and folksy style. (He was drawn to conspiracy theories, among other things, and hired private detectives to chase his suspicions.) But Mr. Perot had captured the public’s imagination. He presented himself as the symbol of change and did not play by the rules of traditional politics. Alarmed Republicans were blunt. At a fund-raiser in Charlotte, N.C., the president was visibly uncomfortable watching a video in which Senator Jesse Helms complained about Mr. Bush’s campaign. “Mr. President,” Mr. Helms said, “tell them once again, ‘Read my lips,’ but this time with gusto.” Mr. Bush fixated on Mr. Clinton’s political skills. Mr. Clinton was “better at facts-figures, than I am,” he wrote to an adviser. “I am better at life.” He also complained to supporters that he was not getting the credit he deserved for the fall of communism, the handling of the Persian Gulf war and the arms control treaties. “I have worked my heart out as president of the United States,” he said. Mr. Clinton was nominated by a confident, united Democratic Party in New York in July. Republicans went on the attack, portraying him as a man of character flaws that made him unfit to lead. Mr. Clinton responded with equal force. “George Bush,” he said, “if you won’t use your power to help people, step aside. I will.” Mr. Clinton’s convention was a success. In a New York Times/CBS News opinion poll, he had the biggest postconvention bounce in 50 years, leading Mr. Bush 55 percent to 31 percent. Republicans despaired. Under pressure to shake up his White House, Mr. Bush pressed his old friend Mr. Baker to leave the State Department and return as White House chief of staff. Mr. Bush accepted the nomination to run for a second term with a promise to cut taxes, a pledge to curb spending, an attack on Mr. Clinton’s credentials and — once again — an apology for having broken his tax cut pledge. “Who do you trust in this election?” he said as Republican delegates in Houston roared their approval. “The candidate who raised taxes one time and regrets it, or the other candidate, who raised taxes and fees 128 times and enjoyed it every time?” The convention was dominated by angry appeals to the party’s conservative wing, notably by Mr. Buchanan and Mr. Robertson, who were given prime-time slots to speak against abortion rights and gay rights. By the end of the month, a New York Times/CBS News poll showed that Mr. Clinton still had a resounding lead of 51 percent to 26 percent. Mr. Bush remained ostensibly confident. “I can make it; I can out hustle Clinton; out work him; out jog him; out campaign him; and we’ll win,” he wrote in his diary. But his campaign was frantic. He jumped from offering an economic plan one day to attacking Mr. Clinton’s character the next, referring to Mr. Clinton’s military draft exemptions, his dabbling with marijuana and his protests against the Vietnam War while a student. Mr. Bush’s attacks escalated as the weather turned cold. “My dog Millie knows more about foreign affairs than those two bozos,” he said of Mr. Clinton and his running mate, Senator Al Gore of Tennessee. But on Nov. 3, Mr. Clinton defeated Mr. Bush, 43 percent to 37 percent, with Mr. Perot drawing almost 19 percent. Mr. Bush believed he would have won were it not for Mr. Perot, Mr. Baker said. That weekend, a dispirited Mr. Bush retreated with General Powell to Camp David in Maryland, where they watched the movie “Enchanted April” and tried to understand what had just happened. “I just never thought they’d elect him,” Mr. Bush told General Powell. “Don’t understand it. But life goes on.” Mr. Bush had not expected such an early retirement. He and Mrs. Bush did not even really have a place to go: Their base in Houston was a hotel suite, and the Kennebunkport retreat had not been winterized. But Mr. Bush was not finished with his presidency. At Christmas, he pardoned six Reagan administration officials who had been involved in the arms-for-hostages scandal. One, former Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger , was about to stand trial on charges that he had lied to Congress about his knowledge of arms sales to Iran. The trial would have opened up private notes referring to Mr. Bush’s support for the secret arms shipment. The special prosecutor in the case, Lawrence E. Walsh , assailed the pardons. “The Iran-contra cover-up, which has continued for more than six years, has now been completed,” he said. Mr. Bush returned to Russia for a final foreign policy triumph. He and President Boris N. Yeltsin signed a Start II agreement providing for the steepest rollback of nuclear arms yet. Then, on Jan. 20, 1993, Mr. Bush took one last walk around the White House grounds. Mr. Bush spent the rest of his life more as an observer than as a player, watching as one son was elected president twice and as another was elected governor twice before attempting his own run for the presidency. He joined Mr. Clinton in raising money for disaster relief efforts. His public profile dropped as criticism of his son’s presidency mounted, and there were reports that foreign policy advisers to the elder Mr. Bush had counseled against the war in Iraq that so troubled George W. Bush’s presidency. As Mr. Bush moved into the final years of his life, there were signs that time had left him behind. A handful of women accused him of inappropriately touching them as they were having their pictures taken with him. Mr. Bush’s office said the gestures, he patted them on the rear, were meant in a good-natured manner, but said: “to anyone he has offended, President Bush apologizes most sincerely.” Mr. Bush was never a man comfortable with self-examination, but in an interview with Mr. Meacham, his biographer, he evinced some insecurity about how history might judge him. “I am lost between the glory of Reagan — monuments everywhere, trumpets, the great hero — and the trials and tribulations of my sons,” Mr. Bush said. At another point, he asked of those who would examine his career, “What if they just find an empty deck of cards?” But the 41st president may have best summed up his talents and ambitions in a diary entry on the last day of 1989, as the first year of his presidency drew to a close. “I’m certainly not seen as visionary,” Mr. Bush wrote. “But I hope I’m seen as steady and prudent and able.” An earlier version of this obituary misstated the percentage of the popular vote that Michael Dukakis won in the 1988 presidential election. It was 46 percent, not 35 percent. Peter Baker and Manny Fernandez contributed reporting. Advertisement"
"Iran's economy plagued by structural problems","Public expectations in the Islamic Republic of an economic upturn after the nuclear agreement are not being met Tehran Bureau correspondent  Mon 2 Nov 2015 07.00 GMT   Last modified on Tue 3 Nov 2015 10.35 GMT   It’s 10pm and Elham, a 45-year-old mother of two, is driving her car looking for passengers. She was recently laid off from her full-time job and now has to work as an unofficial taxi driver. “They fooled us all for two years, saying the [nuclear] deal is imminent,” she mumbled while driving. “For two years they told us to be patient, saying after the deal Iran will turn into heaven, sanctions will be lifted. What happened to all those promises?” More than two years into the administration of President Hassan Rouhani and three months into the nuclear deal with six world powers, many in the middle class in Iran feel the government - which has called itself the government of prudence and hope - has not delivered on its promise of economic improvement. According to the government’s statistics centre, only 23 million out of 64 million Iranians of working age have jobs. In March, the minister of labour, Ali Rabiei, said that out of these 23 million, seven million have “unofficial or pseudo jobs”. And according to the World Bank, Iran in 2014 had the world’s highest inflation rate after Venezuela, Sudan, Argentina, Malawi and Belarus. “With prudence and hope… all the problems will be solved,” Rouhani said in a television election debate in May 2013. “The nuclear issue and sanctions will be solved and we will have a booming economy.” In June 2013, later in the election campaign, Rouhani said : “In the first two months of the prudence and hope government people will feel the positive effects of our efforts. I have one-month, three-month, one-year and four-year plans to eliminate economic problems.” And among his promises, Rouhani promised to decrease unemployment “dramatically”, vowing his government would bring it down to “normal global rates”. With all these promises, Elham and some other Iranians were expecting that soon after the nuclear deal, they could feel positive effects on the economy and consequently on their personal lives. But positive change has not occurred. For nearly ten years Elham, who holds a bachelor’s degree in accounting, used to work full-time in a small private food distribution company, while also holding a part-time position in an insurance company. But a few months ago, she was laid off from her full-time job. “Two or three weeks after the nuclear deal my boss told me that they didn’t have enough budget and had to let me go,” she said. “So I had to concentrate on my part-time job, but that’s not enough. I have also applied for so many jobs and haven’t heard back.” According to the official Statistical Centre of Iran the unemployment rate was 10.4% in 2013 and 10.6% in 2014. In March 2015 Iranian economic analyst Majid Salimi Boroujeni estimated that in 2015 the unemployment rate would be “10 to 12%”. On 25 October, ISNA news agency reported that in the last Iranian month (ending 22 October) the month-on-month inflation rate had decreased by 0.3% to 13.3%, and the year-on-year rate had decreased by 0.7% to 10.9%. The economic situation has alarmed officials. On 3 October, four ministers - industry, economy, welfare and defence – made public a letter to Rouhani about an economic downturn they said “could turn into a crisis”. The letter added that although the nuclear deal had led to “plenty of” economic benefits, it had also “created some ambiguities in the market” that needed “to be quickly addressed”. Rouhani thinks otherwise, and has insisted there is no downturn. On 10 October, a week after his four ministers made their letter public, he said “the situation is such that we might once again fall into a downturn. We need to be alert and try hard.” But Elham agrees with four ministers that the country is already experiencing a downturn: “This nuclear agreement had no positive effect on our lives. Our pockets are empty. Prices have not gone down but up. All people are postponing purchases, waiting for the situation to stabilise, therefore all the markets - car, real estate, stock - are on hold. We are already in a crisis. I haven’t seen my kids since 6am when I left home, and I have to drive around until 10pm.” “I don’t want to say Rouhani has fooled us, but honestly over the past two years, nothing has changed,” said an owner of a small bakery in Tehran. “Since the nuclear deal my customers have shrank and as a result my income has dropped.” But he is hopeful. “I think that once our frozen assets are released and injected into the market, the situation will improve. Now foreign countries are also investing in Iran and in a year our market will flourish.” In late September Bloomberg quoted Iranian central bank vice governor for foreign exchange affairs, Gholamali Kamyab, that Iran expects about $29bn of its more than $100bn frozen funds to be unfrozen and repatriated to the central bank by January 2016. Being stuck in an economic blockade for few years, Iran needs time to get back on its feet. But Mohsen Renani, an economist at Isfahan University, recently told Etemad newspaper there would be no economic improvement in the near future, given the Iranian economy has structural problems. “We had some immediate [economic] problems that were caused by the sanctions - now we are getting rid of them,” he said. “But we also have some deep and chronic structural problems [in our economy] that can lead us into another crisis. In fact, the government can’t deal with this crisis on its own… If we want to pass this crisis, the whole political system needs to get engaged.” Here’s what one of the journalists at the business newspaper Donya-e-Eqtesad, who favours a liberalised economy, has to say about public expectations of economic improvement: “Iran is like a thirsty person struck by drought who now thinks that he has reached a spring. He wants to quench his thirst. You can’t ask him to stay thirsty for another year. Not that he can’t. If there is no other choice than waiting, he will, by he won’t be happy with it. “Over the past four years, people had endured a lot of hardship. Mentally, they are ready to collapse - giving them an overview of the future and telling them things will get better won’t make them content. However, they have no other choice but to accept reality.”"
"Warren’s foreign policy shows she’s missing why Trump was elected","In laying blame at Trump’s door, the senator isn’t seeing why things have not changed and gotten worse under him  Mon 11 Feb 2019 15.53 GMT   Last modified on Wed 20 Feb 2019 20.36 GMT   T he next presidential election is more than a year away and no fewer than 11 aspirants have announced that they are running, with another eight labeled “certain” or “likely” to run. All are now out there trying to tell their stories and separate themselves from the pack, but it is Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren who is first out of the gates with a formal foreign policy. Warren’s meaty article in Foreign Affairs is worth paying attention to, not so much because she is saying anything that others won’t. I imagine in fact that she is saying what all the Democrats will: end perpetual war, get out of Afghanistan and Iraq, “a foreign policy that works for all Americans”. And I understand as well that the purpose of these articles is to cover a lot of ground and not be too far off the beaten path, perhaps to say something to appease the experts and the news media, but not to write some treatise that is set in stone. Still I have very bad news for Warren: she will get none of it. And what is more, in laying blame at Donald Trump’s door, certainly red meat for her party loyalists, Warren doggedly misses why Trump was elected, and why under him, things have not changed and gotten worse. The United States, Warren says, has embarked on “a series of seemingly endless wars, engaging in conflicts with mistaken or uncertain objectives and no obvious path to completion”. It’s fine rhetoric but the obvious path to completion is merely to end the wars. And yet the Bush White House couldn’t or didn’t want to. And Obama vacillated and expanded to the point where bombing and killing was being pursued in almost a dozen countries when he left office. And as for Trump? He’s done little and he’s been publicly admonished by his own secretary of defense when he decided he wanted to end just one of those conflicts. But “the United States”? Really? Other than Afghanistan after 9/11 – and that’s all – “the United States” didn’t embark on these wars. The national security community did. The government. Overtly, covertly, with high hopes or unwarranted self-confidence, they got their way. Who is the real culprit then? It isn’t Warren’s “elites”, the corporation, or Trump. It is Washington and its ability, indeed even its self-appointed duty, to stand in the way of anything that it sees as not in its interest. She may not think it, but Warren is merely genuflecting before this deep state, declaring her allegiance to a “muscular military” and calling for “strong yet pragmatic security policies”. She of course offers a laundry list of things that must be preserved or strengthened that’s non-military – from technological superiority to diplomacy to strong alliances. And she decries the military and civilian policymakers who “seem [in]capable of defining success”. But in her innocence as to why we are stuck in seemingly endless wars she also seems oblivious to the fact that she is already capitulating to the very forces that ensure that we can’t change anything. Warren’s tour of the world – a Russia that is “belligerent and resurgent”, a China that has “weaponized” everything, nuclear proliferation in North Korea, “looming unrest in the western hemisphere” – seems intent on proving herself neither a dove nor naive. Along the way she wants to “face down antidemocratic forces around the world”, end terrorism and deal with the “challenges” of cyber-attacks. Dealing with it all, she says, requires “more than a strong military”. And so she wants multilateral arms control, more investments in diplomacy, increased foreign aid to advance US interests, strong and large alliances where our partners pay their fair share. Oh and she’s for peace, which she describes as “preventing problems from morphing into costly wars” and “not policing the world”, which somehow she twists to make an innovation after two years of Trump. Trump campaigned against policing the world, for America first, against this permanent government, this swamp, and in his two years in office they have squarely subordinated him to be in “command” of nothing. It is of course Trump’s fault in his shallowness. But Barack Obama also experienced this crowd, and the full force of being unable to change hardly anything. The American people, Warren says, “have less faith in their government today than at any other time in modern US history”. There’s no danger in saying it; it’s provable by polls. She doesn’t elaborate or name the culprits behind the many national security misfortunes she identifies. And in that is presidential weakness of the worst kind.

"John Bolton threatens war crimes court with sanctions in virulent attack","US national security adviser calls ICC illegitimate and says ‘we will let it die on its own’  Owen Bowcott ,  Oliver Holmes , and  Erin Durkin  Mon 10 Sep 2018 19.49 BST   First published on Mon 10 Sep 2018 09.51 BST   John Bolton , the hawkish US national security adviser, has threatened the international criminal court (ICC) with sanctions and made an excoriating attack on the institution in a speech in Washington. Bolton pushed for sanctions over an ICC investigation into alleged American war crimes in Afghanistan . He also announced on Monday the closure of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) office in Washington because of its calls for an ICC inquiry into Israel. “The United States will use any means necessary to protect our citizens and those of our allies from unjust prosecution by this illegitimate court,” Bolton said. He said the Trump administration would “fight back” and impose sanctions – even seeking to criminally prosecute ICC officials – if the court formally proceeded with opening an investigation into alleged war crimes committed by US military and intelligence staff during the war in Afghanistan or pursued any investigation into Israel or other US allies. John Bolton, the US official launching a blistering attack on the international criminal court, is a longtime foreign policy hawk tapped by President Trump this year as his national security adviser. Bolton, 69, was named to the top post in March – becoming Trump’s third national security adviser in just 14 months in office. Over a three-decade career in foreign policy, he has advocated frequent use of military force and disdained diplomacy and international institutions. Before joining the Trump administration, he was best known for a brief stint as president George W Bush’s ambassador to the United Nations – a body he openly sneered at, once saying that that if the 38-floor UN building in New York “lost 10 stories, it wouldn’t make a bit of difference". Bolton has called for bombing both North Korea and Iran. Less than a month before his appointment by Trump, he penned a Wall Street Journal op-ed making “the legal case for striking North Korea first". He was a harsh critic of the Iran nuclear deal, which Trump has now pulled out of, and went further, advocating military force against the country. A bombing campaign was the only way to stop Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, he wrote in another op-ed . He left a post at the rightwing American Enterprise Institute and as a commentator on Fox News. Bolton’s brief stint as Bush’s UN ambassador came to an end because the Senate would not confirm him. It’s not his first time tangling with the ICC - during the Bush administration, he led the successful effort to prevent the US from joining the court. As undersecretary of state, he travelled around the world negotiating two-way agreements in which countries pledged not to send US officials to the court. He also forcefully opposed the UN security council referring suspected genocide in the Darfur region of Sudan to the court, though the United States ultimately sat out that vote and the referral went forward. Bolton also held senior positions in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and the elder George Bush, and wrote a book summing up his views: Surrender Is Not An Option. He is derided by critics as a warmonger, but defines his own philosophy as “Americanist” – a close cousin to Trump’s “America First” slogan – and is no fan of traditional carrot and stick diplomacy. “I don’t do carrots,” he has said. Bolton vowed that the United States would retaliate by banning ICC judges and prosecutors from entering the US, imposing sanctions on any funds they had in the States and prosecuting them in the American court system. “If the court comes after us, Israel, or other US allies we will not sit quietly,” he said, also threatening to impose the same sanctions on any country that aided the investigation. He condemned the inquiry into war crimes in Afghanistan as an “utterly unfounded, unjustifiable investigation” and the court as illegitimate. “We will let the ICC die on its own. After all, for all intents and purposes, the ICC is already dead,” Bolton said. He said the US would negotiate more binding, bilateral agreements to prohibit countries from surrendering Americans to the court in The Hague. David Scheffer, who established the ICC on behalf of the US and served as the country’s ambassador-at-large for war crimes issues , said: “The Bolton speech today isolates the United States from international criminal justice and severely undermines our leadership in bringing perpetrators of atrocity crimes to justice elsewhere in the world. “The double standard set forth in his speech will likely play well with authoritarian regimes, which will resist accountability for atrocity crimes and ignore international efforts to advance the rule of law. This was a speech soaked in fear and Bolton sounded the message, once again, that the United States is intimidated by international law and multilateral organizations. I saw not strength but weakness conveyed today by the Trump Administration.” The senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat confirmed that a US official had notified the Palestinian leadership that its diplomatic mission in Washington DC would be closed. The move follows a year of US action seen as detrimental to Palestinians, most recently the slashing of hundreds of millions of dollars in humanitarian assistance. Trump has said the cuts were to pressure the Palestinians to make a peace deal, although his administration has not announced any specific efforts. Erekat said: “This is yet another affirmation of the Trump administration’s policy to collectively punish the Palestinian people.” He added that Palestinian authorities were taking “necessary measures to protect the rights of our citizens living in the United States to access their consular services”. “We reiterate that the rights of the Palestinian people are not for sale, that we will not succumb to US threats and bullying and that we will continue our legitimate struggle for freedom, justice, and independence, including by all political and legal means possible,” he said. The UN-backed ICC’s remit is to bring to justice the perpetrators of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. The US did not ratify the Rome treaty that established the court in 2002. The then president George W Bush was strongly opposed to the court. President Barack Obama subsequently took measures to improve cooperation with it. “We will consider taking steps in the UN security council to constrain the court’s sweeping powers, including to ensure that the ICC does not exercise jurisdiction over Americans and the nationals of our allies that have not ratified the Rome statute,” Bolton said. In May, Trump opened a US embassy to Israel in Jerusalem , ending decades of consensus that the contested city’s status should be decided in future negotiations, as Palestinians claim its eastern parts while Israel claims the entire city as its capital. The embassy opening prompted the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, to reject Washington’s traditional role as a mediator, recalling his envoy to the US and stopping communication. Days later, the Palestinian foreign minister asked the ICC chief prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, to open an investigation into alleged Israeli war crimes, crimes against humanity, and apartheid. The referral came during a period of heightened bloodshed in Gaza as Israeli snipers shot hundreds of people attending weekly protests. Israel is not a signatory to the ICC and has said the body lacks jurisdiction. The ICC launched a preliminary examination in 2015 into allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity in Israel and the Palestinian territories. However, the court has not opened a full investigation that could ultimately lead to indictments. “We will not allow the ICC or any other organisation to constrain Israel’s right to self-defence,” Bolton said on Monday. A spokesman for the ICC said earlier on Monday: “The international criminal court is aware of media reports of the speech scheduled to be delivered by US national security adviser, Mr John Bolton, later today concerning the ICC. “The Rome statute, the court’s founding treaty, today benefits from the membership of 123 states parties representing all regions of the world. The ICC, as a judicial institution, acts strictly within the legal framework of the Rome statute and is committed to the independent and impartial exercise of its mandate.”"
"Iran Agrees to Send Enriched Uranium to Russia","Advertisement By STEVEN ERLANGER and MARK LANDLER OCT. 1, 2009  GENEVA — Iran agreed on Thursday in talks with the United States and other major powers to open its newly revealed uranium enrichment plant near Qum to international inspection in the next two weeks and to send most of its openly declared enriched uranium outside Iran to be turned into fuel for a small reactor that produces medical isotopes, senior American and other Western officials said. Iran’s agreement in principle to export most of its enriched uranium for processing — if it happens — would represent a major accomplishment for the West, reducing Iran’s ability to make a nuclear weapon quickly and buying more time for negotiations to bear fruit. If Iran has secret stockpiles of enriched uranium, however, the accomplishment would be hollow, a senior American official conceded. The officials described the long day of talks here with Iran, the first such discussions in which the United States has participated fully, as a modest success on a long and complicated road. Iran had at least finally engaged with the big powers on its nuclear program after more than a year and had agreed to some tangible, confidence-building steps before another meeting with the same participants before the end of this month. Advertisement But despite the relatively promising outcome, the Obama administration was at pains to strike a cautious tone, given Iran’s history of duplicity, its crackdown on its own people after the tainted June presidential elections and President Obama ’s concern about being perceived as naïve or susceptible to a policy of Iranian delays. Advertisement Mr. Obama, speaking in Washington, called the talks “constructive,” but warned Tehran that he was prepared to move quickly to more stringent sanctions if negotiations over Iran’s nuclear ambitions dragged on. “We’re not interested in talking for the sake of talking,” Mr. Obama told reporters in the White House Diplomatic Reception Room. “If Iran does not take steps in the near future to live up to its obligations, then the United States will not continue to negotiate indefinitely.” France and Britain have spoken of December as an informal deadline for Iran to negotiate seriously about stopping enrichment and cooperate fully with the International Atomic Energy Agency . American officials say that timeline is “about right,” but Iran continues to insist that it has the right to enrich uranium for what it calls a purely civilian program. Mr. Obama said Tehran must allow international inspectors into the site near Qum within the next two weeks, a timeline Iran’s chief nuclear negotiator, Saeed Jalili, agreed to here. The atomic energy agency’s director general, Mohamed ElBaradei , will travel to Tehran this weekend to discuss the details and timing of the inspections, officials said. But the Americans also want Iran to cooperate with the inspectors and make personnel and documents about the site near Qum available. Besides the scheduling of another meeting, the main practical accomplishment on Thursday was Iran’s agreement in principle — to be worked out by experts later this month in Vienna — to ship what American officials called “most” of its declared stockpile of lightly enriched uranium to Russia and France to be turned into nuclear fuel. While American officials refused to specify the amount, other Western officials said it could be 1,200 kilograms, or more than 2,600 pounds, of enriched uranium, which could be as much as 75 percent of Iran’s declared stockpile. While there may be hidden stocks of enriched uranium, such a transfer, if it occurs, “buys some time” for further negotiations, a senior American official said. Advertisement Given the assessment that Iran has made enough low-enriched uranium to produce at least one nuclear weapon at some time in the future, a sharp reduction in its stockpile would be “a confidence-building measure to alleviate tensions and buy us some diplomatic space,” the official said. Israel, the nation most concerned about a nuclear-armed Iran, has been informed of the discussions, another American official said. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter. You must select a newsletter to subscribe to. Iran’s uranium is enriched to about 3.5 to 5 percent, the officials said; the Tehran reactor for making medical isotopes, last powered by Argentine-made fuel in 1993, needs uranium enriched to 19.75 percent, still far below weapons grade. And that uranium must then be fabricated into metal rods for the reactor. Iran had told the International Atomic Energy Agency that it needed fuel for the Tehran reactor before December 2010. Washington, with its allies, pushed the agency to offer Iran the fuel, but made from Iran’s own enriched uranium as a feedstock. Mr. Jalili agreed to that in principle on Thursday. The talks were between Iran and the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council — the United States, Russia, China , Britain and France — as well as Germany , and led by the European Union ’s foreign policy chief, Javier Solana . The tone of the discussions, held just outside Geneva , was considerably more positive than just a week ago, after the United States revealed the existence of the uranium enrichment site near Qum and, with its European allies, threatened Iran with tough new sanctions if it refused to halt its uranium enrichment program, which they suspect is meant for creating atomic weapons. “This was a day very much for the engagement track of the two-track strategy,” a senior American official said, with the second track — increased sanctions — to be discussed only if this new round of negotiations founders. After a plenary session in the morning, the participants adjourned to a lunch where informal discussions continued, followed by three hours of informal bilateral meetings. Those included a 45-minute session between the chief American diplomat here, Under Secretary of State William J. Burns, and Mr. Jalili, the highest level United States-Iranian talks in three decades. Mr. Burns raised a range of topics, including the nuclear dispute and the plant near Qum and human-rights issues, American officials said, while the Iranians raised their own concerns, including the need for a world free of nuclear bombs and access to peaceful nuclear energy for all. Advertisement Mr. Jalili, in a news conference, called the discussions “good talks that will be a framework for better talks,” and expressed satisfaction that the world had engaged with Iran’s global agenda, which includes nuclear disarmament. He denied that there were any other Iranian nuclear facilities hidden from the I.A.E.A. Many diplomats and analysts believe that the plant near Qum is only one of a series of hidden installations that Iran has constructed, in addition to its publicly acknowledged ones, for what is considered to be a military program. Iran insists that its program is purely peaceful and that it has a right under the nonproliferation treaty to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes. But it has regularly lied to the United Nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency about its facilities. Despite the uncertainties, nuclear experts hailed the tentative agreements.  “It’s significant,” David Albright, president of the Institute for Science and International Security , a private group in Washington that tracks nuclear proliferation, said. “The principle is important.” Mr. Albright said the amount of low-enriched uranium to be shipped out of Iran was also significant. Iran’s stockpile has worried some arms controllers, who fear that Tehran may drop out of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and further enrich the material into fuel for a bomb. The new accord would end that prospect — at least for the exported uranium. Mr. Albright cautioned that the deal would become a real solution only if Iran expanded the accord to cover all the uranium that it wanted enriched. “Iran’s made a concession,” he said. “But it has little meaning for the long term unless Iran continues to send out” its uranium for enrichment.

"Unfriended: Dark Web review – cyber sequel traffics in digital cruelty","A low-budget follow-up to the 2014 horror, taking place entirely on a laptop screen, isn’t always convincing but boasts some inventive suspense  Thu 19 Jul 2018 09.00 BST   Last modified on Mon 6 Aug 2018 11.50 BST   I f you were to guess which 2018 film contained references to student gun reform, Cambridge Analytica, Flint’s ongoing water problem and the Iranian nuclear deal, I’m going to take a big leap here and assume that you wouldn’t have predicted a sequel to 2014’s laptop-based cyber-horror Unfriended . While there’s still the standard checklist of shouting, clicking, screaming, buffering and dying, it’s also a film that’s surprisingly plugged into the world around us and it’s uploading into cinemas just weeks after The First Purge , another horror sequel that felt strangely of the time with visual nods to an increase in far-right violence, including a queasy Charlottesville “homage”. Both come from Blumhouse, the staggeringly successful production company that struck gold with last year’s razor sharp thriller Get Out but has gained an industry foothold through aggressive franchising. The first, and doubtfully last, sequel to sleeper hit Unfriended, which turned a $1m budget into a $64m gross, isn’t worthy of any real comparison to Jordan Peele’s socially minded game-changer but together with the recent Purge prequel, it suggests a certain brand awareness of audience. It strives for authenticity and acceptance from its young target demographic and while its hi-tech trappings might age fast (many of its real-world nods appear in the trending news box on the Facebook homepage which has since been scrapped ), an abundance of effort is rarely a bad thing in the horror genre. In Unfriended: Dark Web, we start on the home screen of software developer Matias’s new laptop, one that he found at a local cafe and took as his own. It’s game night with his friends and due to laziness, travel constraints and one of them living in another continent, it’s taking place via Skype. But it’s hard to concentrate on Cards Against Humanity when a previously logged in stranger’s Facebook page is blowing up with odd messages. Coupled with the discovery of a hidden folder of unsettling, voyeuristic video files, Matias starts to question just what the previous owner was up to … The practice of watching a story play out via a laptop screen on a bigger screen is still relatively, mercifully unusual and there’s a make-or-break period of acclimatization that takes place during the first 10 minutes. It’s most definitely not a film to double (triple?) screen, one’s focus in constant demand by information popping up all over the place, and it’s an experience that will prove intensely frustrating for many but for me, far less so than its predecessor. Part of this is down to the shift in narrative from a tale of cyberbullying to a shadowy conspiracy. The characters who tapped and scrolled their way through Unfriended were so intensely vile that watching them fall prey to a vengeful cyber-ghost was a relief, the unending splurge of obnoxious revelations removing any investment we might have in their fate. There’s a concerted attempt in the follow-up to create a more involving scenario with characters we might not want to see die quite so horrifically. The laptop-lifting protagonist is trying to perfect a piece of software that will make communication with his deaf girlfriend that much easier and, for the genre, their storyline is handled with surprising sensitivity. They’re friends with a lesbian couple, played by Rebecca Rittenhouse and Get Out’s Betty Gabriel, who face parental issues on the news of their engagement, and the very existence of gay characters in a genre movie is something of a rarity. It’s hardly a script with a great deal of depth but as first-time director Stephen Susco ups the ante, and the violence, we’re just that little bit more invested. It also helps that the nefarious web they get caught up in unfolds like a tantalizing mystery thriller, each detail grimier than the last, building up to an effectively nasty underworld of online evil. The online framework is used for some inventive suspense (an unstable wifi connection, death scenes teased by YouTube montages) but while the performances remain convincing, the film often struggles to convince us on some of their decision-making with some of the clicking, downloading and digging feeling as dumb as a creepy basement investigation in a more traditionally presented horror film. It’s frustrating when stupidity sets in and some of the visual trickery that worked in the earlier stages starts to grate, with unintentional laughter emerging from some of the silliest on-screen IMs. Even if some of the late-stage plotting seems sloppy and increasingly preposterous, there’s a callousness to the brutal last act that, together with the far patchier, yet similarly hard-edged First Purge, feels like a definite product of the time we’re in, as war on terror-era torture porn did in the mid-2000s. The iciness of the villains extends beyond digital spaces and into the real world, an inability to see people as anything more than avatars to troll, abuse and violate. While its scares might not linger, its bleak worldview will."

"Obama, Keen to Push Israeli-Palestinian Peace, Will Meet With Netanyahu","Advertisement Supported by By  Mark Landler and Peter Baker President Obama arrived in New York City on Sunday evening for three days that will mix election-year politics with a farewell to the world stage at the United Nations. But the visit comes against a suddenly tense backdrop, after a powerful explosion rocked a Manhattan street and a man claiming fealty to the Islamic State stabbed several people in a Minnesota shopping mall. The president’s diplomatic schedule also got more complicated. The White House announced Sunday that he would hold meetings at the United Nations with leaders from Israel and China. Both will be closely watched for signs of friction in relationships that have been marked by tension during Mr. Obama’s tenure. On Wednesday, he is scheduled to confer with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel at a time when he is weighing whether to propose his own framework for a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians over Mr. Netanyahu’s objections. The two leaders have clashed repeatedly over the Iran nuclear agreement and Mr. Obama’s pursuit of Middle East peace. The meeting could be their last face-to-face encounter before Mr. Obama’s term ends in January. Last week, the United States and Israel sealed a $38 billion, 10-year American security aid package to Israel, the largest ever granted to an ally. Officials in both countries have characterized the deal as proof that the American-Israeli relationship is enduring, whatever the strains between the two men. On Monday, Mr. Obama is scheduled to have a brief session with China’s premier, Li Keqiang, a week after North Korea tested another nuclear device. The president is expected to press Mr. Li to use China’s influence to discipline the North, something the Chinese have resisted for fear of destabilizing an impoverished neighbor. Mr. Obama returned recently from a trip to Hangzhou, China, which was marred by a messy arrival at the airport that led to shouting matches between American and Chinese officials. Administration officials played down the significance of the episode, saying Mr. Obama’s talks with President Xi Jinping were not affected. This will be Mr. Obama’s last appearance at the United Nations, and his aides said he would use it to recall his diplomatic achievements and argue that his multilateral approach is a model for dealing with future crises. But the still-unexplained bombing in New York and the stabbings in Minnesota, which the F.B.I. is treating as a “ potential act of terrorism ,” guarantee that security will be at the forefront. So will presidential politics. Mr. Obama arrived in New York a day earlier than usual so he could attend a fund-raiser in Manhattan for his preferred candidate, Hillary Clinton. Mr. Obama’s motorcade crossed Manhattan on 23rd Street, the site of Saturday’s explosion, though several blocks to the east, before arriving at Gramercy Park. Mr. Obama spoke to 65 people at the apartment of the restaurateur Danny Meyer. The guests paid $25,000 each to attend, while the chairmen raised or contributed $250,000 to the Hillary Victory Fund, a joint organization of the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee that raises money for Democrats up and down the ballot. Mr. Obama said that despite the gulf in qualifications between Mrs. Clinton and the Republican nominee, Donald J. Trump, the election was likely to be close because of what he called the “structural” polarization of American society. And he spoke more starkly than he had before about the role gender is playing in the race. “There’s a reason why we haven’t had a woman president,” Mr. Obama said. “We as a society still grapple with what it means to see powerful women. And it still troubles us in a lot of ways, unfairly.” Mrs. Clinton has her own schedule of meetings at the United Nations, including with the presidents of Egypt and Ukraine and the prime minister of Japan. It was not clear whether she planned to meet with Mr. Netanyahu, a leader with whom she had her own clashes while secretary of state. On Sunday, Mr. Obama made clear that now that he had demonstrated a commitment to Israel’s security, he planned to press Mr. Netanyahu to move toward reconciliation with the Palestinians. “The meeting also will be an opportunity to discuss the need for genuine advancement of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the face of deeply troubling trends on the ground,” Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said in a statement. Left unclear was whether Mr. Obama would go beyond simply urging Mr. Netanyahu. The president is considering whether to publicly lay out his own parameters for a settlement of the long-running conflict, a prospect Mr. Netanyahu has strongly opposed. The president’s speech to the General Assembly would be a logical place for such a move, though his advisers say he might wait until after the November election to avoid its becoming part of campaign politics. If he proceeds, he could give a speech outlining his ideas or even encapsulate them in a resolution before the United Nations Security Council. Aides to Mr. Obama say he has played his cards very close to his chest, not discussing his plans outside a tiny circle. Mark Landler reported from New York, and Peter Baker from Jerusalem.

"What the Oslo Accords Accomplished","Advertisement Supported by By  Jodi Rudoren When President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority told the United Nations on Wednesday that the Palestinian people “cannot continue to be bound by” agreements with Israel, what was he repudiating? Mainly, he was talking about the Oslo peace accords, which Mr. Abbas’s predecessor, Yasir Arafat, signed in 1993 and 1995 with Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli leader who was later assassinated by an extremist Jew. Those accords created the Palestinian Authority as a provisional government, and laid out a five-year timetable for resolving all areas of conflict between the Palestinians and the Israelis. The accords divided the West Bank into three sections: Area A, the major cities where Palestinians were to have full control; Area B, where Israel would be in charge of security while Palestinians handled civilian matters; and Area C, under full Israeli control. Those delineations remain in place today. Area C covers more than two-thirds of the West Bank — that is where the Israeli settlements are — and Palestinians complain of Israeli incursions into Area A. The Oslo accords are the cornerstone of what is known as the peace process. They included the first formal mutual recognition between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization, and specified that bilateral negotiations were the only viable path to Palestinian statehood. The process has been essentially in stalemate for years. The most recent talks, brokered by Secretary of State John Kerry, lasted nine months and collapsed in April 2014. Also included under the general umbrella of “Oslo” is the Paris Protocol, signed in 1994, which established a framework for economic relations. It created a customs union, under which Israel collects taxes and customs duties on the Palestinians’ behalf, and laid out detailed arrangements for imports and exports from the West Bank and Gaza. As important as the Oslo accords have been, it was not clear whether Mr. Abbas’s declaration on Wednesday would have any tangible effect. For one thing, he predicated his statements on assertions that Israel is violating the agreements, which Israel denies. Each side has frequently accused the other of violations over the years. Notably, Mr. Abbas did not announce that he would undo any of what the accords have established. He did not say he would dissolve the Palestinian Authority, for example, or take any specific steps to curtail the authority’s security, economic or civil coordination with Israel. Advertisement"
"The US has ruined Afghanistan. It can’t just walk away now","The departure of American troops risks civil war, and many Afghans fear the return of a fundamentalist society  Fri 8 Feb 2019 06.00 GMT   Last modified on Fri 8 Feb 2019 22.02 GMT   T he approaching US withdrawal from Afghanistan is not an honourable retreat – it’s a capitulation. The best the Americans can hope for in exit talks with the Taliban, due to resume in Doha later this month, is a promise that coalition troops, unlike the British army led by General Elphinstone in 1842, will not depart under fire. After more than 17 years of conflict, with at least 38,000 civilians killed and millions more injured, traumatised or exiled, none of the long-term objectives set out by George W Bush following the 2001 invasion has been met. In short, the US has lost the war, and lost badly. The al-Qaida terrorists who used Afghanistan as a base from which to launch the 9/11 attacks have not been wholly vanquished, as Bush promised. Their former leader, Osama bin Laden, is dead but the group, and likewise Islamic State, made territorial gains in Afghanistan last year, according to UN experts . It is unlikely that Taliban leaders could in future prevent jihadists once again using parts of the country as a terrorist safe haven – a key demand of American negotiators – even if they sincerely wanted to. The idea, promoted by successive US administrations and Nato partners such as Britain, that Afghanistan could become a model nation-building exercise has long since been exposed as a neoliberal fantasy. This is not to dismiss the tenacious efforts of British and allied forces on the ground who struggled valiantly, for instance, to bring stability to Helmand province. But they, and the Afghan people, have paid a terrible price for a lack of clarity and candour on the part of the politicians who sent them there. Another delusion – that Afghan security forces could be trained and equipped to a point where they could, unaided, contain the Taliban and control the country – has also been shattered . Despite Nato’s best efforts, 30 to 40 Afghan soldiers and police were being killed each day last autumn. About 45,000 Afghan soldiers have died since 2014. This increase in mortality mirrors the decrease in western troop numbers since the 2011 peak . Despite massive diplomatic and developmental assistance, the Afghan government holds limited sway beyond the barricaded safe zones of central Kabul. The Taliban refuse to allow it to participate in withdrawal talks, dismissing it as a mere puppet. The implications, once the Americans have gone, are ominous. A rapid descent into civil war, involving government forces, jihadist groups and rival warlords, in a rerun of not-forgotten 1990s anarchy, is a strong possibility. Last year saw record civilian deaths , caused by terror bombings, intensified fighting and increased US airstrikes. Coming years may prove yet more deadly. Even if the worst is avoided, Afghan civil society organisations and education, public health and women’s rights advocates rightly dread the inclusion of Taliban Sunni fundamentalists in any postwar political settlement. Despite assurances to the contrary, the prospective return of Taliban hardliners to positions of influence presages a new dark age of regression, discrimination and bigotry. And how long will any pretence of democratic government persist? As in the past, Afghanistan could quickly revert to a Great Game free-for-all involving Pakistan, India, Russia, Iran – and now China, too. In sum, the Americans are leaving an unholy mess that they, more than any other individual actor, helped create. From a narrow US viewpoint, there are still plenty of reasons for quitting while they’re behind. Donald Trump campaigned against “endless wars”, and recently decided to halve the current US force of 14,000. Most voters want the troops out . Billions of dollars have been expended to no lasting effect, while millions more have been lost to corruption. In the absence of any post-9/11 foreign terrorist attacks on US soil, Bush’s old claim that fighting terror abroad avoids the need to fight it at home carries diminishing weight. In a significant shift, the New York Times which, like all major US media, supported the 2001 invasion, called this week for the troops to come home – and eviscerated the overall US approach to fighting terror. Far from eradicating international terrorism as Bush pledged, the “global war on terror” was in large part responsible for the worldwide growth since 2001 of Islamist-inspired terrorist groups, the paper’s editorial noted. Put this another way. The British-supported US global war on terror, which has claimed about half a million lives, been waged across 80 nations, corroded respect for human rights and international law, and cost an estimated $5.9tn, was, from the outset, a catastrophic mistake based on a false premise, aggravated by self-righteous arrogance and an unforgivable ignorance of the world beyond America’s shores. At long last, reality dawns! Yet wait. Is this a lesson the US leviathan in all its many guises can now safely be assumed to have learned? Not really. Trump’s announcement this week that he plans to redeploy troops and air power from Syria to neighbouring Iraq, in order to “keep watch” on Iran, is the latest clue to Washington’s next Middle East war of choice. US intelligence chiefs told Trump last week that Iran was not a pressing concern , noting that it continued (unlike the US) to honour the 2015 nuclear pact. But Trump and his gang of ideologues and know-nothings, egged on by Israel and the Saudis, persist in mendaciously characterising the Tehran regime as the “world’s leading state sponsor of terror”, and a direct threat to US national security. That is what they said about Saddam Hussein. In Washington speak, it’s a casus belli. Perhaps there is something in the nature and psyche of the ever-embattled American republic that means it needs monstrous foreign enemies – hateful bogeymen such as Saddam, Manuel Noriega, Muammar Gaddafi, Nicolás Maduro or Ayatollah Ali Khamenei – in order to sustain its own founding myths. King George, the original “tyrant”, was vanquished by force of arms, and they have never forgotten it. It’s a mindset that has to change. Instead of threatening to begin a new war with Iran, US leaders should be trying much harder to end the old one in Afghanistan in a responsible, sustainable, humane manner. Don’t just scuttle away. The US should work with all elements of Afghan society, including Taliban moderates – in a civilian, not military, capacity – to reconstruct the country the war destroyed. After 17 or so years of ultimately pointless,criminal mayhem, an apology plus reparations to the Afghan people would be a good start. • Simon Tisdall is a foreign affairs commentator"
"Iran still locked out of global financial system, says central bank chief","EU and US failing to fully comply with commitments made under landmark nuclear deal, says Valiollah Seif  Fri 20 May 2016 18.12 BST   Last modified on Thu 25 May 2017 08.48 BST   The governor of Iran’s central bank has said obstacles stopping Iranian banks from rejoining the global financial system show that the US and the EU are failing to fully comply with their commitments under the landmark nuclear deal. Four months after the lifting of sanctions against Iran, big European banks remain reluctant to handle Iranian payments despite recent efforts by the US secretary of state, John Kerry, to reassure them that dealing with Tehran is now permissible. Valiollah Seif told the Guardian that western governments need to translate their words into action, playing a more active role in making sure that banks are confident they will not be punished for reestablishing ties with his country. “Some movement and western officials have made some positive pronouncements, but banks need tangible reassurances that they would be immune from baseless allegations [of sanctions breaches],” he said on Thursday on the sidelines of the Euromoney Iran Conference in London . The US, the UK, France and Germany said jointly on Thursday that they “will not stand in the way of permitted business activity with Iran, and we will not stand in the way of international firms or financial institutions engaging with Iran as long as they follow all applicable laws”. Officials from the US office of foreign assets control (OFAC) are travelling to Europe soon to give further clarifications to the banks. But such pleas have so far failed as banks complain about the threat posed by continuing US sanctions relating to terrorism. Uncertainty over the US presidential elections and the over-zealous application of US sanctions – even in countries where they do not apply – have also exacerbated those fears. “Banks need enough reassurances, even if this means rewriting guidelines or revising regulations, or giving banks written guarantees,” Seif said. “Until our western interlocutors have fully fulfilled their obligations under the nuclear deal, we won’t see a real change in our banking relations.” UK firms such as Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) have refused to serve as clearing banks for their Iranian counterparts, preventing them from reopening their London branches, the governor said. “Our first expectation from Britain is to provide assistance so that our Iranian banks can start operating in London again,” he said. The British government holds big stakes in both RBS and Lloyds. RBS declined to comment on the issue but a spokesman from Lloyds said: “We are not aware of any such issues arising. We do not restrict payments where they are allowed by the legal and regulatory frameworks under which we operate.” There are two other areas where Britain can help Iran to normalise its banking relations. Iran is seeking to remove itself from the blacklist of non-cooperative countries in the FATF, the Financial Action Task Force (on Money Laundering). The FATF is the intergovernmental organisation combating money laundering and terrorism financing. “Iran was listed because of political reasons and now there needs to be a political decision to delist Iran,” Seif said. Seif said Iran was unable to repay its debts to some of its foreign suppliers during the sanctions years because it did not have access to any payments channel, even though it had enough money. Moreover, restriction on Iran’s access to the dollar system has created serious issues, Seif said, even in cases where no dollars are exchanged. “If we want to change Omani rials to euros, we don’t need dollars, but the system is designed in away that it has to be changed to dollars first, then euros. They should find a way for us to resolve this issue.” Seif said Iran’s economic situation has improved dramatically since the coming to power of the moderate president Hassan Rouhani in 2013. “You can’t compare today’s situation to three years ago,” he said. “Three years ago Iran was experiencing a volatile economic situation, rising inflation, unstable market and fluctuations in foreign currencies on daily basis, but now the government has successfully curbed the inflation and brought stability to the currency market.” Seif added: “Falling oil prices shocked oil-dependent countries – even those which were not affected by sanctions, like Iran – but we felt no shock in our economy thanks to good management and good planning of our financial policies.” David Lipton, a senior official with the IMF who visited Tehran recently, said Iran also needed to make efforts to reintegrate with the international financial system by strengthening the framework for anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism. “In recent years, the authorities have made considerable progress in restoring macroeconomic stability under difficult circumstances,” he said. “Inflation has declined from 45% in 2013 to around 8% recently, the foreign exchange market has stabilised, and some key reforms have been implemented.”"
"Iran's Revolutionary Guard attacks mock US aircraft carrier in naval drills","Associated Press in Tehran  Wed 25 Feb 2015 16.35 GMT   Last modified on Wed 25 Feb 2015 16.58 GMT   With rockets roaring and guns blazing, more than a dozen swarming Iranian speedboats assaulted a replica of a US aircraft carrier on Wednesday during large-scale naval drills near the strategically vital entrance of the Persian Gulf. The nationally televised show of force by the country’s elite Revolutionary Guard comes just weeks ahead of a deadline for Iran and world powers to forge a historic deal on the fate of the Islamic Republic’s nuclear program. Iranian live-fire war games are not uncommon. But by simulating for the first time an attack on the ultimate symbol of American naval power, hardliners hoped to send a message that Iran has no intention of backing down to the US – whichever way talks over its contested nuclear program go. “American aircraft carriers are very big ammunition depots housing a lot of missiles, rockets, torpedoes and everything else,” the Guard’s navy chief, Admiral Ali Fadavi, said on state television. A direct hit by a missile could set off a large secondary explosion, he added. Fadavi last month boasted that his force is capable of sinking American aircraft carriers in the event of war. He previously called carriers easy targets and said Iran naturally wants to sink them. The drill, named “Great Prophet 9”, was held near the Strait of Hormuz, through which about a fifth of the world’s oil passes. Iran’s regular army carried out naval drills near the strait in December. Tensions near the strait have caused oil prices to spike in the past – good news for producers like Iran. But traders seemed to take Wednesday’s maneuvers in stride, with benchmark US crude dipping slightly and continuing to hover below $50 a barrel by mid-morning. State TV showed footage of missiles fired from the coast and the fast boats striking the ersatz American carrier, which appeared to be a replica seen in a shipyard in the southern port of Bandar Abbas last year. The drills also included Guard forces shooting down a drone and planting undersea mines. Footage aired on Wednesday did not show that the assault had managed to sink the mock-up, but it was heavily damaged. The Guard’s chief commander, General Mohammad Ali Jafari, said the drills send a “message of [Iran’s] might” to “extraterritorial powers”, a reference to the United States. Commander Kevin Stephens, the spokesman for the US navy’s fifth fleet in Bahrain, said the Americans were monitoring the drills, which had no effect on maritime traffic. He downplayed the simulated attack on the carrier, saying the US military was “not concerned about this exercise”. “We’re quite confident of our naval forces’ ability to defend themselves,” he said. “It seems they’ve attempted to destroy the equivalent of a Hollywood movie set.” The US routinely stations at least one aircraft carrier and other warships in and around the Gulf. It and its allies conduct periodic naval exercises of their own in the region, including ones aimed at countering the threat from undersea mines that could be used to block ship traffic through the strait. The American aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson is currently deployed in the Gulf, as is the French carrier Charles de Gaulle. Planes from both vessels are carrying out airstrikes against the Islamic State group, which has seized roughly a third of Iraq and Syria. Iran backs Syria’s government and is supporting Iraq in its fight against the militants, but it is not part of the US-led international coalition against the extremist group. The drills were not publicly announced in advance, but the Guard has held similar military exercises around this time of year. The last one, in February 2013, featured “suicide drones” that attack enemies kamikaze-style. The Guard, which has a 200,000-strong force, is different from the regular army and is charged with protecting the ruling system. It also controls the paramilitary Basij militia, for which there are no precise personnel figures available. Iran put the Guard in charge of defending the country’s territorial Gulf waters in 2008 as Iran turned its attention toward beefing up its naval and air defense forces. Iran is currently negotiating an agreement over its disputed nuclear program with the United States and five other world powers in exchange for relief from crippling economic sanctions. The two sides hope to reach a framework agreement next month and a final deal in June. Western countries have long suspected Iran is covertly seeking a nuclear weapons capability – a charge Tehran denies. In a speech on Wednesday in the holy city of Qom, the moderate president, Hassan Rouhani, called for all sanctions to be lifted once a final nuclear accord is reached. “Our opposite negotiating party has to know that the end of these talks and the result of a deal must be lifting of the entire oppressive and illegal sanctions,” he said. “In the negotiations, we will not accept any imposition, humiliation or continuation of the sanctions.”"
"BDS: how a controversial non-violent movement has transformed the Israeli-Palestinian debate","Israel sees the international boycott campaign as an existential threat to the Jewish state. Palestinians regard it as their last resort. By  Nathan Thrall  Tue 14 Aug 2018 06.00 BST   Last modified on Fri 24 Aug 2018 12.00 BST   T he movement for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions against Israel – known as BDS – has been driving the world a little bit mad. Since its founding 13 years ago, it has acquired nearly as many enemies as the Israelis and Palestinians combined. It has hindered the efforts of Arab states to fully break their own decades-old boycott in pursuit of increasingly overt cooperation with Israel . It has shamed the Palestinian Authority government in Ramallah by denouncing its security and economic collaboration with Israel’s army and military administration. It has annoyed the Palestine Liberation Organization by encroaching on its position as the internationally recognised advocate and representative of Palestinians worldwide. It has infuriated the Israeli government by trying to turn it into a leper among liberals and progressives. It has exasperated what is left of the Israeli peace camp by nudging the Palestinians away from an anti-occupation struggle and towards an anti-apartheid one. It has induced such an anti-democratic counter-campaign by the Israeli government that it has made Israeli liberals fear for the future of their country. And it has caused major headaches for the Palestinians’ donor governments in Europe, which are pressured by Israel not to work with BDS-supporting organisations in the Palestinian territories , an impossible request given that nearly all major civil society groups in Gaza and the West Bank support the movement. In an era of corporate social responsibility, BDS has given bad publicity to major businesses tied up in Israel’s occupation ( Airbnb , Re/Max , HP ) and helped push other large firms out of the West Bank. It has disrupted film festivals, concerts and exhibitions around the world. It has riled academic and sports organisations by politicising them, demanding that they take a stand on the highly divisive conflict. It has angered Palestinian performers and artists who work with Israeli institutions, accusing them of giving Palestinian cover for Israel’s human rights violations. In the UK, BDS has brought turmoil to courts and local councils, embroiling them in disputes over the legality of local boycotts of settlement goods. In the US, BDS has caused two dozen states to pass bills or issue orders inhibiting or penalising those boycotting Israel or its settlements, pitting Israel’s allies against free speech advocates such as the American Civil Liberties Union. It has ignited debates in Protestant churches in the US, some of the largest of which have divested from companies that profit from Israel’s occupation. It has become the bane of college administrators, forced to adjudicate complaints from BDS-supporting professors and students that their free speech has been stifled, and claims by Zionist faculty, donors and undergraduates that their campuses have become “unsafe” spaces. It has pulled liberals toward greater support for the Palestinians, making Israel an increasingly partisan issue in the US, associated less with Democrats  and progressives than with Trump, evangelicals and the far right. In the Jewish diaspora, BDS has created new schisms on the centre-left, which has been forced into a vice by the rightwing and pro-settlement Israeli government on one hand, and the non-Zionist left on the other. It has prompted liberal Zionists to grapple with why they sometimes accept the boycott of products from settlements but not the boycott of the state that creates and sustains them. It has compelled Israel’s more critical supporters to justify their opposition to non-violent forms of pressure on Israel, when the absence of real pressure has done nothing to bring occupation or settlement expansion to an end. It has put the onus on liberal Zionists to defend their support not for the abstract ideal of what they hope Israel might one day become, but for the actual, longstanding practices of the state, including expropriations of Palestinian land for Jewish settlement; detention of hundreds of Palestinians without trial or charge; collective punishment of two million Gazans living under a more than decade-long blockade; and institutionalised inequality between Jewish and Palestinian citizens of Israel. BDS has deprived Israel’s liberal supporters of the excuse that an aberrant occupation or rightwing governments are mainly to blame for the state’s undemocratic practices. Perhaps most significantly, BDS has challenged the two-state consensus of the international community. In so doing it has upset the entire industry of Middle East peace process nonprofit organisations, diplomatic missions and think tanks by undermining their central premise: that the conflict can be resolved simply by ending Israel’s occupation of Gaza, East Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank, leaving the rights of Palestinian citizens of Israel and refugees unaddressed. For many diaspora Jews, BDS has become a symbol of evil and repository of dread, a nefarious force transforming the Israel-Palestine debate from a negotiation over the end of the occupation and the division of territory into an argument about the conflict’s older and deeper roots: the original displacement of most of the Palestinians, and, on the ruins of their conquered villages, the establishment of a Jewish state. The emergence of the BDS movement has revived old questions about the legitimacy of Zionism, how to justify the privileging of Jewish over non-Jewish rights, and why refugees can return to their homes in other conflicts but not in this one. Above all, it has underscored an awkward issue that cannot be indefinitely neglected: whether Israel, even if it were to cease its occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, can be both a democracy and a Jewish state. I n the Old City of Bethlehem, down an arched pathway near the souk and Manger Square, there stands a centuries-old limestone building that now serves as the headquarters of Holy Land Trust, a Palestinian organisation devoted to nonviolent resistance to Israeli rule. Sami Awad, the non-profit’s founder, has an office on the top floor; lining his shelves are books by leading theorists and practitioners of protest and civil disobedience: Gene Sharp, Mahatma Gandhi, Nelson Mandela and Martin Luther King Jr, all of whom figure prominently in his teaching, writing and even casual speech. Awad meets often with delegations of Israeli and American Jews; unlike many Palestinian activists, he does not shy from discussing the Jewish connection to this land: “I can deny it till kingdom come. But it’s very deep and very emotional.” At the same time, he speaks candidly of occupation and racism, and he insists that Israel will not give Palestinians freedom unless forced to. “No oppressor group ever decides on their own just to be morally correct and change their behaviour,” he told me. “Something needs to happen: activism, resistance, boycott.” Jews and Arabs have been boycotting one another since the early days of Zionism. In the decades before Israel’s founding, the mainstream Zionist movement waged campaigns to boycott Arab workers, reject Arab produce, exclude Arabs from Jewish-only residential communities and forbid Arab purchase of Jewish-owned land. The fifth Palestine Arab Congress called for a boycott of Jewish goods in 1922. After Israel occupied the West Bank and Gaza in 1967, Palestinian lawyers boycotted Israeli courts, and teachers went on strike under the slogan, “no education under occupation”. Israel responded to these and other acts of civil disobedience with arrests, fines, travel restrictions, shop closures, curfews and deportations of teachers, lawyers, mayors and university presidents. Sami’s uncle, Mubarak Awad, was a pioneer of Palestinian nonviolent resistance in the 1980s: Mubarak encouraged Palestinians to send back bills written solely in Hebrew, to refuse court summonses and to fly the Palestinian flag, which was cause for arrest. Inspired by Gandhi’s boycott of British cloth, he urged the replacement of Israeli products with Palestinian ones. But it wasn’t until the first intifada, the popular uprising against occupation that began in 1987, that the programme Mubarak and others advocated found its chance for full expression. Tactics he had championed in small classrooms and academic journals were now put into widespread use by a popular movement backed by major political parties: consumers boycotted Israeli goods and services, labourers in Israeli industries refused to work, shops closed down in unison, customers withdrew funds from Israeli banks, residents refused to pay taxes and most of the Palestinian tax collectors and police resigned. The Bank of Israel reported that the Palestinian boycott had cost Israel $650m ($1.4bn today) during the first year of the uprising alone. Mubarak was charged with “fomenting a rebellion against the state”; like dozens of others, he was deported by Israel during the first year of the intifada. Sami Awad was sent by his parents to Kansas in order to continue his studies. When he returned to Bethlehem in 1996, it had been transformed by the Oslo peace process. Tens of thousands of PLO officials and fighters had moved from exile in the Arab world to the West Bank and Gaza, and were now functionaries in the newly established Palestinian administration. A culture of resistance had been replaced by one of coexistence. A peace industry now flourished, as foreign funds flowed in to finance dialogue groups, NGOs and people-to-people initiatives. Awad, like most Palestinians, was optimistic that peace was on the horizon. Within two years, his optimism faded. The nascent Palestinian administration established following the 1993 Oslo accord seemed less a burgeoning democracy that would lead to an independent country in the West Bank and Gaza than a growing police state. He heard no end of talk of peace and coexistence, but what he saw on the ground was increased segregation and limitations on his freedom. The Palestinian autonomous areas in the West Bank were small, disconnected islands, 165 of them, each surrounded by a sea of territory under Israeli control. Within that sea – the 60% of the West Bank that is off limits to the Palestinian government – Israel confiscated land for settlement, demolished Palestinian buildings and provided financial incentives for the settler population to grow. If Oslo was the road to a two-state solution, Awad was beginning to wonder if the destination was one he wanted to reach. When the second intifada erupted, in September 2000, with Palestinian suicide bombings and Israeli invasions and missile attacks, the dialogue and peacemaking activities of groups such as Holy Land Trust came to a halt. For Awad, the focus was now on nonviolent resistance, which was then neither popular nor simple. It was the bloodiest period of Israeli-Palestinian fighting since the 1948 war. More than 3,000 Palestinians and 1,000 Israelis were killed. The militarisation of the intifada had made it dangerous to confront Israel in any manner, including peacefully. Yet Awad and other activists still managed to carve out a small space for nonviolent resistance. He demonstrated against land confiscation in the West Bank and, after 2002, the building of what Israelis refer to as a security fence and Palestinians came to call the apartheid wall. The barrier – a mix of eight-metre-high concrete slabs, fences and barbed wire – cut through the West Bank and Jerusalem, dividing Palestinians from one another and villagers from their land. The barrier effectively annexed nearly 10% of the West Bank to Israel. In occupied East Jerusalem, up to a third of the Palestinian residents were walled off from their schools, health clinics and workplaces. Dense crowds of Jerusalemites and West Bankers could be seen at 4 and 5am, packed like cattle as they inched through caged checkpoints to get to the other side of the wall. As the violence of the second intifada escalated, a campaign of international solidarity with Palestinians grew. In the first months of the uprising, students at the University of California in Berkeley erected mock checkpoints and brandished banners calling to “Divest from Israeli Apartheid”. Harvard faculty signed a divestment petition in 2002. In Durban, South Africa, alongside a contentious UN-sponsored World Conference Against Racism, representatives of some 3,000 NGOs called on “the international community to impose a policy of complete and total isolation of Israel as an apartheid state”. Boycott and divestment campaigns spread across US, UK and European campuses, gaining the support of several Israeli academics and large numbers of Palestinians. In the West Bank and Gaza, international and Israeli activists streamed in to offer their support. Their presence tended to make the Israeli army act more cautiously, which provided a measure of protection to Palestinian demonstrators. Awad still worked with Israelis, but now insisted that any cooperation be premised not on coexistence but co-resistance, with Palestinians in the lead. He was tear-gassed, beaten and detained alongside members of direct action groups such as the International Solidarity Movement, Christian Peacemaker Teams and the Israeli-led Anarchists Against the Wall. After a week or more among Palestinian villagers, the foreign activists would return to their campuses, church groups and labour unions, explaining that there was a little-noticed Palestinian nonviolent resistance movement – and that it could be supported through divestment and boycott. The first divestment by a US institution of higher education, Hampshire College – also the first US school to have divested from South Africa – was spearheaded by an Israeli undergraduate named Matan Cohen, who at 17 had been shot in the eye by Israeli forces during a demonstration against the separation barrier. The nonviolent activism of the second intifada was a prelude to what would become a worldwide boycott campaign. T he Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement was founded with a statement of principles, known as the BDS call, on 9 July 2005. It represented something of a last resort. The Palestinians had been crushed by the military defeat of the second intifada. The living embodiment of the Palestinian national movement, Yasser Arafat, was dead. His newly installed replacement, Mahmoud Abbas, was identified more than any other Palestinian with the Oslo peace process. Though Abbas’s leadership seemed to offer a respite from the violence, it also promised a return to a strategy of diplomacy and cooperation that had done little to bring occupation to an end. If there was going to be pressure on Israel to give Palestinians freedom, it was going to have to come from the grassroots and the outside. The BDS call was made on the one-year anniversary of a historic advisory opinion by the international court of justice. The court ruled that Israel’s separation barrier was illegal, that Israel had to dismantle it “forthwith” and offer reparations to those it had harmed, and that every signatory to the fourth Geneva convention – meaning nearly every state in the world – was under an obligation to ensure Israel complied with international humanitarian law. But Israel ignored the ruling, and neither the PLO nor the international community made a real attempt to enforce the court’s findings. “If there had been action on the part of the international community to implement the ICJ ruling,” Ingrid Jaradat, a founding member of the BDS campaign, told me, “there wouldn’t have been a BDS call.” More than 170 Palestinian organisations from the occupied territories, Israel and the diaspora endorsed the BDS call. They spanned the political spectrum – leftists and Islamists, supporters of two states and of one. They included the Palestinian National and Islamic Forces – the coordinating body for every significant political party – as well as major trade unions, refugee camp committees, prisoners’ societies, artistic and cultural centres and nonviolent resistance groups, among them Sami Awad’s Holy Land Trust. Twenty-nine of these entities now form the BDS National Committee, or BNC, a leadership council. The chief innovation of the BDS call was not in the tactics that it advocated: boycott and divestment campaigns were already pervasive in 2005, and even sanctions and arms embargoes had been proposed previously, including by the UN general assembly. What was new about BDS was that it took disparate campaigns to pressure Israel and united them around three clear demands, with one for each major component of the Palestinian people. First, freedom for the residents of the occupied territories; second, equality for the Palestinian citizens of Israel; and third, justice for Palestinian refugees in the diaspora – the largest group – including the right to return to their homes. The BDS call was a challenge not simply to Israel but to the Palestinian leadership. It represented a conceptual reframing of the national struggle, more in line with the original positions of the PLO – before it had been forced by military defeat, international pressure and political pragmatism to abandon the goal of a single democratic state, acquiescing to a two-state compromise instead. The world powers had presented a two-state solution as a gift to Palestinians. But for Palestinians, the gift was clearly to Israel, for they saw it as the indigenous people relinquishing 78% of their land. Arabs had made up more than 90% of the population at the dawn of Zionism, in the late 19th century, and over two-thirds of it in 1948, prior to Israel’s war of independence. That year, the territory of what would become Israel was emptied of 80% of its Palestinian inhabitants, who were then prevented from returning to their homes. The PLO was founded some 16 years later, in 1964, before there was any Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza. It was the liberation of the entire homeland and the return of its original inhabitants that had been the core objective of the Palestinian cause. By the first intifada and the 1993 Oslo accord that brought it to an end, however, many Palestinians were ready to accept the two-state formula, not because it was seen as fair, but because it was the most they could then hope to get. As the details of various peace proposals emerged, though, the deal sounded more and more rotten. The Palestinians would have to relinquish not just 78% of their homeland, but also the land taken up by major Israeli settlements within the occupied territories. They would have to give up sovereignty in large parts of occupied East Jerusalem, their future capital, and of the Old City that falls entirely within it. They would have to agree that any peace treaty would not allow the return of most refugees to their homes, unlike almost any other peace accord signed since Israelis and Palestinians first negotiated a draft final agreement in 1995. They would have to renounce all claims on Israel – including any demand for equal rights for its Palestinian citizens, who were more than one-fifth of the population. And in exchange they would get a West Bank-Gaza state that Israeli prime ministers, from Yitzhak Rabin to Benjamin Netanyahu, described as a “state-minus” or “an entity which is less than a state”. During negotiations with Israel, the PLO had agreed to each of these concessions, though few if any of them were supported by international law. When even these accommodations eventually proved insufficient to obtain an end to the occupation, growing numbers of Palestinians started to sour on the idea of two states. It wasn’t simply that the original two-state compromise had been eroded to the point of unrecognisability. It was that even the whittled-down version now seemed like a mirage. At the time of the BDS call, Israel’s occupation of the West Bank and Gaza was nearly four decades old, and showed no signs of disappearing. The number of settlers had nearly doubled since Oslo, reaching almost half a million in 2005. Many of them resided not in hilltop caravans, but in cities with shopping malls, parks, public pools and multi-lane highways connecting them seamlessly to Israel. The idea of removing even a third of this steadily growing population had come to sound implausible. The US and other powers did little more than wag their fingers. They promised the Palestinians that the situation would soon end with the founding of an independent state. Over time, the two-state solution became a slogan emptied of meaning. The less plausible it seemed, the louder it was proclaimed. But so long as it could still be imagined, the major world powers refused to demand that Israel grant the Palestinians citizenship and equal rights. The two-state concept was thus transformed from a possible solution to Israeli occupation to the primary pretext for depriving Palestinians of equality. It was also the main excuse for keeping the majority of Palestinians in exile: in order to preserve Israel’s Jewish majority, the refugees would have to languish in camps outside Israel’s borders until there was a Palestinian state that could absorb them. The BDS movement offered an alternative. It rejected talk of fictive solutions, whether of two states or one. The most fundamental problem, in its view, was not in deciding what sort of arrangement should replace the current system; the problem was forcing Israel to change it at all. Debating two states versus one amounted to counting angels on the point of a pin, so long as Israel was comfortable enough in perpetual occupation to prefer it to either one. I srael’s response to BDS was slow in coming, but forceful once it arrived. Yossi Kuperwasser, who goes by the nickname Kuper, led the Israeli government’s efforts against the BDS movement until 2014. He now works for the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, a conservative thinktank run by Dore Gold, a former Israeli ambassador to the UN and a longtime confidante of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. Kuperwasser, who has a grown-out buzz cut, a gruff voice and the Israeli habit of filling pauses with a grumbling “ehh”, is an engaging and emphatic interlocutor. He has good Arabic, as does his wife, Tsionit (“Zionist” in Hebrew), who was born in Israel to Iraqi Jewish parents. Kuper headed the prestigious research division of military intelligence during the second intifada, and was appointed director general of the Ministry of Strategic Affairs in 2009. It was Kuperwasser who turned the ministry into Israel’s command centre for what he calls the battle against BDS. He began the job just after the 2008-2009 Gaza war, which had killed 13 Israelis and around 1,400 Palestinians, lifting BDS activity to new heights. In September 2009, Israel’s international standing was dealt a heavy blow by the UN’s report on the war, written by a fact-finding mission headed by the eminent South African jurist Richard Goldstone. It found that Israel and Palestinian armed groups had committed war crimes, and that Israel had conducted “deliberate attacks on civilians” with “the intention of spreading terror”. It also determined that the ongoing blockade of Gaza – “the series of acts that deprive Palestinians … of their means of subsistence, employment, housing and water, that deny their freedom of movement and their right to leave and enter their own country” – constituted a possible crime against humanity. Kuperwasser said it was the Goldstone report that first alerted Israel to the grave nature of the threat posed by what it calls “delegitimisation”. In late 2009, Netanyahu identified delegitimisation as one of three critical threats to Israel, alongside Iran’s nuclear programme and the proliferation of rockets and missiles in Gaza and Lebanon. Since then, it has become common to hear senior Israeli politicians describe BDS and delegitimisation as an “existential” or “strategic” threat. Some of Israel’s centre-left commentators, all of whom oppose BDS, have nevertheless taken a rather cynical view of the government’s international campaign against BDS. They believe it is driven primarily by domestic politics. They point out that since the founding of BDS 13 years ago, Israel’s trade with the outside world has actually increased, and its diplomatic ties with India, China, African states and even the Arab world have grown. Many mainstream Israeli commentators see the BDS movement and Israeli politicians of the left and right working in symbiosis: the Israeli left threatens that BDS and delegitimisation will create an international “diplomatic tsunami” against Israel; the Israeli right does its usual scaremongering about external threats in order to drum up support at home and abroad. The BDS movement, meanwhile, eagerly points to every hyperbolic Israeli statement as evidence of its own success. Kuperwasser, however, says the threat BDS poses is very real, and that ignoring it or treating it as a nuisance will fail: “Until 2010, we tried this policy, and the results were not good.” More important, he said, measuring the impact of BDS in terms of Israel’s trade was fundamentally mistaken. “The core issue is not whether they are going to boycott us or not boycott us,” Kuperwasser said. “The core issue is whether they are going to be successful in implanting in the international discourse that Israel is illegitimate as a Jewish state.” M ore than 20% of Israel’s 8.8 million citizens are Palestinian. They are the remaining survivors and descendants of the minority who stayed within Israel’s borders during the 1948 war. Haneen Zoabi, a 49-year-old Palestinian citizen of Israel, from Nazareth, has been a member of Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, since 2009, and is a vocal supporter of BDS. She is Israel’s fiercest critic in the Knesset, where she regularly denounces Israeli policies toward the Palestinians and accuses Israel of being an apartheid state. YouTube is filled with videos of her standing calmly at the dais, attempting to speak as she is interrupted and heckled by enraged Israeli parliamentarians, some of whom have screamed out epithets such as “traitor!” or “Go to Gaza!” A leading Likud MK, Miri Regev, called for her to be deported. Zoabi has been subjected to a criminal investigation for incitement and suspended from the Knesset several times, most recently in March, for referring to the killing of Palestinians by the Israeli army as murder. While Israel allows Palestinian citizens like Zoabi to vote and hold office, the state has always treated land ownership by its Palestinian citizens as a threat, and has implemented official government plans to “Judaize” Arab areas and dilute the Palestinian presence. After the 1948 war, only 20% of the Palestinians in the territory that would become Israel remained, and a quarter of those were internally displaced. Israel put its Palestinian citizens under the curfews and restrictions of military government until 1966, confiscated roughly half their land, and passed laws that have prevented them from reclaiming it to this day. Tens of thousands of Palestinians reside in villages that predate the existence of Israel but are considered “unrecognised” by the state, facing demolitions and forcible evictions while receiving few to no basic services, including water and electricity. With the state limiting the development and expansion of Arab towns, Palestinian citizens have been forced to bid on properties in Jewish communities. But they have been repeatedly blocked. Hundreds of Jewish-only communities in Israel have admissions committees that are legally permitted to reject applicants on the basis of “social suitability”, providing cover for excluding non-Jews. “What we Palestinians in Israel face is apartheid, not discrimination,” Zoabi said. “Israel tries to say, ‘We are good Israel that has to do bad things in the West Bank and Gaza.’ No, look at how Israel treats its own citizens who don’t throw a stone!” Israel’s longstanding policies of inequality were given additional backing in the form of a July 2018 “basic law” – Israel’s version of constitutional laws – that downgrades the status of the Arabic language, states that only Jews have a right to self-determination in Israel, and declares: “The state views the development of Jewish settlement as a national value and will act to encourage and promote its establishment and consolidation.” Zoabi said the PLO had forsaken its responsibilities to the Palestinian people. After formally committing to two separate states in 1988, she said, “the PLO effectively conceded Israel as a Jewish state”, with inequality between Jews and non-Jews enshrined in its laws. It was now mainly the Palestinian citizens of Israel who really challenged Zionism itself, she said, by insisting that the state could not truly be both democratic and Jewish. As a result, Palestinian citizens of Israel had become a “much bigger threat to Israel than the PLO”. She continued: “The PLO defined our struggle” – the struggle of Palestinian citizens for equality – “as an internal Israeli issue. They abandoned us!” Zoabi harshly criticized the Palestinian leadership for its role in prolonging the occupation. She blamed Mahmoud Abbas, the PLO chairman and PA president also known as Abu Mazen, for the fact that the US president Donald Trump had decided to break with decades of US policy and recognise Jerusalem as Israel’s capital last December. “Trump made a calculation,” she told me. “What will be the reaction to my move? All of Israel and the US said to him, correctly, that Abu Mazen will not change the rules of the game, will not end security cooperation with Israel, and will not stop Oslo. So what price will Israel or the US pay?” Zoabi said that when she travelled abroad, to countries such as Ireland, Germany and the US, “officials there told me: ‘The PLO ambassador is against your position on BDS. So who am I supposed to believe?’” Like the PLO, Zoabi is highly critical of Israel’s occupation, but she believes the real roots of the conflict are in Israel’s historic treatment of Palestinians. “The problem is not the occupation, the problem is the Zionist project,” she said. “Israel fears that if people had open minds and saw what Israel was doing to the Palestinians, it would be the end. The minute you say that Israel is not a normal state – that it is not a democratic state that makes some mistakes, but an abnormal state, acting against human rights – then you are breaking its image as liberal, humane, [with] the most moral army in the world. BDS is eroding Israel’s standing.” D espite their totally opposing goals, the Israeli right and the leaders of the BDS movement agree on quite a lot. Both assert that at its heart the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is over Zionism and the forced exile of the majority of Palestinians in 1948, not Israel’s 1967 conquest of Gaza, East Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank. Both contend that the settlements should not be treated differently from the government that created them. Both believe that the demands of Palestinian citizens of Israel for equality and of refugees for return are central issues of dispute, which were given insufficient attention by past peacemakers. Both say that Israel’s battle against BDS is not primarily an economic struggle. Both view the BDS movement as representative of mainstream Palestinian demands, despite acknowledging that the movement cannot mobilise large crowds and its main activists are not important figures in Palestinian politics. And both believe that the BDS movement will expose the true nature of the conflict to the world. But whereas the BDS movement is betting that this exposure will lead people to conclude that Zionism is fundamentally racist and should be rejected, Kuperwasser, for one, is convinced it is the Palestinians who will be unmasked. “The Palestinians are taking a very big risk,” he said. “Because, in my mind, there is a good chance that the world will deny their conceptual framework. People will say: ‘This is what the Palestinians want?! We are totally against it … They are crazy; they want Israel to disappear.’” If that happens, he added, the Palestinians won’t even get a West Bank-Gaza state, which he believes the PLO still sees as merely the first stage toward liberating all of Palestine. In Kuperwasser’s view, the BDS movement and the Palestinian leadership share the same goals; the differences between them are merely a matter of tactics. “Abu Mazen understands more than the BDS movement that you have to be subtle,” he said. The PLO’s acceptance of a two-state solution, its vows to take into account Israel’s demographic concerns, its silence on the rights of Palestinian citizens of Israel – all of these, Kuperwasser added, were merely a subterfuge designed to obtain a West Bank-Gaza state, which would then serve as a launching pad for continued struggle. “The Palestinian idea of struggle is so deeply embedded in their mind that they cannot actually think about the possibility of giving up the struggle in order to make peace. I cannot tell you how many Palestinians I told, ‘Listen, with this struggle, you are paying the price much more than we do. We are flourishing. Even if we pay a price, we are flourishing.’” The key for Israel, he said, was winning the hearts and minds of centrist liberals and progressives abroad, not people who are already in the Zionist or anti-Zionist camps. What had made it more difficult, he said, was that some Israelis and Jews were guilty of “negligence and intentional giving up of the battlefield” – not the radical left, but centrists who had naively adopted the language of the enemy. Kuperwasser singled out the former Labor party prime minister Ehud Barak, who had repeatedly warned that Israel is “on a slippery slope toward apartheid” – a warning that has also been made by the former foreign minister Tzipi Livni and the former prime ministers Ehud Olmert and Yitzhak Rabin. For Kuperwasser, these statements, intended to convince Israelis to make territorial concessions for peace, were above all a gift to its enemies. F or the BDS movement, the charge of apartheid, which became prominent after the start of the second intifada in 2000, was not merely a provocative analogy to South Africa but a legal claim, based on the crime of apartheid as defined in international conventions and the founding statute of the international criminal court: “an institutionalised regime of systematic oppression and domination by one racial group over any other racial group or groups and committed with the intention of maintaining that regime”. The concept of apartheid became central to the BDS movement’s framing of the conflict. Whereas the Palestinian Authority sought to accentuate its autonomy and state-like characteristics, the BDS movement underlined the PA’s subservience to Israel. For proponents of the two-state model, the PA was a nationalist project working toward eventual independence, while in the apartheid framework it was merely an Israeli satrap. BDS leaders emphasised the de facto “one-state reality” of Israel-Palestine – which had become a common trope even among Israel’s supporters, many of whom were dismayed at the possibility that the country could eventually be forced to enfranchise the Palestinians living under occupation and thereby cease to be a Jewish state. Increasingly among both Israel’s centre-left friends and its enemies, the idea of a single state was not a plan for the future – to be sought or averted – but an accurate description of the reality on the ground, which was becoming more and more difficult to disentangle. Jews were already a minority in the territory under the control of Israel, which regulated the Palestinians’ borders, exports and imports, customs revenues and permits for travel and work. Legally, commercially and administratively, the Jewish and Palestinian populations were interlaced. The more deeply entrenched this one-state reality became, the more resonant the charge of apartheid, and the more difficult to imagine undoing it through partition into two states. A battle against occupation could be concluded with a simple military withdrawal, but a struggle against apartheid could be won only with the end of state policies that discriminated against non-Jews. In the case of Israel, these could be found not just in the occupied territories, but everywhere Palestinians came into contact with the state. In the West Bank, Palestinians were denied the right to vote for the government controlling their lives, deprived of free assembly and movement, forbidden from equal access to roads, resources and territory, and imprisoned indefinitely without charge. In Gaza, they could not exit, enter, import, export or even approach their borders without the permission of Israel or its ally, Egypt. In Jerusalem, they were segregated from one another and encircled by checkpoints and walls. In Israel, they were evicted from their lands, prevented from reclaiming their expropriated homes, and blocked from residing in communities inhabited exclusively by Jews. In the diaspora, they were prevented from reunifying with their families in Israel-Palestine or returning to their homes, solely because they were not Jews. Though in public, world leaders spoke endlessly of a two-state solution, privately many doubted it was still possible. They regularly condemned settlements (since these, unlike occupation, were illegal), but they did nothing to reverse settlement growth. They called for Palestinians to have freedom, but not through equal rights and citizenship in one state – because, among other reasons, international law forbids Israel from annexing territory acquired by force. They saw Israel was subverting a two-state solution and taking measures to deprive Palestinians of rights. But they wouldn’t exert any real pressure on Israel so long as it mouthed an intention to one day grant Palestinians some limited form of independence. Israel was thereby allowed to hold all the land while excluding the majority of its indigenous people, just as South Africa had aspired to do. In redefining the conflict as a case of apartheid, BDS activists saw a way out of this trap. The apartheid rubric could also undo the Palestinians’ greatest weakness – fragmentation – by uniting them in a common struggle against a single, discriminatory regime. In Gaza this January, I met Haidar Eid, a professor of literature at Al-Azhar University and a co-founder of the BDS movement in Gaza. He is in his mid-50s, compact, with a scruffy grey beard and short curly hair, and a fondness for knitted turtlenecks. Eid said that he had never seen such strain on the people of Gaza. It was weeks before Gazans would launch the Great March of Return, the weekly protests along the Gaza border fence in which Israeli snipers killed more than 100 unarmed demonstrators and wounded several thousand more. Along with tens of thousands of other public employees, Eid’s salary at the university had been cut by more than half, and he was looking for a second job. Over 40% of Gazans, including most young people, were unemployed. Eid scheduled much of his life around when the elevator for his 10th-floor apartment would be working, since Gaza had only six to eight hours of electricity per day. Scarce power prevented the full treatment of sewage, tens of millions of litres of which were dumped each day, raw, into fetid ponds and the sea. Like more than two-thirds of Gaza’s population, Eid and his family are refugees from a village in present-day Israel. He opposed the Oslo agreement because it ignored Palestinian refugees. “Oslo,” he said, “reduced the Palestinian people to residents of the West Bank and Gaza.” But it was refugees who founded the Palestinian national movement, and who accounted for the majority of Palestinians worldwide. He said, “The Palestinian issue is one thing: the right of return.” Eid’s village, Zarnuqa, was purged of its Palestinian inhabitants and no longer stands. Throughout Israel the land of refugees remains largely empty or sparsely populated, such that prominent researchers, such as the Palestinian historian Salman Abu Sitta, estimate that most could return without displacing Israelis. Eid noted that a two-state solution meant precluding most refugees from returning, since Israel refuses any possible threat to its Jewish demographic majority. (There is a myth propagated by some of Israel’s supporters that Palestinians are the only people who pass on refugee status to their children. On this basis, the Trump administration and its allies in Congress have sought to cut UN assistance to millions of Palestinian refugees born after the 1948 war. In fact, granting refugee status to stateless descendants is standard practice throughout the world. The majority of registered Afghan refugees, for example, are second- and third-generation, born outside the country, as are most who have returned to Afghanistan in recent years.) Eid spent six years in Johannesburg, where he obtained his doctorate, and his English has traces of a South African accent. He compared Gaza and the Palestinian refugee camps outside Israel’s borders to the Bantustans in which black South Africans were confined under apartheid; it was his view that a two-state solution would not end apartheid but rather consolidate it, creating an enfeebled, discontiguous West Bank-Gaza state that would have a dubious claim to independence. To Eid, the two-state solution was an essentially racist proposal, because it was designed to preserve a Jewish ethnic majority, with legally sanctioned discrimination against non-Jews. He preferred a single, democratic, non-racial, non-religious state, which he said was a “huge compromise for Palestinians”, because it would give “citizenship and forgiveness to settlers and occupiers”. Eid objected to the PLO’s insincere threats to seek such an outcome, which he wrote off as a misguided attempt to scare the Israelis into accepting ethnic partition: “I mean, equality is not scary! If you are against equality and justice, you are against human rights.” Relying on states to behave morally was a lost cause, he argued; they needed to be pressured by their own people from below, through BDS activism by civil society. He recalled that it had taken more than 30 years for the international community to heed the calls for boycott, divestment and sanctions against apartheid South Africa, whose violent overreaction to indigenous resistance had been a prime driver of international solidarity. Just as the boycotts against South Africa had been stoked by the apartheid regime’s killings of protesters, Eid said, “the growth of BDS has been paved in Gaza’s blood. Every massacre we have in Gaza convinces me more that the only hope we have is popular resistance and BDS.” T hough BDS has not had a major economic impact on Israel so far, compared to the decades-long campaign in South Africa, its ascent has been rather steep. Institutional investors such as the Dutch pension fund PGGM and the United Methodist Church have withdrawn from Israeli banks. The Presbyterian Church, the United Church of Christ, and Norway’s largest private pension fund have divested from companies profiting from Israel’s occupation. And major firms such as Veolia, Orange, G4S and CRH have fully or mostly pulled out of Israel following boycott campaigns. Dozens of student governments and numerous academic associations have endorsed boycott and divestment initiatives. And many musicians and artists have cancelled shows or pledged to boycott the country. No less important, the BDS movement has effectively won the argument inside Palestine: whereas Abu Mazen had stated, in 2013, that while the PLO supports settlement boycotts, “we do not support the boycott of Israel” because “we have relations with Israel, we have mutual recognition of Israel”, by 2018 the PLO had at least rhetorically adopted BDS. International organisations, too, have been influenced by the BDS movement to move slowly from ineffectual condemnations to calls for practical measures that have some teeth. Last summer, Amnesty International called for a worldwide ban on settlement products and an arms embargo on Israel and Palestinian armed groups. Human Rights Watch called on institutional investors in Israeli banks to ensure that they are not contributing to or benefiting from settlements and other violations of international law. And the UN human rights office has compiled a list of over 200 companies – the majority based in Israel or the occupied territories, 22 based in the US – that are linked to the establishment, expansion or maintenance of Israeli settlements. In what is expected to be the most significant development in the 13-year-old BDS campaign, the UN human rights office plans to publish the names of these companies later this year. Nearly all of the corporate and student-led divestments have been selective: they have not targeted Israel as a whole, but only settlements and occupation. A number of them had little to do with the BDS movement itself. But both the Israeli government and the BDS movement have tended to obscure this fact. Doing so has helped the BDS movement appear to rack up victories, and it has helped the Israeli government to discredit cautious bureaucratic initiatives to adhere to international law, casting them instead as unhinged, demonising efforts by BDS radicals. Conflating boycotts of the settlements with opposition to Israel’s existence has been a central element of the government’s policy, reflecting a desire not just to protect settlements but to stem the tide of selective boycotts that could spread to Israel as a whole. “We are saying there is no difference between a settlement boycott and a boycott of Israel,” Yossi Kuperwasser said. “If you want to promote the boycotting of Israel, any part of Israel, you are not a friend of Israel. You are actually an enemy of Israel. So we have to deal with you.” The government has passed a law that bars entry to foreigners who have publicly supported a boycott of Israel “or an area under its control”. Its minister of strategic affairs has called for imposing financial penalties on Israeli organisations, companies and in some cases individuals who advocate boycotts of either Israel or the settlements. After Hagai El-Ad, the head of the Israeli human rights organisation B’Tselem, addressed the UN security council and called on it to take action against Israel’s occupation, the chairman of the governing coalition called to revoke his citizenship and to create a bill that would do the same to any Israeli who calls on international bodies to take action against Israel. Israel and its allies have pursued the same strategy abroad. In 2014, Netanyahu convened a meeting of top Israeli ministers to discuss possible counter-BDS measures, including, according to the Israeli daily Haaretz, “legal suits in European and North American courts against [BDS] organisations”, “legal action against financial institutions that boycott settlements”, and “whether to activate the pro-Israel lobby in the US, specifically Aipac, in order to promote legislation in Congress”. Since then, major banks around the world have shut down the accounts of pro-BDS groups. In 24 US states, bills and orders that stifle free speech by discouraging, penalising or restricting support for boycotts of Israel or of settlements have been passed, and have been challenged in two states so far by the ACLU. Following Hurricane Harvey, last summer, the city of Dickinson, Texas required residents who wanted relief to certify that they do not and will not boycott Israel , a demand the ACLU’s Texas legal director called “an egregious violation of the first amendment, reminiscent of McCarthy-era loyalty oaths”. A federal anti-boycott bill supported by Aipac has also met with opposition by the ACLU, which argues that “political boycotts are fully protected by the first amendment”, regardless of whether the boycott is of Israel or the settlements. This deliberate elision of Israel and the settlements has caused no small amount of consternation among the state’s more liberal supporters in the American Jewish community. For years they have sought to protect Israel itself from sanction, by arguing that only boycotts of settlements are legitimate. Now they feel themselves under attack not just from BDS, on the left, but the Israeli government, on the right, both of which disdain the centre-left notion of being “pro-Israel and anti-occupation”, and both of which reject the position that wine produced in West Bank settlements should be boycotted while the government that created, financed and maintained the settlements should not. Israel’s strategy has been to force a choice on companies subjected to pressure to withdraw or divest: stay in Israeli-controlled territory and ignore the boycott campaign, or accede to its demands and face potential lawsuits and losses in much bigger markets in Europe and the US. Given that choice, Kuperwasser said, most companies would be very reluctant to withdraw from Israel or the settlements: “But if it’s going to happen, there are going to be more laws around the world that are going to make these companies suffer. We can retaliate and come up with a response.” The Ministry of Strategic Affairs has outsourced much of its anti-BDS activity in foreign countries, helping to establish and finance front groups and partner organisations, in an attempt to minimise the appearance of Israeli interference in the domestic politics of its allies in Europe and the US. Kuper said that anti-BDS groups were now “sprouting like mushrooms after the rain”. He and a number of other former intelligence and security officials are members of one of them, Kella Shlomo, described as a “PR commando unit” that will work with and receive tens of millions of dollars from the Ministry of Strategic Affairs. In 2016, Israel’s embassy in London sent a cable to Jerusalem complaining that the strategic affairs ministry was endangering British Jewish organisations, most of which are registered as charities and forbidden from political activity: “‘operating’ Jewish organisations directly from Jerusalem … is liable to be dangerous” and “could encounter opposition from the organisations themselves, given their legal status; Britain isn’t the US!” Last year, al-Jazeera aired undercover recordings of an Israeli official working out of the London embassy, who described being asked by the Ministry of Strategic Affairs to help establish a “private company” in the UK that would work for the Israeli government and in liaison with pro-Israel groups like Aipac. To Israeli liberals, the gravest threat from BDS is that it has induced in their government a reaction so reckless and overreaching that it resembles a sort of auto-immune disease, in which the battle against BDS also damages the rights of ordinary citizens and the organs of democracy. Israel’s Ministry of Strategic Affairs has utilised the intelligence services to surveil and attack delegitimisers of Israel. It called to establish a blacklist of Israeli organisations and citizens who support the nonviolent boycott campaign, created a “tarnishing unit” to besmirch the reputations of boycott supporters, and placed paid articles in the Israeli press. Leftwing Israeli Jews have been summoned for interrogation or stopped at the border by agents of the Shin Bet, Israel’s internal security agency, who described themselves as officers working against delegitimisation. Israel has banned 20 organisations from entry for their political opinions, including the American Friends Service Committee, a Quaker group that won a Nobel peace prize for helping Holocaust refugees and that now supports self-determination for Israelis and Palestinians while also endorsing BDS. Last year, the Israeli intelligence minister, Yisrael Katz, called publicly for “targeted civil assassinations” of activists such as the BDS co-founder Omar Barghouti, a permanent resident of Israel. Barghouti was also threatened by Israel’s minister of public security and strategic affairs: “Soon any activist who uses their influence to delegitimise the only Jewish state in the world will know they will pay a price for it … We will soon be hearing more of our friend Barghouti.” Not long after, Barghouti was prevented from exiting the country, and last year Israeli authorities searched his home and arrested him for tax evasion. P erhaps Israel’s most powerful tool in the campaign against delegitimisation has been to accuse the country’s critics of antisemitism. Doing so required changing official definitions of the term. This effort began during the final years of the second intifada, in 2003 and 2004, as pre-BDS calls to boycott and divest from Israel were gaining steam. At that time, a group of institutes and experts, including Dina Porat – a Tel Aviv University scholar who had a been a member of the Israeli foreign ministry’s delegation to the 2001 UN world conference against racism in Durban, South Africa – proposed creating a new definition of antisemitism that would equate criticisms of Israel with hatred of Jews. These experts and institutions, working with the American Jewish Committee and other Israel advocacy groups, formulated a new “working definition” of antisemitism, including a list of examples, that was published in 2005 (and later discarded) by an EU body for combating racism. This working definition was adapted in 2016 by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA), and has been used, endorsed or recommended, with some small modifications, by a number of other organisations – including the US Department of State, which, since 2008, has defined antisemitism to include any of three categories of criticism of Israel, known as the “three Ds”: delegitimisation of Israel, demonisation of Israel and double standards for Israel. (More recently, the IHRA working definition has been at the centre of the antisemitism controversy in the Labour party, which adopted a modified version of the examples accompanying the definition.) By the state department’s definition, delegitimisation includes “Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, and denying Israel the right to exist”. Thus anti-Zionism – including the view that Israel should be a state of all its citizens, with equal rights for Jews and non-Jews – is a form of delegitimisation and therefore antisemitic. According to this definition, virtually all Palestinians (and a large proportion of ultra-Orthodox Jews in Israel, who oppose Zionism for religious reasons) are guilty of antisemitism because they want Jews and Palestinians to continue living in Palestine but not within a Jewish state. Kuperwasser, for one, stands by the charge: “Anti-Zionism and antisemitism are the same lady in a different cloak.” The second D, demonisation, includes “Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis” – as the Israeli army’s deputy chief of staff did during a Holocaust remembrance day speech in 2016, likening the “ revolting trends ” in Europe and Germany in the 1930s and 40s to tendencies visible in Israel today. The last of the three Ds, applying double standards, holds that singling Israel out for criticism is “the new antisemitism”. Yet practically every earlier divestment and boycott initiative around the world could be accused of double standards, including the campaign against apartheid South Africa, most of whose proponents ignored graver transgressions elsewhere, such as the concurrent genocides in Cambodia, Iraqi Kurdistan and East Timor. The new definition of antisemitism has been frequently deployed against Israel’s critics in the US, especially on university campuses. Israel advocacy groups have urged several universities to adopt the state department definition. At Northeastern University in Boston and the University of Toledo in Ohio, pro-Israel students and advocacy groups attempted to thwart even discussing boycott and divestment, arguing that it would create an antisemitic climate on campus. The California legislature passed a resolution in 2012 to regulate speech on California campuses; it cited examples of antisemitism that included not just delegitimisation and demonisation of Israel but also “student- and faculty-sponsored boycott, divestment and sanctions campaigns against Israel”. In 2015, an anonymous website, Canary Mission, began publishing lists of pro-Palestinian students who support divestment, often accusing them of antisemitism; the Israeli government has used Canary Mission profiles to interrogate and deny entry to pro-BDS US citizens. On several campuses, pro-Israel groups have intimidated pro-Palestinian students and faculty by placing names from the Canary Mission website on posters that state: “The following students and faculty … have allied themselves with Palestinian terrorists to perpetrate BDS and Jew Hatred on this campus.” Kuperwasser was unapologetic about the perceived excesses of Israel’s anti-BDS campaign at home and abroad. He was confident that Israel was taking the right approach and would succeed, as it had against past assaults: “We won the war on the conventional battlefield. To start with, our chances were very slim. We won the war on terror. Again, it wasn’t easy. I remember when we went to the big battle – the second intifada – and many generals around the world were telling me, ‘Listen, Kuper, you’re wasting your time: nobody ever won a war against terrorism,’ citing Vietnam and other cases. And I said: ‘No, we shall win this war as well. We are innovative and determined enough. And unlike many other battles, we don’t have a second option, an alternative. We have to win.’ The same goes here. We shall win.” F or Jewish Zionists in the diaspora, whether their support for Israel is critical or unwavering, the demands of the BDS movement are a non-starter. Most would say that it is tragic that 80% of the Palestinian residents within what would become the boundaries of Israel were forced into exile during the 1948 war, but the lesson of the Holocaust is that Jews must have their own state, full stop. They support the right of Palestinian refugees to return to the state of Palestine, not to Israel. This is among the primary reasons that they are so troubled by the prospect that there will never be a West Bank-Gaza state: few dispute that refugees have a right to return to their homeland – this is, after all, the founding idea of Zionism – but with no Palestinian state there is no good liberal answer to where Palestinians should return to. Because the BDS movement opposes a state with legally sanctioned discrimination against non-Jews and therefore rejects the idea of a Jewish state, many diaspora Jews view the threat it poses as existential. Thanks in no small part to the BDS movement, the Israel-Palestine debate is transforming from a question of how to end Israel’s occupation, which most liberal Jews do not support, to a referendum on the legitimacy of Israel, which they consider a settled fact that they shouldn’t have to defend. Beneath this principled opposition, there are also more visceral misgivings. One of the primary apprehensions of liberal Zionists about the BDS movement is what they consider to be its strident tone and uncompromising positions. Rabbi Jill Jacobs, the head of T’ruah, a rabbinic human rights organisation that works in both Israel and the US, said that she “straddles the line between progressive groups where Zionist is a bad word and pro-Israel groups where occupation is a bad word”. She said she felt alienated by the hostility of the BDS movement, which at times seemed to her downright gleeful as it publicised Israel’s misdeeds. “BDS is triggering 2,000 years of Jewish trauma and 70 years of post-Holocaust trauma,” she said. David Shulman, a renowned Indologist, Hebrew University professor, and activist with Ta’ayush (“co-existence”), a leftwing Israeli-Palestinian group that protects Palestinians from Israeli settler attacks, said that his biggest problem with BDS was “the virulent tonality” of it: “I understand it is a heterogeneous movement. But so much of it is based on hatred, which is a terrible basis for political action.” Many liberal Zionists recoil not just at the vehemence of some BDS activists, but also at their occasional conflation of Israel and the Jewish people, which they feel smacks of antisemitism. Simone Zimmerman, a co-founder of the American Jewish anti-occupation group IfNotNow, said she found the Israeli government no less guilty of the charge: “Bibi Netanyahu goes around the world saying, ‘I am here to represent the Jewish people, and the IDF is doing what it’s doing on behalf of all the Jewish people in the world.’ And the American Jewish Committee and Aipac say we’re doing what we’re doing to keep the Jews safe. I find it hard to make the case that our critics should be more nuanced than we are ourselves.” In the US and Europe, liberal Jews feel as alienated by the anti-Zionist BDS movement as by the illiberal supporters of Israeli policies they deplore. Last fall, the rightwing Zionist Organization of America feted Steve Bannon, the former Trump adviser whose ex-wife, in a sworn court declaration, recalled his complaint that their daughters’ school had too many Jews. Bannon had proclaimed himself a “Christian Zionist”. The “alt-right” leader Richard Spencer, an organiser of the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, at which white supremacists had chanted “Jews will not replace us”, had also declared himself a sort of Zionist, inspired by Israel’s example as an exclusionary ethnic state. Last year he said to an Israeli television interviewer: “You could say I’m a white Zionist in the sense that I care about my people. I want us to have a secure homeland for us and ourselves, just like you want a secure homeland in Israel.” The alliance between Israel’s allies and ultra-nationalists in Europe and the US has become a central theme of the BDS campaign’s messages. In this respect, the Trump era has been good for the movement. So has the Netanyahu government, whose attacks on BDS have been among the greatest drivers of publicity and recruitment for the campaign. Jacobs said that it had become harder and harder to be pro-Israel and anti-occupation in progressive spaces. “On the left, support for BDS is a litmus test: either you support it or you have no place.” To progressives, centre-left pro-Israel groups are increasingly viewed as Aipac-lite, supporting two states in name while in practice protecting Israel from any sort of pressure that might induce it to end a very comfortable occupation. Sharon Brous, a leading progressive rabbi in the US, told me, “I am not supportive of BDS, but I think we haven’t treated it correctly. Boycott is a tool that we in the Jewish community use often. It is nonviolent.” American progressives have advocated a number of domestic boycotts in recent years – including one against the state of North Carolina, over a controversial anti-LGBT law. Mouin Rabbani, a senior fellow with the Institute for Palestine Studies who is not active in the BDS movement, told me, “All these years we heard Israel and its supporters ask, ‘Where is the Palestinian Gandhi?’ And then when faced with a totally nonviolent Palestinian boycott campaign, they say they can’t support it.” Simone Zimmerman, the IfNotNow co-founder, said: “If you ask a random American Jew on the street, ‘Do you believe that people in their society shouldn’t discriminate based on ethnic heritage, and all people should have access to all the basic rights that you care about in America?’, they’d probably say yes. And then it comes to Israel, and they say: ‘Equality for all people? You’re trying to wipe Israel off the face of the map!’” I n Jaffa one Saturday afternoon, I met Kobi Snitz, a mathematician who works at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot and is a member of Boycott from Within, a group of pro-BDS Israelis, most of whom are Jews. Snitz is a veteran activist who has been participating in West Bank demonstrations with Palestinians since the second intifada. He has been arrested numerous times and spent many years protesting alongside the family of Ahed Tamimi, who has become a symbol of Palestinian unarmed resistance, following her arrest last December, at age 16, for slapping Israeli soldiers who entered her property shortly after the army shot her 15-year-old cousin in the head at close range. Kobi said that the protests he had joined in Tamimi’s village, Nabi Saleh, had dwindled over the years, as had non-violent resistance in the West Bank more generally. “It’s amazing that it lasted as long as it did,” he said. “Four died in Nabi Saleh, hundreds were injured, and roughly a third of the village was detained or jailed. For a village of 500 people to put up that kind of resistance on its own for that long is extraordinary. But, yes, eventually it dies down and dwindles. Oppression works. Terror works.” Snitz drove me, in a beat-up old sedan, to a lunch of Sudanese lentils in Neve Sha’anan, the poor south Tel Aviv neighbourhood that is home to many African asylum seekers. We were the only non-Africans in the restaurant or on the street. At bottom, he explained, boycott was a peaceful tactic of resisting immoral repression; the refusal to cooperate with gross injustice, he argued, was the minimum required of a person of conscience. As we drove back to Jaffa, passing a prison in which Snitz had been detained, he paraphrased words he had heard from the BDS co-founder, Omar Barghouti. “Omar said: ‘Look, I don’t want the west to come and save us. I’m not asking for the west to come invade Israel. I’m just asking it to stop supporting our oppression.’” Snitz added: “It’s true that this conflict is not special in how bad the violations are. What is special is how much the liberal west actively supports them.” • Follow the long read on Twitter at @gdnlongread , or sign up to the long read weekly email here ."
"Obama Seeks to Pave Way to Mideast Deal After He Leaves Office","Advertisement Supported by By  Mark Landler WASHINGTON — President Obama, resigned to his failure to broker a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians , is looking past his time in office and weighing a plan that would preserve at least the principle of a two-state solution for his successor to pursue. The White House is debating whether the president should lay down the outlines of an agreement, several officials said, perhaps through a resolution at the United Nations Security Council or in a presidential speech. The objective would not be to revive direct negotiations — almost nobody believes that is likely now — but to enshrine the proposals Secretary of State John Kerry made during his last failed effort at peacemaking in 2014. A Security Council resolution, officials said, would give enduring legitimacy to the compromises that Mr. Kerry hammered out in private between the two sides, and build broad international support for a series of proposed solutions that could provide the framework for a future Israeli-Palestinian agreement. These deliberations, which have been percolating for several months, have rattled Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and could lead to further tension between him and the president in a relationship that has already been marked by bitter rifts. Mr. Netanyahu on Monday declined an invitation to meet with Mr. Obama on March 18 in Washington, ostensibly because he did not want to get drawn into the volatile presidential election. In fact, several officials said, Mr. Netanyahu did not want to meet with Mr. Obama without having sealed the terms of a new pact on American military aid. The 10-year agreement, potentially worth more than $40 billion, is viewed as a way to compensate Israel for the Iran nuclear deal. But negotiations have run into snags, these people said, and Mr. Netanyahu did not want to risk leaving an Oval Office meeting empty-handed. An even deeper potential source of friction between the leaders, officials said, stems from the possibility that Mr. Obama will make a last foray into peacemaking. In whatever form that would take, the purpose would be to show a way of resolving all the central issues that divide the two sides, from the borders of a Palestinian state to Israel’s security and the political status of Jerusalem. “Obama and Kerry are looking at the very real likelihood that the two-state solution could die on their watch,” said Martin S. Indyk, who served as the special envoy for Israel-Palestinian peace negotiations under Mr. Kerry in 2013 and 2014. “Having tried everything else, I think they feel a responsibility, above all to Israel’s future as a Jewish and democratic state, to preserve the principles of a two-state solution.” After months of intensive talks, Mr. Kerry failed to break a deadlock on the so-called final-status issues between Mr. Netanyahu and the president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas. Mr. Netanyahu has since won re-election with a government that is even more hard-line on these issues than his last one. During that campaign, the prime minister disavowed his support for the two-state solution. Mr. Abbas’s position, meanwhile, has been eroded by months of violent attacks by Palestinians on Israeli Jews. Adding to the urgency of the debate, officials said, is a mounting American concern that a continued expansion of Jewish settlements in a swath of territory in the West Bank known as Area C will soon make a geographically and politically viable Palestinian state impossible. Middle East peace initiatives have long had appeal for late-term presidents. Ronald Reagan opened a dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organization during his final months in office. Bill Clinton and George W. Bush both made last-ditch attempts to broker peace deals in their last years in office. Any new effort by Mr. Obama would bear a host of uncertain political ramifications in an election year. While the Democratic front-runner, Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state, has declared that she would pursue a peace accord as president, she might not welcome having to take a position on a Security Council resolution that is viewed as putting pressure on Israel. Republicans could seize on a diplomatic overture to throw their support behind Israel, though the party’s current front-runner, Donald J. Trump, has pledged to take a neutral stance in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Yet all these qualms, officials said, could take a back seat to Mr. Obama’s frustration about his failure in the peace process and its impact on his legacy, particularly as a president who once made an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement a centerpiece of his diplomacy. “There will be a great temptation to do something in the final year,” said Aaron David Miller, a vice president at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. “For a president who came out faster and more aggressively on the Middle East than any of his predecessors, there is a gnawing sense of incompletion and perhaps even failure.” Among the questions the White House is considering is how long to wait. Deferring action until after the November election would ease the political pressure on the Democratic nominee. But it would shorten the time to build international support for a resolution. In Jerusalem, Israeli officials refused to comment on any possible moves by Mr. Obama. But they reiterated their long-held position that the only way to reach any agreement with the Palestinians was through bilateral negotiations, not international organizations. Ehud Yaari, a prominent Israeli analyst at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said Mr. Netanyahu was probably less concerned about the possible publication of parameters by the administration or a Security Council resolution than about what, if any, mechanism would be proposed for propelling the peace process forward. “It would be one more U.N.S.C. resolution,” Mr. Yaari said, adding that the wording would “not necessarily be negative” for Israel. Washington’s policies are well known, he said, adding, “Obama is not going to produce something dramatically different,” he said. “The question is what mechanism is to be introduced. That is the major issue.” Mr. Indyk agreed that a Security Council resolution need not be punitive for Israel. It would most likely be modeled on a United Nations resolution adopted after the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, which called for Israeli forces to withdraw from occupied territories and for the establishment of a lasting peace. The latest contretemps between Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Obama showed how little trust they have for each other. After articles appeared in the Israeli news media that the president had not offered the prime minister a date for a meeting, the White House issued a statement that pointedly rebuffed that claim. Hours later, Mr. Netanyahu’s office issued a statement in which it said the whole thing was a misunderstanding. The prime minister, the statement said, was looking forward to a visit Wednesday by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. “and discussing how we can meet the many challenges facing the region.” While the negotiations over the military aid package were complex, American officials expressed confidence they would be resolved soon. Next week, Israel’s defense minister, Moshe Yaalon, is scheduled to meet Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter at the Pentagon. “We’re in the kind of final stages of talking,” said the deputy defense secretary, Bob Work.

"Iran’s Role in the Syrian Crisis","Advertisement Supported by Editorial By  The Editorial Board The decision to include Iran in international talks on Syria’s future means that all the major foreign players will sit together for the first time to consider a political resolution of the war, which has killed more than 250,000 people and caused millions more to flee the country. Iran’s presence in Vienna on Thursday and Friday won’t guarantee an end to Syria’s prolonged agony, but it improves the chances that a solution can be found. Russia, the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates are also expected to attend. The United States, Russia and Europe failed at earlier efforts to reach a negotiated end to Syria’s civil war, which has raged since 2011, and created such chaos that the murderous Islamic State has been able to seize vast swaths of territory. There are many reasons for that failure, chiefly Russia’s obstinacy, but one is the refusal to include Iran, which with Moscow provides vital support for President Bashar al-Assad of Syria. Initially, the exclusion made sense. The United States, which does not have formal diplomatic relations with Iran, was mainly preoccupied — as were other major Western powers — with reaching an agreement with Iran on nuclear weapons. With that deal done, there is every reason to engage Iran on Syria, especially since Russia’s recent military intervention on the side of Mr. Assad has vastly complicated the conflict and added new urgency to the need for a political solution. Not everyone will be happy to see Iran at the table. Saudi Arabia, deeply suspicious of Iran’s regional ambitions, argues that negotiating with Iran only legitimizes a government that is exerting malign influence in Iraq, Lebanon, Yemen, Bahrain and Syria. The Saudis, who are Sunnis, fought especially hard to keep Shiite Iran, its main regional rival, from the Vienna meeting and it took a trip to Riyadh on Saturday by Secretary of State John Kerry and a phone call on Tuesday by President Obama to Saudi King Salman to win them over. The Saudis want Mr. Assad removed from power and the Iranians removed from any post-Assad Syria. They have reportedly tried to enlist President Vladimir Putin of Russia in these objectives with offers of assistance for Russia’s battered economy. Mr. Putin reportedly told the Saudis that he agreed that Iran’s role in Syria is too big, but that he could not guarantee Mr. Assad’s removal. The Saudis aside, most of the negotiators in Vienna would be delighted by progress on a framework for a transition from Mr. Assad to a more inclusive government. While Mr. Assad needs to leave, the change must be done carefully, retaining the institutions that help keep the state intact. Ideally, a political solution would lead to a more unified multinational campaign against the Islamic State and an eventual end to all foreign involvement in Syria. In an interview in December 2013, Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said that Iran understood that there could be no military solution in Syria and would not stand in the way of a political solution. Since then however, Iran has doubled down on its military involvement in Syria, while its supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has said that there will be no cooperation with the United States on issues other than the nuclear agreement. Given the mixed messages, no one knows yet what Iran will do, but it has a chance to make a difference in Syria. Its involvement in Vienna will be a test of whether it intends to play a constructive role in the region and in ending Mr. Assad’s brutal war. Advertisement"
"With a week to go in nuclear talks, Iran wants focus on sanctions relief","Iranian negotiators want sanctions to be lifted at the same time as the country dismantles nuclear hardware. The US insists the sequence was agreed three months ago. Julian Borger Vienna  Wed 1 Jul 2015 09.50 BST   Last modified on Fri 14 Jul 2017 21.57 BST   Yet again, the negotiators at the Iran nuclear talks have given themselves another deadline to conclude an agreement, but this one is different. Previous target dates have been self-imposed. The new one, July 7, has been forced on the diplomats by external actors hostile to an agreement. Congress has demanded to see a copy of the agreement by July 9, or it will take two months instead of just one to review it. Every extra day the agreement remains in limbo will be a day when its enemies in Washington, Tehran and Israel will be able to rally against it. So to be sure any agreement is delivered on time to Congress with the correct accompanying documentation, the foreign ministers in Vienna have given themselves a deadline two days earlier. In fact they are likely to aim to get done by the end of the weekend, to provide a margin of error. Diplomats from Iran and the six major powers at the talks (the P5+1) are talking as if this doable. There has been such dramatic progress, with so many previously intractable issues being resolved, that the idea of stumbling now has become almost unthinkable, notwithstanding the predictable tough rhetoric on all sides. At the start of this week of extra time, one of the lead Iranian negotiators, the Iranian deputy foreign minister, Majid Ravanchi, gave an unusually detailed interview to Ariane Tabatabai, a Georgetown academic, for the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, laying out the state of play as Tehran sees it. One of the points to come out of the interview is that the issue of inspections of Iranian sites does not seem to be a problem any more. Ravanchi pointed out that Iran will pass into law the Additional Protocol (AP) of its agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency. That allows for military inspections on a managed basis, but he stressed that did not imply a free-for-all for western inspectors to drop in any time on military bases. The AP is about providing access to certain areas where there is proof that there have been some alleged wrongdoings, the documents of which should be given to the members. I don’t think there will be any problem in the future on the implementation of the AP. It is striking how much the language on this issue echoes that of western diplomats. Inspections will be carried out under the AP. Access will be given to military sites when there are demonstrable grounds for suspicion. A mechanism will be developed under the agreement to resolve disputes. In principle, the IAEA will be allowed to go where it thinks it needs to go, but timing can be negotiated. The thinking is that non-nuclear military secrets can be moved around and hidden if the military is given a bit of notice, but nuclear infrastructure is usually far harder to hide. The more substantive issue to come out of the Ravanchi interview is the centrality for the Iranians on the question of sanctions. Much of the time since a framework was agreed in Lausanne in April has been taken up adding language to the text to ensure that Iranian undertakings to reduce and convert its nuclear programme are made watertight, partly with an eye to the very critical scrutiny the deal will get in Congress. The Iranians now want more time spent spelling out what Iran will get in terms of sanctions relief in greater detail, so as to be sure of what it will receive. This is how Ravanchi put it: One other point I should emphasise here is that in Lausanne we went into a lot of detail on the nuclear side. We also discussed sanctions, but compared to what we achieved on the nuclear issue, we didn’t get as far. So, this is now of paramount importance. And as I said, if we are going further into detail on the nuclear issue, we need to also do the same on the sanctions issue. Some of the detail on sanctions relief involves questions over what will happen to sanctions imposed on Iranian banks or other entities by US states and cities, and what happens to banks or companies which are blacklisted under both nuclear-related and humans rights sanctions. The question is whether the Iranian side’s demands are simply about clarity or whether it wants to change the Lausanne framework. The Lausanne ‘parameters’ as published by the US state department say that Iran gets sanctions relief after it has taken concrete steps to reduce its nuclear programme: dismantling centrifuges, getting rid of the low enriched uranium stockpile and taking the core out of the Arak heavy water reactor. This is the American version. US and EU nuclear-related sanctions will be suspended after the IAEA has verified that Iran has taken all of its key nuclear-related steps. If at any time Iran fails to fulfill its commitments, these sanctions will snap back into place. This is what Ravanchi said: [W]e can’t be expected to do our job, meet our obligation, and then wait for the other side to meet theirs. So there needs to be some proportionality here, and we have told our P5+1 partners that Iran is ready to take a number of steps on the nuclear issue.. at the first stage, provided we get the assurance that the other side.. do their end. We are still talking about all this. But this issue [is] of simultaneity—that Iran will have to do its share, and simultaneously they have to do their share. But it can’t be based on a principle of the other side waiting until we are done and then deciding what needs to be done. So this issue of simultaneity is something we’ve insisted upon, and I think our colleagues have understood this. The US and its allies understand it, but they do not necessarily agree. Hence the repeated reminders from US officials in Vienna and from President Obama on Tuesday that Iran has to stick to the Lausanne principles. Earlier this week, a senior US official suggested that preparations for sanctions relief would be underway while Iran took its steps and that would count as simultaneity. We have a lot of preparation to do. It is not something you just turn a switch and all of a sudden it’s gone. There’s not only paperwork but a lot of interaction with financial institutions, developing regulatory guidelines, guidance to banks – tons and tons of stuff. We have to prepare as well. So everybody will get ready, everybody will take their steps, and then when the IAEA has verified virtually simultaneously whatever commitments we make about the first phase of the lifting of sanctions will occur. This is unlikely to be enough for the Iranians, who are now constrained by the public remarks by the Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei on the issue. Tehran wants something tangible while it is taking centrifuges apart and yanking the reactor core from Arak. One option is the $100 billion in Iranian assets currently frozen around the world. The government in Tehran has already earmarked all of it for digging itself out of the mountain of internal debt to the banks and construction sector build up by former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Eliminating that debt is key to getting the country going again. Whether it is that money that will be key to getting around this stumbling block in the last days, or something else, Ravanchi sounded confident it would happen. “I think this can be solved,” he said."
"Transcript: Trump’s First State of the Union Speech, Annotated","Advertisement  JAN. 30, 2018   New York Times reporters analyze the 45th president’s prepared remarks, as released by the White House.  Related Article  Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and my fellow Americans: Less than one year has passed since I first stood at this podium, in this majestic chamber, to speak on behalf of the American People – and to address their concerns, their hopes, and their dreams.  That night, our new Administration had already taken swift action.  A new tide of optimism was already sweeping across our land. Each day since, we have gone forward with a clear vision and a righteous mission – to make America great again for all Americans. Over the last year, we have made incredible progress and achieved extraordinary success. We have faced challenges we expected, and others we could never have imagined.  We have shared in the heights of victory and the pains of hardship.  We endured floods and fires and storms.  But through it all, we have seen the beauty of America’s soul, and the steel in America’s spine. Nicholas Fandos, Congressional Correspondent Each test has forged new American heroes to remind us who we are, and show us what we can be. We saw the volunteers of the “Cajun Navy,” racing to the rescue with their fishing boats to save people in the aftermath of a devastating hurricane. We saw strangers shielding strangers from a hail of gunfire on the Las Vegas strip. We heard tales of Americans like Coast Guard Petty Officer Ashlee Leppert, who is here tonight in the gallery with Melania.  Ashlee was aboard one of the first helicopters on the scene in Houston during Hurricane Harvey.  Through 18 hours of wind and rain, Ashlee braved live power lines and deep water, to help save more than 40 lives.  Thank you, Ashlee. We heard about Americans like firefighter David Dahlberg.  He is here with us too.  David faced down walls of flame to rescue almost 60 children trapped at a California summer camp threatened by wildfires. Thomas Kaplan, Congressional Correspondent Some trials over the past year touched this chamber very personally.  With us tonight is one of the toughest people ever to serve in this House – a guy who took a bullet, almost died, and was back to work three and a half months later:  the legend from Louisiana, Congressman Steve Scalise. We are incredibly grateful for the heroic efforts of the Capitol Police Officers, the Alexandria Police, and the doctors, nurses, and paramedics who saved his life, and the lives of many others in this room. In the aftermath of that terrible shooting, we came together, not as Republicans or Democrats, but as representatives of the people. But it is not enough to come together only in times of tragedy.  Tonight, I call upon all of us to set aside our differences, to seek out common ground, and to summon the unity we need to deliver for the people we were elected to serve. Nicholas Fandos, Congressional Correspondent Over the last year, the world has seen what we always knew:  that no people on Earth are so fearless, or daring, or determined as Americans.  If there is a mountain, we climb it.  If there is a frontier, we cross it.  If there is a challenge, we tame it.  If there is an opportunity, we seize it. So let us begin tonight by recognizing that the state of our Union is strong because our people are strong. And together, we are building a safe, strong, and proud America. Since the election, we have created 2.4 million new jobs, including 200,000 new jobs in manufacturing alone. After years of wage stagnation, we are finally seeing rising wages. Jim Tankersley, Economics and Tax Reporter Unemployment claims have hit a 45-year low.  African-American unemployment stands at the lowest rate ever recorded, and Hispanic American unemployment has also reached the lowest levels in history. Small business confidence is at an all-time high.  The stock market has smashed one record after another, gaining $8 trillion in value.  That is great news for Americans’ 401k, retirement, pension, and college savings accounts. Thomas Kaplan, Congressional Correspondent Our massive tax cuts provide tremendous relief for the middle class and small businesses. To lower tax rates for hardworking Americans, we nearly doubled the standard deduction for everyone.  Now, the first $24,000 earned by a married couple is completely tax-free.  We also doubled the child tax credit. A typical family of four making $75,000 will see their tax bill reduced by $2,000 – slashing their tax bill in half. This April will be the last time you ever file under the old broken system – and millions of Americans will have more take-home pay starting next month. We eliminated an especially cruel tax that fell mostly on Americans making less than $50,000 a year – forcing them to pay tremendous penalties simply because they could not afford government-ordered health plans. We repealed the core of disastrous Obamacare – the individual mandate is now gone. Thomas Kaplan, Congressional Correspondent We slashed the business tax rate from 35 percent all the way down to 21 percent, so American companies can compete and win against anyone in the world.  These changes alone are estimated to increase average family income by more than $4,000. Small businesses have also received a massive tax cut, and can now deduct 20 percent of their business income. Here tonight are Steve Staub and Sandy Keplinger of Staub Manufacturing – a small business in Ohio.  They have just finished the best year in their 20-year history.  Because of tax reform, they are handing out raises, hiring an additional 14 people, and expanding into the building next door. One of Staub’s employees, Corey Adams, is also with us tonight.  Corey is an all-American worker.  He supported himself through high school, lost his job during the 2008 recession, and was later hired by Staub, where he trained to become a welder.  Like many hardworking Americans, Corey plans to invest his tax‑cut raise into his new home and his two daughters’ education.  Please join me in congratulating Corey. Since we passed tax cuts, roughly 3 million workers have already gotten tax cut bonuses – many of them thousands of dollars per worker. Apple has just announced it plans to invest a total of $350 billion in America, and hire another 20,000 workers. This is our new American moment.  There has never been a better time to start living the American Dream. So to every citizen watching at home tonight – no matter where you have been, or where you come from, this is your time.  If you work hard, if you believe in yourself, if you believe in America, then you can dream anything, you can be anything, and together, we can achieve anything. Tonight, I want to talk about what kind of future we are going to have, and what kind of Nation we are going to be.  All of us, together, as one team, one people, and one American family. We all share the same home, the same heart, the same destiny, and the same great American flag. Together, we are rediscovering the American way. In America, we know that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the center of the American life.  Our motto is “in God we trust.” And we celebrate our police, our military, and our amazing veterans as heroes who deserve our total and unwavering support. Here tonight is Preston Sharp, a 12-year-old boy from Redding, California, who noticed that veterans’ graves were not marked with flags on Veterans Day.  He decided to change that, and started a movement that has now placed 40,000 flags at the graves of our great heroes.  Preston:  a job well done. Young patriots like Preston teach all of us about our civic duty as Americans.  Preston’s reverence for those who have served our Nation reminds us why we salute our flag, why we put our hands on our hearts for the pledge of allegiance, and why we proudly stand for the national anthem . Nicholas Fandos, Congressional Correspondent Americans love their country.  And they deserve a Government that shows them the same love and loyalty in return. For the last year we have sought to restore the bonds of trust between our citizens and their Government. Working with the Senate, we are appointing judges who will interpret the Constitution as written, including a great new Supreme Court Justice, and more circuit court judges than any new administration in the history of our country. Alan Rappeport, Economic Policy Reporter We are defending our Second Amendment, and have taken historic actions to protect religious liberty. And we are serving our brave veterans, including giving our veterans choice in their healthcare decisions.  Last year, the Congress passed, and I signed, the landmark VA Accountability Act.  Since its passage, my Administration has already removed more than 1,500 VA employees who failed to give our veterans the care they deserve – and we are hiring talented people who love our vets as much as we do. I will not stop until our veterans are properly taken care of, which has been my promise to them from the very beginning of this great journey. All Americans deserve accountability and respect – and that is what we are giving them.  So tonight, I call on the Congress to empower every Cabinet Secretary with the authority to reward good workers – and to remove Federal employees who undermine the public trust or fail the American people. In our drive to make Washington accountable, we have eliminated more regulations in our first year than any administration in history. Jonathan Martin, National Political Correspondent Coral Davenport, Climate Change Reporter Coral Davenport, Climate Change Reporter Many car companies are now building and expanding plants in the United States – something we have not seen for decades.    Chrysler is moving a major plant from Mexico to Michigan; Toyota and Mazda are opening up a plant in Alabama.  Soon, plants will be opening up all over the country.  This is all news Americans are unaccustomed to hearing – for many years, companies and jobs were only leaving us.  But now they are coming back. Exciting progress is happening every day. To speed access to breakthrough cures and affordable generic drugs, last year the FDA approved more new and generic drugs and medical devices than ever before in our history. We also believe that patients with terminal conditions should have access to experimental treatments that could potentially save their lives. People who are terminally ill should not have to go from country to country to seek a cure – I want to give them a chance right here at home.  It is time for the Congress to give these wonderful Americans the “right to try.” One of my greatest priorities is to reduce the price of prescription drugs.  In many other countries, these drugs cost far less than what we pay in the United States.  That is why I have directed my Administration to make fixing the injustice of high drug prices one of our top priorities.  Prices will come down. America has also finally turned the page on decades of unfair trade deals that sacrificed our prosperity and shipped away our companies, our jobs, and our Nation’s wealth. The era of economic surrender is over. From now on, we expect trading relationships to be fair and to be reciprocal. Alan Rappeport, Economic Policy Reporter And we will protect American workers and American intellectual property, through strong enforcement of our trade rules. As we rebuild our industries, it is also time to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. America is a nation of builders.  We built the Empire State Building in just one year – is it not a disgrace that it can now take 10 years just to get a permit approved for a simple road? I am asking both parties to come together to give us the safe, fast, reliable, and modern infrastructure our economy needs and our people deserve. Thomas Kaplan, Congressional Correspondent Every Federal dollar should be leveraged by partnering with State and local governments and, where appropriate, tapping into private sector investment – to permanently fix the infrastructure deficit. Any bill must also streamline the permitting and approval process – getting it down to no more than two years, and perhaps even one. Together, we can reclaim our building heritage.  We will build gleaming new roads, bridges, highways, railways, and waterways across our land.  And we will do it with American heart, American hands, and American grit. We want every American to know the dignity of a hard day’s work.  We want every child to be safe in their home at night.  And we want every citizen to be proud of this land that we love. We can lift our citizens from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity. As tax cuts create new jobs, let us invest in workforce development and job training.  Let us open great vocational schools so our future workers can learn a craft and realize their full potential.  And let us support working families by supporting paid family leave. As America regains its strength, this opportunity must be extended to all citizens.  That is why this year we will embark on reforming our prisons to help former inmates who have served their time get a second chance. Struggling communities, especially immigrant communities, will also be helped by immigration policies that focus on the best interests of American workers and American families. For decades, open borders have allowed drugs and gangs to pour into our most vulnerable communities.  They have allowed millions of low-wage workers to compete for jobs and wages against the poorest Americans.  Most tragically, they have caused the loss of many innocent lives. Here tonight are two fathers and two mothers:  Evelyn Rodriguez, Freddy Cuevas, Elizabeth Alvarado, and Robert Mickens. Their two teenage daughters – Kayla Cuevas and Nisa Mickens – were close friends on Long Island.  But in September 2016, on the eve of Nisa’s 16th Birthday, neither of them came home.  These two precious girls were brutally murdered while walking together in their hometown.  Six members of the savage gang MS-13 have been charged with Kayla and Nisa’s murders.  Many of these gang members took advantage of glaring loopholes in our laws to enter the country as unaccompanied alien minors ‑- and wound up in Kayla and Nisa’s high school. Nicholas Fandos, Congressional Correspondent Evelyn, Elizabeth, Freddy, and Robert:  Tonight, everyone in this chamber is praying for you.  Everyone in America is grieving for you.  And 320 million hearts are breaking for you.  We cannot imagine the depth of your sorrow, but we can make sure that other families never have to endure this pain. Tonight, I am calling on the Congress to finally close the deadly loopholes that have allowed MS-13, and other criminals, to break into our country. We have proposed new legislation that will fix our immigration laws, and support our ICE and Border Patrol Agents, so that this cannot ever happen again. Helene Cooper, Pentagon Correspondent The United States is a compassionate nation.  We are proud that we do more than any other country to help the needy, the struggling, and the underprivileged all over the world.  But as President of the United States, my highest loyalty, my greatest compassion, and my constant concern is for America’s children, America’s struggling workers, and America’s forgotten communities.  I want our youth to grow up to achieve great things.  I want our poor to have their chance to rise. So tonight, I am extending an open hand to work with members of both parties – Democrats and Republicans – to protect our citizens of every background, color, religion, and creed.  My duty, and the sacred duty of every elected official in this chamber, is to defend Americans – to protect their safety, their families, their communities, and their right to the American Dream.  Because Americans are dreamers too. Here tonight is one leader in the effort to defend our country: Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Celestino Martinez – he goes by CJ.  CJ served 15 years in the Air Force before becoming an ICE agent and spending the last 15 years fighting gang violence and getting dangerous criminals off our streets.  At one point, MS-13 leaders ordered CJ’s murder.  But he did not cave to threats or fear.  Last May, he commanded an operation to track down gang members on Long Island.  His team has arrested nearly 400, including more than 220 from MS-13. Amy Fiscus, National Security Editor CJ, great work.  Now let us get the Congress to send you some reinforcements. Over the next few weeks, the House and Senate will be voting on an immigration reform package. In recent months, my Administration has met extensively with both Democrats and Republicans to craft a bipartisan approach to immigration reform.  Based on these discussions, we presented the Congress with a detailed proposal that should be supported by both parties as a fair compromise – one where nobody gets everything they want, but where our country gets the critical reforms it needs. Here are the four pillars of our plan: The first pillar of our framework generously offers a path to citizenship for 1.8 million illegal immigrants who were brought here by their parents at a young age – that covers almost three times more people than the previous administration.  Under our plan, those who meet education and work requirements, and show good moral character, will be able to become full citizens of the United States. The second pillar fully secures the border .  That means building a wall on the Southern border, and it means hiring more heroes like CJ to keep our communities safe.  Crucially, our plan closes the terrible loopholes exploited by criminals and terrorists to enter our country – and it finally ends the dangerous practice of “catch and release.” Amy Fiscus, National Security Editor The third pillar ends the visa lottery – a program that randomly hands out green cards without any regard for skill, merit, or the safety of our people.  It is time to begin moving towards a merit-based immigration system – one that admits people who are skilled, who want to work, who will contribute to our society, and who will love and respect our country. Sheryl Gay Stolberg, Congressional Correspondent The fourth and final pillar protects the nuclear family by ending chain migration .  Under the current broken system, a single immigrant can bring in virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives.  Under our plan, we focus on the immediate family by limiting sponsorships to spouses and minor children.  This vital reform is necessary, not just for our economy, but for our security, and our future. Linda Qiu, Fact Check Reporter In recent weeks, two terrorist attacks in New York were made possible by the visa lottery and chain migration.  In the age of terrorism, these programs present risks we can no longer afford. It is time to reform these outdated immigration rules, and finally bring our immigration system into the 21st century. Thomas Kaplan, Congressional Correspondent For over 30 years, Washington has tried and failed to solve this problem.  This Congress can be the one that finally makes it happen. Most importantly, these four pillars will produce legislation that fulfills my ironclad pledge to only sign a bill that puts America first.  So let us come together, set politics aside, and finally get the job done. These reforms will also support our response to the terrible crisis of opioid and drug addiction. In 2016, we lost 64,000 Americans to drug overdoses:  174 deaths per day.  Seven per hour.  We must get much tougher on drug dealers and pushers if we are going to succeed in stopping this scourge. Thomas Kaplan, Congressional Correspondent As we have seen tonight, the most difficult challenges bring out the best in America. We see a vivid expression of this truth in the story of the Holets family of New Mexico.  Ryan Holets is 27 years old, and an officer with the Albuquerque Police Department.  He is here tonight with his wife Rebecca.  Last year, Ryan was on duty when he saw a pregnant, homeless woman preparing to inject heroin.  When Ryan told her she was going to harm her unborn child, she began to weep.  She told him she did not know where to turn, but badly wanted a safe home for her baby. In that moment, Ryan said he felt God speak to him:  “You will do it – because you can.”  He took out a picture of his wife and their four kids.  Then, he went home to tell his wife Rebecca.  In an instant, she agreed to adopt.  The Holets named their new daughter Hope. Ryan and Rebecca:  You embody the goodness of our Nation.  Thank you, and congratulations. As we rebuild America’s strength and confidence at home, we are also restoring our strength and standing abroad. Around the world, we face rogue regimes, terrorist groups, and rivals like China and Russia that challenge our interests, our economy, and our values.  In confronting these dangers, we know that weakness is the surest path to conflict, and unmatched power is the surest means of our defense. Thomas Kaplan, Congressional Correspondent As part of our defense, we must modernize and rebuild our nuclear arsenal, hopefully never having to use it, but making it so strong and powerful that it will deter any acts of aggression.  Perhaps someday in the future there will be a magical moment when the countries of the world will get together to eliminate their nuclear weapons.  Unfortunately, we are not there yet. Last year, I also pledged that we would work with our allies to extinguish ISIS from the face of the Earth. One year later, I am proud to report that the coalition to defeat ISIS has liberated almost 100 percent of the territory once held by these killers in Iraq and Syria. But there is much more work to be done.  We will continue our fight until ISIS is defeated. Helene Cooper, Pentagon Correspondent Army Staff Sergeant Justin Peck is here tonight.  Near Raqqa last November, Justin and his comrade, Chief Petty Officer Kenton Stacy, were on a mission to clear buildings that ISIS had rigged with explosives so that civilians could return to the city. Clearing the second floor of a vital hospital, Kenton Stacy was severely wounded by an explosion.  Immediately, Justin bounded into the booby-trapped building and found Kenton in bad shape.  He applied pressure to the wound and inserted a tube to reopen an airway.  He then performed CPR for 20 straight minutes during the ground transport and maintained artificial respiration through 2 hours of emergency surgery. Kenton Stacy would have died if not for Justin’s selfless love for a fellow warrior.  Tonight, Kenton is recovering in Texas.  Raqqa is liberated.  And Justin is wearing his new Bronze Star, with a “V” for “Valor.”  Staff Sergeant Peck:  All of America salutes you. Terrorists who do things like place bombs in civilian hospitals are evil.  When possible, we annihilate them.  When necessary, we must be able to detain and question them.  But we must be clear:  Terrorists are not merely criminals.  They are unlawful enemy combatants.  And when captured overseas, they should be treated like the terrorists they are. In the past, we have foolishly released hundreds of dangerous terrorists, only to meet them again on the battlefield – including the ISIS leader, al-Baghdadi. So today, I am keeping another promise. I just signed an order directing Secretary Mattis to reexamine our military detention policy and to keep open the detention facilities at Guantánamo Bay. Nicholas Fandos, Congressional Correspondent I am also asking the Congress to ensure that, in the fight against ISIS and Al Qaeda, we continue to have all necessary power to detain terrorists – wherever we chase them down. Our warriors in Afghanistan also have new rules of engagement.  Along with their heroic Afghan partners, our military is no longer undermined by artificial timelines, and we no longer tell our enemies our plans. Last month, I also took an action endorsed unanimously by the Senate just months before:  I recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Shortly afterwards, dozens of countries voted in the United Nations General Assembly against America’s sovereign right to make this recognition.  American taxpayers generously send those same countries billions of dollars in aid every year. That is why, tonight, I am asking the Congress to pass legislation to help ensure American foreign-assistance dollars always serve American interests, and only go to America’s friends. Nicholas Fandos, Congressional Correspondent When the people of Iran rose up against the crimes of their corrupt dictatorship, I did not stay silent.  America stands with the people of Iran in their courageous struggle for freedom. Nicholas Fandos, Congressional Correspondent My Administration has also imposed tough sanctions on the communist and socialist dictatorships in Cuba and Venezuela. But no regime has oppressed its own citizens more totally or brutally than the cruel dictatorship in North Korea. North Korea’s reckless pursuit of nuclear missiles could very soon threaten our homeland. We are waging a campaign of maximum pressure to prevent that from happening. Past experience has taught us that complacency and concessions only invite aggression and provocation.  I will not repeat the mistakes of past administrations that got us into this dangerous position. We need only look at the depraved character of the North Korean regime to understand the nature of the nuclear threat it could pose to America and our allies. Otto Warmbier was a hardworking student at the University of Virginia.  On his way to study abroad in Asia, Otto joined a tour to North Korea.  At its conclusion, this wonderful young man was arrested and charged with crimes against the state.  After a shameful trial, the dictatorship sentenced Otto to 15 years of hard labor, before returning him to America last June – horribly injured and on the verge of death.  He passed away just days after his return. Sheryl Gay Stolberg, Congressional Correspondent Otto’s Parents, Fred and Cindy Warmbier, are with us tonight – along with Otto’s brother and sister, Austin and Greta.  You are powerful witnesses to a menace that threatens our world, and your strength inspires us all.  Tonight, we pledge to honor Otto’s memory with American resolve. Finally, we are joined by one more witness to the ominous nature of this regime.  His name is Mr. Ji Seong-ho. In 1996, Seong-ho was a starving boy in North Korea.  One day, he tried to steal coal from a railroad car to barter for a few scraps of food.  In the process, he passed out on the train tracks, exhausted from hunger.  He woke up as a train ran over his limbs.  He then endured multiple amputations without anything to dull the pain.  His brother and sister gave what little food they had to help him recover and ate dirt themselves – permanently stunting their own growth.  Later, he was tortured by North Korean authorities after returning from a brief visit to China.  His tormentors wanted to know if he had met any Christians.  He had – and he resolved to be free. Seong-ho traveled thousands of miles on crutches across China and Southeast Asia to freedom.  Most of his family followed.  His father was caught trying to escape, and was tortured to death. Today he lives in Seoul, where he rescues other defectors, and broadcasts into North Korea what the regime fears the most ‑- the truth. Today he has a new leg, but Seong-ho, I understand you still keep those crutches as a reminder of how far you have come.  Your great sacrifice is an inspiration to us all. Seong-ho’s story is a testament to the yearning of every human soul to live in freedom. It was that same yearning for freedom that nearly 250 years ago gave birth to a special place called America.  It was a small cluster of colonies caught between a great ocean and a vast wilderness.  But it was home to an incredible people with a revolutionary idea:  that they could rule themselves.  That they could chart their own destiny.  And that, together, they could light up the world. That is what our country has always been about. That is what Americans have always stood for, always strived for, and always done. Thomas Kaplan, Congressional Correspondent Atop the dome of this Capitol stands the Statue of Freedom.  She stands tall and dignified among the monuments to our ancestors who fought and lived and died to protect her. Monuments to Washington and Jefferson – to Lincoln and King. Memorials to the heroes of Yorktown and Saratoga – to young Americans who shed their blood on the shores of Normandy, and the fields beyond.  And others, who went down in the waters of the Pacific and the skies over Asia. And freedom stands tall over one more monument:  this one.  This Capitol.  This living monument to the American people. A people whose heroes live not only in the past, but all around us – defending hope, pride, and the American way. They work in every trade.  They sacrifice to raise a family.  They care for our children at home.  They defend our flag abroad.  They are strong moms and brave kids.  They are firefighters, police officers, border agents, medics, and Marines. But above all else, they are Americans.  And this Capitol, this city, and this Nation, belong to them. Our task is to respect them, to listen to them, to serve them, to protect them, and to always be worthy of them. Americans fill the world with art and music.  They push the bounds of science and discovery.  And they forever remind us of what we should never forget:  The people dreamed this country. The people built this country.  And it is the people who are making America great again. As long as we are proud of who we are, and what we are fighting for, there is nothing we cannot achieve. As long as we have confidence in our values, faith in our citizens, and trust in our God, we will not fail. Our families will thrive. Our people will prosper. And our Nation will forever be safe and strong and proud and mighty and free. Michael S. Schmidt, National Security Correspondent Advertisement"
"The full speech – Trump's State of the Union address","The president gave his first State of the Union address at the Capitol in Washington DC on Tuesday night  Wed 31 Jan 2018 03.38 GMT   Last modified on Fri 9 Feb 2018 18.34 GMT   Mr Speaker, Mr vice-president, members of Congress, the first lady of the United States and my fellow Americans: Less than one year has passed since I first stood at this podium, in this majestic chamber, to speak on behalf of the American People – and to address their concerns, their hopes and their dreams. That night, our new administration had already taken swift action. A new tide of optimism was already sweeping across our land. Each day since, we have gone forward with a clear vision and a righteous mission – to make America great again for all Americans. Over the last year, we have made incredible progress and achieved extraordinary success. We have faced challenges we expected, and others we could never have imagined. We have shared in the heights of victory and the pains of hardship. We endured floods and fires and storms. But through it all, we have seen the beauty of America’s soul, and the steel in America’s spine. Each test has forged new American heroes to remind us who we are, and show us what we can be. We saw the volunteers of the “Cajun Navy”, racing to the rescue with their fishing boats to save people in the aftermath of a devastating hurricane. We saw strangers shielding strangers from a hail of gunfire on the Las Vegas strip. We heard tales of Americans like Coast Guard Petty Officer Ashlee Leppert, who is here tonight in the gallery with Melania. Ashlee was aboard one of the first helicopters on the scene in Houston during Hurricane Harvey. Through 18 hours of wind and rain, Ashlee braved live power lines and deep water, to help save more than 40 lives. Thank you, Ashlee. We heard about Americans like firefighter David Dahlberg. He is here with us too. David faced down walls of flame to rescue almost 60 children trapped at a California summer camp threatened by wildfires. To everyone still recovering in Texas, Florida, Louisiana, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, California and everywhere else – we are with you, we love you, and we will pull through together. Some trials over the past year touched this chamber very personally. With us tonight is one of the toughest people ever to serve in this House – a guy who took a bullet, almost died, and was back to work three and a half months later: the legend from Louisiana, Congressman Steve Scalise. We are incredibly grateful for the heroic efforts of the Capitol police officers, the Alexandria police, and the doctors, nurses, and paramedics who saved his life, and the lives of many others in this room. In the aftermath of that terrible shooting, we came together, not as Republicans or Democrats, but as representatives of the people. But it is not enough to come together only in times of tragedy. Tonight, I call upon all of us to set aside our differences, to seek out common ground and to summon the unity we need to deliver for the people we were elected to serve. Over the last year, the world has seen what we always knew: that no people on Earth are so fearless, or daring or determined as Americans. If there is a mountain, we climb it. If there is a frontier, we cross it. If there is a challenge, we tame it. If there is an opportunity, we seize it. So let us begin tonight by recognizing that the state of our union is strong because our people are strong. And together, we are building a safe, strong and proud America. Since the election, we have created 2.4 million new jobs, including 200,000 new jobs in manufacturing alone. After years of wage stagnation, we are finally seeing rising wages. Unemployment claims have hit a 45-year low. African American unemployment stands at the lowest rate ever recorded, and Hispanic American unemployment has also reached the lowest levels in history. Small business confidence is at an all-time high. The stock market has smashed one record after another, gaining $8tn in value. That is great news for Americans’ 401k, retirement, pension, and college savings accounts. And just as I promised the American people from this podium 11 months ago, we enacted the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history. Our massive tax cuts provide tremendous relief for the middle class and small businesses. To lower tax rates for hardworking Americans, we nearly doubled the standard deduction for everyone. Now, the first $24,000 earned by a married couple is completely tax-free. We also doubled the child tax credit. A typical family of four making $75,000 will see their tax bill reduced by $2,000 – slashing their tax bill in half. This April will be the last time you ever file under the old broken system – and millions of Americans will have more take-home pay starting next month. We eliminated an especially cruel tax that fell mostly on Americans making less than $50,000 a year – forcing them to pay tremendous penalties simply because they could not afford government-ordered health plans. We repealed the core of disastrous Obamacare – the individual mandate is now gone. We slashed the business tax rate from 35% all the way down to 21%, so American companies can compete and win against anyone in the world. These changes alone are estimated to increase average family income by more than $4,000. Small businesses have also received a massive tax cut, and can now deduct 20% of their business income. Here tonight are Steve Staub and Sandy Keplinger of Staub Manufacturing – a small business in Ohio. They have just finished the best year in their 20-year history. Because of tax reform, they are handing out raises, hiring an additional 14 people, and expanding into the building next door. One of Staub’s employees, Corey Adams, is also with us tonight. Corey is an all-American worker. He supported himself through high school, lost his job during the 2008 recession, and was later hired by Staub, where he trained to become a welder. Like many hardworking Americans, Corey plans to invest his tax-cut raise into his new home and his two daughters’ education. Please join me in congratulating Corey. Since we passed tax cuts, roughly 3 million workers have already gotten tax cut bonuses – many of them thousands of dollars per worker. Apple has just announced it plans to invest a total of $350bn in America, and hire another 20,000 workers. This is our new American moment. There has never been a better time to start living the American Dream. So to every citizen watching at home tonight – no matter where you have been, or where you come from, this is your time. If you work hard, if you believe in yourself, if you believe in America, then you can dream anything, you can be anything, and together, we can achieve anything. Tonight, I want to talk about what kind of future we are going to have, and what kind of nation we are going to be. All of us, together, as one team, one people, and one American family. We all share the same home, the same heart, the same destiny, and the same great American flag. Together, we are rediscovering the American way. In America, we know that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the center of the American life. Our motto is “in God we trust”. And we celebrate our police, our military, and our amazing veterans as heroes who deserve our total and unwavering support. Here tonight is Preston Sharp, a 12-year-old boy from Redding, California, who noticed that veterans’ graves were not marked with flags on Veterans Day. He decided to change that, and started a movement that has now placed 40,000 flags at the graves of our great heroes. Preston: a job well done. Young patriots like Preston teach all of us about our civic duty as Americans. Preston’s reverence for those who have served our nation reminds us why we salute our flag, why we put our hands on our hearts for the pledge of allegiance, and why we proudly stand for the national anthem. Americans love their country. And they deserve a government that shows them the same love and loyalty in return. For the last year we have sought to restore the bonds of trust between our citizens and their government. Working with the Senate, we are appointing judges who will interpret the constitution as written, including a great new supreme court justice, and more circuit court judges than any new administration in the history of our country. We are defending our second amendment, and have taken historic actions to protect religious liberty. And we are serving our brave veterans, including giving our veterans choice in their healthcare decisions. Last year, the Congress passed, and I signed, the landmark VA Accountability Act. Since its passage, my administration has already removed more than 1,500 VA employees who failed to give our veterans the care they deserve – and we are hiring talented people who love our vets as much as we do. I will not stop until our veterans are properly taken care of, which has been my promise to them from the very beginning of this great journey. All Americans deserve accountability and respect – and that is what we are giving them. So tonight, I call on the Congress to empower every cabinet secretary with the authority to reward good workers – and to remove federal employees who undermine the public trust or fail the American people. In our drive to make Washington accountable, we have eliminated more regulations in our first year than any administration in history. We have ended the war on American energy – and we have ended the war on clean coal. We are now an exporter of energy to the world. In Detroit, I halted government mandates that crippled America’s autoworkers – so we can get the Motor City revving its engines once again. Many car companies are now building and expanding plants in the United States – something we have not seen for decades. Chrysler is moving a major plant from Mexico to Michigan; Toyota and Mazda are opening up a plant in Alabama. Soon, plants will be opening up all over the country. This is all news Americans are unaccustomed to hearing – for many years, companies and jobs were only leaving us. But now they are coming back. Exciting progress is happening every day. To speed access to breakthrough cures and affordable generic drugs, last year the FDA approved more new and generic drugs and medical devices than ever before in our history. We also believe that patients with terminal conditions should have access to experimental treatments that could potentially save their lives. People who are terminally ill should not have to go from country to country to seek a cure – I want to give them a chance right here at home. It is time for the Congress to give these wonderful Americans the “right to try”. One of my greatest priorities is to reduce the price of prescription drugs. In many other countries, these drugs cost far less than what we pay in the United States. That is why I have directed my administration to make fixing the injustice of high drug prices one of our top priorities. Prices will come down. America has also finally turned the page on decades of unfair trade deals that sacrificed our prosperity and shipped away our companies, our jobs, and our nation’s wealth. The era of economic surrender is over. From now on, we expect trading relationships to be fair and to be reciprocal. We will work to fix bad trade deals and negotiate new ones. And we will protect American workers and American intellectual property, through strong enforcement of our trade rules. As we rebuild our industries, it is also time to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. America is a nation of builders. We built the Empire State Building in just one year – is it not a disgrace that it can now take 10 years just to get a permit approved for a simple road? I am asking both parties to come together to give us the safe, fast, reliable, and modern infrastructure our economy needs and our people deserve. Tonight, I am calling on the Congress to produce a bill that generates at least $1.5tn for the new infrastructure investment we need. Every federal dollar should be leveraged by partnering with state and local governments and, where appropriate, tapping into private sector investment – to permanently fix the infrastructure deficit. Any bill must also streamline the permitting and approval process – getting it down to no more than two years, and perhaps even one. Together, we can reclaim our building heritage. We will build gleaming new roads, bridges, highways, railways, and waterways across our land. And we will do it with American heart, American hands and American grit. We want every American to know the dignity of a hard day’s work. We want every child to be safe in their home at night. And we want every citizen to be proud of this land that we love. We can lift our citizens from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity. As tax cuts create new jobs, let us invest in workforce development and job training. Let us open great vocational schools so our future workers can learn a craft and realize their full potential. And let us support working families by supporting paid family leave. As America regains its strength, this opportunity must be extended to all citizens. That is why this year we will embark on reforming our prisons to help former inmates who have served their time get a second chance. Struggling communities, especially immigrant communities, will also be helped by immigration policies that focus on the best interests of American workers and American families. For decades, open borders have allowed drugs and gangs to pour into our most vulnerable communities. They have allowed millions of low-wage workers to compete for jobs and wages against the poorest Americans. Most tragically, they have caused the loss of many innocent lives. Here tonight are two fathers and two mothers: Evelyn Rodriguez, Freddy Cuevas, Elizabeth Alvarado and Robert Mickens. Their two teenage daughters – Kayla Cuevas and Nisa Mickens – were close friends on Long Island. But in September 2016, on the eve of Nisa’s 16th birthday, neither of them came home. These two precious girls were brutally murdered while walking together in their hometown. Six members of the savage gang MS-13 have been charged with Kayla and Nisa’s murders. Many of these gang members took advantage of glaring loopholes in our laws to enter the country as unaccompanied alien minors – and wound up in Kayla and Nisa’s high school. Evelyn, Elizabeth, Freddy, and Robert: tonight, everyone in this chamber is praying for you. Everyone in America is grieving for you. And 320m hearts are breaking for you. We cannot imagine the depth of your sorrow, but we can make sure that other families never have to endure this pain. Tonight, I am calling on the Congress to finally close the deadly loopholes that have allowed MS-13, and other criminals, to break into our country. We have proposed new legislation that will fix our immigration laws, and support our Ice and border patrol agents, so that this cannot ever happen again. The United States is a compassionate nation. We are proud that we do more than any other country to help the needy, the struggling, and the underprivileged all over the world. But as president of the United States, my highest loyalty, my greatest compassion, and my constant concern is for America’s children, America’s struggling workers, and America’s forgotten communities. I want our youth to grow up to achieve great things. I want our poor to have their chance to rise. So tonight, I am extending an open hand to work with members of both parties –- Democrats and Republicans – to protect our citizens of every background, color, religion, and creed. My duty, and the sacred duty of every elected official in this chamber, is to defend Americans – to protect their safety, their families, their communities, and their right to the American Dream. Because Americans are dreamers too. Here tonight is one leader in the effort to defend our country: homeland security investigations special agent Celestino Martinez – he goes by CJ. CJ served 15 years in the air force before becoming an Ice agent and spending the last 15 years fighting gang violence and getting dangerous criminals off our streets. At one point, MS-13 leaders ordered CJ’s murder. But he did not cave to threats or fear. Last May, he commanded an operation to track down gang members on Long Island. His team has arrested nearly 400, including more than 220 from MS-13. CJ: Great work. Now let us get the Congress to send you some reinforcements. Over the next few weeks, the House and Senate will be voting on an immigration reform package. In recent months, my administration has met extensively with both Democrats and Republicans to craft a bipartisan approach to immigration reform. Based on these discussions, we presented the Congress with a detailed proposal that should be supported by both parties as a fair compromise – one where nobody gets everything they want, but where our country gets the critical reforms it needs. Here are the four pillars of our plan: The first pillar of our framework generously offers a path to citizenship for 1.8 million illegal immigrants who were brought here by their parents at a young age – that covers almost three times more people than the previous administration. Under our plan, those who meet education and work requirements, and show good moral character, will be able to become full citizens of the United States. The second pillar fully secures the border. That means building a wall on the southern border, and it means hiring more heroes like CJ to keep our communities safe. Crucially, our plan closes the terrible loopholes exploited by criminals and terrorists to enter our country – and it finally ends the dangerous practice of “catch and release”. The third pillar ends the visa lottery – a program that randomly hands out green cards without any regard for skill, merit, or the safety of our people. It is time to begin moving towards a merit-based immigration system – one that admits people who are skilled, who want to work, who will contribute to our society, and who will love and respect our country. The fourth and final pillar protects the nuclear family by ending chain migration. Under the current broken system, a single immigrant can bring in virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives. Under our plan, we focus on the immediate family by limiting sponsorships to spouses and minor children. This vital reform is necessary, not just for our economy, but for our security, and our future. In recent weeks, two terrorist attacks in New York were made possible by the visa lottery and chain migration. In the age of terrorism, these programs present risks we can no longer afford. It is time to reform these outdated immigration rules, and finally bring our immigration system into the 21st century. These four pillars represent a down-the-middle compromise, and one that will create a safe, modern, and lawful immigration system. For over 30 years, Washington has tried and failed to solve this problem. This Congress can be the one that finally makes it happen. Most importantly, these four pillars will produce legislation that fulfills my ironclad pledge to only sign a bill that puts America first. So let us come together, set politics aside, and finally get the job done. These reforms will also support our response to the terrible crisis of opioid and drug addiction. In 2016, we lost 64,000 Americans to drug overdoses: 174 deaths per day. Seven per hour. We must get much tougher on drug dealers and pushers if we are going to succeed in stopping this scourge. My administration is committed to fighting the drug epidemic and helping get treatment for those in need. The struggle will be long and difficult – but, as Americans always do, we will prevail. As we have seen tonight, the most difficult challenges bring out the best in America. We see a vivid expression of this truth in the story of the Holets family of New Mexico. Ryan Holets is 27 years old, and an officer with the Albuquerque police department. He is here tonight with his wife Rebecca. Last year, Ryan was on duty when he saw a pregnant, homeless woman preparing to inject heroin. When Ryan told her she was going to harm her unborn child, she began to weep. She told him she did not know where to turn, but badly wanted a safe home for her baby. In that moment, Ryan said he felt God speak to him: “You will do it – because you can.” He took out a picture of his wife and their four kids. Then, he went home to tell his wife Rebecca. In an instant, she agreed to adopt. The Holets named their new daughter Hope. Ryan and Rebecca: you embody the goodness of our Nation. Thank you, and congratulations. As we rebuild America’s strength and confidence at home, we are also restoring our strength and standing abroad. Around the world, we face rogue regimes, terrorist groups, and rivals like China and Russia that challenge our interests, our economy, and our values. In confronting these dangers, we know that weakness is the surest path to conflict, and unmatched power is the surest means of our defense. For this reason, I am asking the Congress to end the dangerous defense sequester and fully fund our great military. As part of our defense, we must modernize and rebuild our nuclear arsenal, hopefully never having to use it, but making it so strong and powerful that it will deter any acts of aggression. Perhaps someday in the future there will be a magical moment when the countries of the world will get together to eliminate their nuclear weapons. Unfortunately, we are not there yet. Last year, I also pledged that we would work with our allies to extinguish Isis from the face of the Earth. One year later, I am proud to report that the coalition to defeat Isis has liberated almost 100% of the territory once held by these killers in Iraq and Syria. But there is much more work to be done. We will continue our fight until Isis is defeated. Army Staff Sergeant Justin Peck is here tonight. Near Raqqa last November, Justin and his comrade, Chief Petty Officer Kenton Stacy, were on a mission to clear buildings that Isis had rigged with explosives so that civilians could return to the city. Clearing the second floor of a vital hospital, Kenton Stacy was severely wounded by an explosion. Immediately, Justin bounded into the booby-trapped building and found Kenton in bad shape. He applied pressure to the wound and inserted a tube to reopen an airway. He then performed CPR for 20 straight minutes during the ground transport and maintained artificial respiration through two hours of emergency surgery. Kenton Stacy would have died if not for Justin’s selfless love for a fellow warrior. Tonight, Kenton is recovering in Texas. Raqqa is liberated. And Justin is wearing his new Bronze Star, with a “V” for “Valor”. Staff Sergeant Peck: all of America salutes you. Terrorists who do things like place bombs in civilian hospitals are evil. When possible, we annihilate them. When necessary, we must be able to detain and question them. But we must be clear: terrorists are not merely criminals. They are unlawful enemy combatants. And when captured overseas, they should be treated like the terrorists they are. In the past, we have foolishly released hundreds of dangerous terrorists, only to meet them again on the battlefield – including the Isis leader, al-Baghdadi. So today, I am keeping another promise. I just signed an order directing Secretary Mattis to re-examine our military detention policy and to keep open the detention facilities at Guantánamo Bay. I am also asking the Congress to ensure that, in the fight against Isis and al-Qaida, we continue to have all necessary power to detain terrorists – wherever we chase them down. Our warriors in Afghanistan also have new rules of engagement. Along with their heroic Afghan partners, our military is no longer undermined by artificial timelines, and we no longer tell our enemies our plans. Last month, I also took an action endorsed unanimously by the Senate just months before: I recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Shortly afterwards, dozens of countries voted in the United Nations General Assembly against America’s sovereign right to make this recognition. American taxpayers generously send those same countries billions of dollars in aid every year. That is why, tonight, I am asking the Congress to pass legislation to help ensure American foreign-assistance dollars always serve American interests, and only go to America’s friends. As we strengthen friendships around the world, we are also restoring clarity about our adversaries. When the people of Iran rose up against the crimes of their corrupt dictatorship, I did not stay silent. America stands with the people of Iran in their courageous struggle for freedom. I am asking the Congress to address the fundamental flaws in the terrible Iran nuclear deal. My administration has also imposed tough sanctions on the communist and socialist dictatorships in Cuba and Venezuela. But no regime has oppressed its own citizens more totally or brutally than the cruel dictatorship in North Korea. North Korea’s reckless pursuit of nuclear missiles could very soon threaten our homeland. We are waging a campaign of maximum pressure to prevent that from happening. Past experience has taught us that complacency and concessions only invite aggression and provocation. I will not repeat the mistakes of past administrations that got us into this dangerous position. We need only look at the depraved character of the North Korean regime to understand the nature of the nuclear threat it could pose to America and our allies. Otto Warmbier was a hardworking student at the University of Virginia. On his way to study abroad in Asia, Otto joined a tour to North Korea. At its conclusion, this wonderful young man was arrested and charged with crimes against the state. After a shameful trial, the dictatorship sentenced Otto to 15 years of hard labor, before returning him to America last June – horribly injured and on the verge of death. He passed away just days after his return. Otto’s parents, Fred and Cindy Warmbier, are with us tonight – along with Otto’s brother and sister, Austin and Greta. You are powerful witnesses to a menace that threatens our world, and your strength inspires us all. Tonight, we pledge to honor Otto’s memory with American resolve. Finally, we are joined by one more witness to the ominous nature of this regime. His name is Mr Ji Seong-ho. In 1996, Seong-ho was a starving boy in North Korea. One day, he tried to steal coal from a railroad car to barter for a few scraps of food. In the process, he passed out on the train tracks, exhausted from hunger. He woke up as a train ran over his limbs. He then endured multiple amputations without anything to dull the pain. His brother and sister gave what little food they had to help him recover and ate dirt themselves – permanently stunting their own growth. Later, he was tortured by North Korean authorities after returning from a brief visit to China. His tormentors wanted to know if he had met any Christians. He had – and he resolved to be free. Seong-ho traveled thousands of miles on crutches across China and south-east Asia to freedom. Most of his family followed. His father was caught trying to escape, and was tortured to death. Today he lives in Seoul, where he rescues other defectors, and broadcasts into North Korea what the regime fears the most – the truth. Today he has a new leg, but Seong-ho, I understand you still keep those crutches as a reminder of how far you have come. Your great sacrifice is an inspiration to us all. Seong-ho’s story is a testament to the yearning of every human soul to live in freedom. It was that same yearning for freedom that nearly 250 years ago gave birth to a special place called America. It was a small cluster of colonies caught between a great ocean and a vast wilderness. But it was home to an incredible people with a revolutionary idea: that they could rule themselves. That they could chart their own destiny. And that, together, they could light up the world. That is what our country has always been about. That is what Americans have always stood for, always strived for, and always done. Atop the dome of this Capitol stands the Statue of Freedom. She stands tall and dignified among the monuments to our ancestors who fought and lived and died to protect her. Monuments to Washington and Jefferson – to Lincoln and King. Memorials to the heroes of Yorktown and Saratoga – to young Americans who shed their blood on the shores of Normandy, and the fields beyond. And others, who went down in the waters of the Pacific and the skies over Asia. And freedom stands tall over one more monument: this one. This Capitol. This living monument to the American people. A people whose heroes live not only in the past, but all around us – defending hope, pride, and the American way. They work in every trade. They sacrifice to raise a family. They care for our children at home. They defend our flag abroad. They are strong moms and brave kids. They are firefighters, police officers, border agents, medics, and marines. But above all else, they are Americans. And this Capitol, this city, and this nation, belong to them. Our task is to respect them, to listen to them, to serve them, to protect them, and to always be worthy of them. Americans fill the world with art and music. They push the bounds of science and discovery. And they forever remind us of what we should never forget: The people dreamed this country. The people built this country. And it is the people who are making America great again. As long as we are proud of who we are, and what we are fighting for, there is nothing we cannot achieve. As long as we have confidence in our values, faith in our citizens, and trust in our God, we will not fail. Our families will thrive. Our people will prosper. And our nation will forever be safe and strong and proud and mighty and free. Thank you, and God bless America."
"G.O.P.’s Israel Support Deepens as Political Contributions Shift","Advertisement Supported by By  Eric Lipton WASHINGTON — As the proposed agreement over Iran’s nuclear program is debated in coming weeks, President Obama will make his case to a Congress controlled by Republicans who are more fervently pro-Israel than ever, partly a result of ideology, but also a product of a surge in donations and campaign spending on their behalf by a small group of wealthy donors. One of the surprisingly high-profile critics is Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas , who burst to prominence with a letter signed by 46 Republican colleagues to leaders of Iran warning against a deal. Mr. Cotton, echoing criticism by Israeli leaders, swiftly denounced the framework reached on Thursday as “a list of dangerous U.S. concessions that will put Iran on the path to nuclear weapons” — words, his colleagues say, that expressed his deep concern about Iran’s threat to Israel’s security. But it is also true that Mr. Cotton and other Republicans benefited from millions in campaign spending in 2014 by several pro-Israel Republican billionaires and other influential American donors who helped them topple Democratic opponents. Republicans currently in the Senate raised more money during the 2014 election cycle in direct, federally regulated campaign contributions from individuals and political action committees deemed pro-Israel than their Democratic counterparts, according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics and analyzed for The New York Times by a second nonprofit, MapLight . The Republican advantage was the first in more than a decade. The alliances in Congress that pro-Israel donors have built will certainly be tested as they lobby lawmakers to oppose the deal with Iran and perhaps even expand sanctions against the country, despite objections from the Obama administration. Donors say the trend toward Republicans among wealthy, hawkish contributors is at least partly responsible for inspiring stronger support for Israel among party lawmakers who already had pro-Israel views. “Absolutely, it is a factor,” said Marc Felgoise, who manages the Philadelphia Israel Network, a campaign fund-raising group, and whose own contributions have shifted to Republicans, though he still supports many Democrats. “They are trying to cater to people who are ultimately going to support them.” Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, saw his donations from pro-Israel donors soar to about $285,000 in the 2014 election cycle from less than $100,000 in 2008, during his previous election, the analysis by MapLight shows. Pro-Israel contributions to Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, plummeted to less than $150,000 in 2014, when he was also re-elected, from nearly $300,000 in 2008, according to this count. But few candidates have benefited as much as Mr. Cotton. The Emergency Committee for Israel , led by William Kristol, editor of the conservative Weekly Standard, spent $960,000 to support Mr. Cotton . In that same race, Paul Singer, a hedge fund billionaire from New York and a leading donor to pro-Israel causes, contributed $250,000 to Arkansas Horizon , another independent expenditure group supporting Mr. Cotton. Seth Klarman, a Boston-based pro-Israel billionaire, contributed $100,000. The political action committee run by John Bolton , the United Nations ambassador under President George W. Bush and an outspoken supporter of Israel, spent at least $825,000 to support Mr. Cotton. That PAC is in part financed by other major pro-Israel donors, including Irving and Cherna Moskowitz of Miami, who contributed 99 percent of their $1.1 million in 2012 races to Republican candidates and causes. Jeremy Ben-Ami, president of J Street, a liberal pro-Israel group, said this relatively small group of very wealthy Jewish-Americans distorted the views among Jews nationwide who remain supportive of the Democratic Party and a more nuanced relationship with Israel. “The very, very limited set of people who do their politics simply through the lens of Israel — that small group is tilting more heavily Republican now,” he said, adding, “But it is dangerous for American politics as too many people do not understand that of the six million American Jews, this is only a handful.” The deepening support for Israel among congressional Republicans reflects a significant shift for the party that has been playing out for several decades, said Geoffrey Kabaservice, a Republican Party historian. “Israel did not traditionally represent that kind of emotional focus for any element of the Republican Party,” he said. “But the feeling now is that it is a winning issue, as it helps them to appear strong on foreign policy.” Mr. Cotton declined to be interviewed, but his communications director, Caroline Rabbitt, said his aggressive support of Israel was based on longstanding beliefs, not any particular financial backer. “He knows Israel is one of the most important allies and a beacon of democracy in an otherwise perilous part of the world,” she said. Over all, the most significant contributor by far to Republican supporters of Israel has been Sheldon Adelson, the casino magnate, who with his wife has invested at least $100 million in conservative causes over the last four years. A large chunk was spent on the 2012 presidential campaign, but Senate Republicans also benefited, and could soon again, particularly those considering a run for president. The scope of the alliance was evident last month when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, at the invitation of Speaker John A. Boehner, spoke to a joint meeting of Congress, over Mr. Obama’s objections. After the speech, some of the nation’s most important pro-Israel donors, including Mr. Adelson, gathered with more than a dozen Republican members of Congress at the nearby Capitol Hill Club. “It was a love fest,” said Kenneth J. Bialkin , a corporate lawyer and donor who attended. The Senate floor has become another showcase for Republicans to demonstrate commitment to Israel. Senators Marco Rubio, who is expected to announce his presidential candidacy on April 13, and Mark S. Kirk, a moderate from Illinois, were among the Republicans who offered budget amendments related to Israel last month. Mr. Rubio blasted the White House for recent remarks critical of Mr. Netanyahu, calling them “outrageous.” The shift has also meant the Republican Party today accepts little dissent on the topic of Israel, said Scott McConnell, a founding editor of The American Conservative, an outcome he believes is in part driven by the demands of financial supporters. “Republicans interested in foreign policy used to understand that it was not in America’s national interest to ignore entirely Arab claims against Israel,” he said. “Now, there is a fanatical feeling of one-sidedness.” Several Republican senators and champions of Israel rejected any suggestion that the intensity of the party’s recent support had anything to do with money. “The Senate is the place where traditionally foreign policy has been a central issue because we have the unique responsibility to approve or disapprove treaties,” said Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, another major recipient of financial support from pro-Israel donors. What is clear is that pro-Israel leaders have developed close relationships with some of the Republican champions like Mr. Cotton. It is highly unusual for a freshman senator to take a bold step like his Iran letter, and then persuade dozens of colleagues to endorse it. A spokesman for Mr. Cotton said the senator had written the letter himself, though Mr. Kristol said he had had a conversation with him about it. “I know there has been all this fervent speculation that Tom Cotton and Bill Kristol and Sheldon Adelson were at some private room at the Venetian cooking this up,” said Noah Pollak, the executive director of the Emergency Committee for Israel , referring to Mr. Adelson’s casino in Las Vegas, where many prominent Republicans and Jewish leaders will gather this month. “But Tom is a smart guy and has a long record of thinking about the Middle East, and he is entrepreneurial. Tom wrote this letter.” Mr. Graham said it was the tension between Mr. Netanyahu and the Obama administration that had highlighted the strength of the ties between Republicans and Israel. “But at the end of the day, the foundation of the U.S.-Israel relationship is bipartisan,” he said. “There is wide and deep Democratic support for the state of Israel. It’s just sort of getting left out of the story line here.” An earlier version of this article misstated how Paul Singer, a hedge fund billionaire from New York, made a donation to Arkansas Horizon, an independent expenditure group supporting Senator Tom Cotton. He made the donation himself, not through a firm he runs. The article also misstated how Seth Klarman, a Boston-based billionaire, contributed to the group. He also made the donation himself, not through his investment firm. Jennifer Steinhauer contributed reporting. Advertisement"
"Hunt and Fox's Japanese fumble is a sign of UK's weakness","Attempt to hustle Japan into a trade deal highlights the problems facing ‘global Britain’  Mon 18 Feb 2019 16.20 GMT   Last modified on Mon 18 Feb 2019 21.57 GMT   It takes a lot to anger the unfailingly polite, anglophile Japanese. But Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, and Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, appear to have managed it with their ill-judged attempt to hustle Tokyo into a quick-fire Brexit trade deal. The diplomatic fumble has highlighted rapidly escalating difficulties facing “ global Britain ” – the government’s nebulous vision for life after the EU – in forging new business and trade relationships around the world without an agreed post-Brexit strategy. Leading Brexiters such as Fox, David Davis and Nigel Farage predicted the process would be quick and easy, but events are proving them wrong. With 29 March fast approaching, Britain has replaced only seven of the EU’s 69 collective preferential trade deals. The “magnificent seven” comprise Switzerland, Chile, Mauritius, Madagascar, Zimbabwe, the Faroe Islands and the Seychelles. Together, they account for a mere £16bn out of a total of £117bn in British trade with EU-partnered countries. In contrast, preferential arrangements with bigger EU partners such as Japan , South Korea, Turkey and Norway have not been replaced, nor does it appear they will be before the deadline. With market analysts warning a no-deal Brexit is a growing possibility, pressure on Fox is intensifying. This may explain last week’s clumsy warning to Japan, in a letter co-authored with Hunt, that “time is of the essence”. Like his predecessors, Shinzō Abe, Japan’s prime minister, has pursued a close diplomatic and security relationship with Britain. Japanese businesses and carmakers have invested heavily. So officials in Tokyo reportedly took strong exception to the Fox-Hunt suggestion of foot-dragging, suggesting it smacked of arrogance. Fox was already struggling with tougher than expected Japanese negotiating tactics. Given widespread perceptions of British weakness, bordering on desperation, other countries, less well disposed than Japan, can be expected to take an even harder line. The question of ministerial incompetence aside, Britain is further disadvantaged by a lack of trade talks specialists – a point made by the Japanese – and ongoing domestic political divisions. Add to that well-founded concerns about a contracting global economy, the US-China trade war and a broader sense that Britain’s standing on the world stage is in decline, and the future negotiating environment looks hostile. Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, served up what he and others among Britain’s European friends see as an unpalatable truth. Britain is “a waning country” that is “too small to appear on the world stage on its own” , he said last week. All this renders the task of creating new bilateral trade deals with the world’s largest economies, outside the EU’s 69-nation umbrella framework, ever more daunting. China’s weekend decision to cancel high-levels talks over disobliging remarks by the defence secretary, Gavin Williamson , showed how vulnerable Britain is to geopolitical as well as financial pressure from the big emerging powers. The UK’s dependence on Chinese investment, for example in nuclear power, is another weakness open to exploitation. Britain’s refusal to ostracise the Chinese telecoms giant Huawei may please Beijing but will infuriate the US. Was the decision influenced by Brexit considerations? There could also be a high price to pay, in terms of political values and human rights, in obtaining deals from repressive regimes in China, Saudi Arabia and Turkey. And Britain’s often unhappy colonial legacy must be factored in, too. Many in India will view London’s new neediness as a chance to redress old wrongs. For his part, Donald Trump, a Brexit enthusiast, has criticised May for conceding too much to the EU while promising an expanded relationship. The US is already Britain’s biggest non-EU trade partner, and London clings rather pathetically to its so-called special relationship. Money-minded, hard-nosed Trump is certain to drive a hard bargain, and there’s a real risk of bullying. Any agreement with the US could come with political as well as commercial and health and safety strings attached, for instance on Iran, where current policy diverges. Trump’s deep hostility to to the World Trade Organization (“one of the worst deals ever”) means, meanwhile, that a no-deal default to WTO rules would not necessarily win Washington’s approval or support. Such an outcome would truly leave Britain all at sea, lost and adrift somewhere between Europe and America."
"How the nuclear-armed nations brought the North Korea crisis on themselves","Failure to honour terms of the 1970 nuclear non-proliferation treaty has helped create ground for Kim Jong-un’s recklessness  Tue 5 Sep 2017 05.00 BST   Last modified on Mon 27 Nov 2017 17.32 GMT   North Korea’s defiant pursuit of nuclear weapons capabilities, dramatised by last weekend’s powerful underground test and a recent long-range ballistic missile launch over Japan, has been almost universally condemned as posing a grave, unilateral threat to international peace and security. The growing North Korean menace also reflects the chronic failure of multilateral counter-proliferation efforts and, in particular, the longstanding refusal of acknowledged nuclear-armed states such as the US and Britain to honour a legal commitment to reduce and eventually eliminate their arsenals. In other words, the past and present leaders of the US, Russia, China, France and the UK, whose governments signed but have not fulfilled the terms of the 1970 nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT), have to some degree brought the North Korea crisis on themselves. Kim Jong-un’s recklessness and bad faith is a product of their own. The NPT , signed by 191 countries, is probably the most successful arms control treaty ever. When conceived in 1968, at the height of the cold war, the mass proliferation of nuclear weapons was considered a real possibility. Since its inception and prior to North Korea, only India, Pakistan and Israel are known to have joined the nuclear “club” in almost half a century. To work fully, the NPT relies on keeping a crucial bargain: non-nuclear-armed states agree never to acquire the weapons, while nuclear-armed states agree to share the benefits of peaceful nuclear technology and pursue nuclear disarmament with the ultimate aim of eliminating them. This, in effect, was the guarantee offered to vulnerable, insecure outlier states such as North Korea. The guarantee was a dud, however, and the bargain has never been truly honoured. Rather than reducing their nuclear arsenals, the US, Russia and China have modernised and expanded them. Britain has eliminated some of its capability, but it is nevertheless renewing and updating Trident. France clings fiercely to its “ force de frappe ”. Altogether, the main nuclear-weapon states have an estimated 22,000 nuclear bombs. A report by the non-governmental British-American Security Information Council in May said nuclear security was getting worse. “The need for nuclear disarmament through multilateral diplomacy is greater now than it has been at any stage since the end of the cold war. Trust and confidence in the existing nuclear non-proliferation regime is fraying, tensions are high, goals are misaligned and dialogue is irregular,” the report said. “Internationally, relationships between the nuclear-weapon states have deteriorated, in particular between the US and Russia, and to some extent, China … All nuclear-armed states are modernising their nuclear forces, at a worldwide cost of $1tn per decade … Attention tends to be focused on specific cases of proliferation concern, such as North Korea and Iran, at the expense of the bigger picture.” Multilateral forums for advancing nuclear disarmament are in crisis. The next NPT review conference is not due until 2020. Like its 2015 predecessor, it is not expected to achieve much. The UN-backed conference on disarmament, which helped produce conventions banning biological and chemical weapons and initiated the 1996 comprehensive test ban treaty, is politically polarised and struggling to agree key measures such as a fissile material cut-off treaty. Meanwhile, as South Korea and Japan consider acquiring nuclear weapons , Donald Trump appears irrationally determined to scrap one of the few recent arms control successes – the landmark 2015 nuclear deal with Iran . There has been one big breakthrough this year, the under-reported adoption by 122 countries at the UN in July of a new treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons, which envisages an outright ban on the use of all nukes. It has, however, been potentially fatally undermined by a boycott by the nuclear powers. The US, Britain and France declared , cynically as critics saw it, that they preferred to stick with the never-ending NPT route to disarmament. “This initiative clearly disregards the realities of the international security environment,” they said in a joint statement. The ineffectiveness of current arms control and counter-proliferation efforts has helped to create an environment in which North Korea, allegedly using smuggled, Russian-designed ballistic missile engines, is rapidly advancing its nuclear ambitions with apparent impunity, at great risk to international stability. Multilateral arms control failures also mean the Korean “solution” Trump talks about with increasing frequency – the use of preventive military action, notwithstanding its illegality under international law – could, if applied, spell the end of deterrence and the beginning of an unchecked global nuclear arms race."
"Ted Cruz: A Pressure Point for North Korea","Advertisement Supported by Op-Ed Contributor By  Ted Cruz On Oct. 31, the State Department faces a critical decision in our relations with the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. The Iran-Russia-North Korea sanctions bill enacted in August included legislation I introduced that requires the secretary of state to decide whether to relist North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism within 90 days. Look at the accusations against Pyongyang: the unspeakable treatment of Otto Warmbier ; the assassination of a member of the Kim family with chemical weapons on foreign soil; collusion with Iran to develop nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles; cyberattacks on American film companies; support for Syria’s chemical weapons program; arms sales to Hezbollah and Hamas; and attempts to assassinate dissidents in exile. Given this, the decision should be easy. In fact, Americans could be forgiven for wondering why North Korea is not already designated as a sponsor of terrorism. It used to be — and the story behind the decision to remove that designation nearly 10 years ago is the key to understanding America’s failed assumptions about North Korea, how they led to Pyongyang obtaining its nuclear arsenal, and why the United States needs to reverse its approach and relist Pyongyang immediately. On Feb. 13, 2007, the State Department signed a deal with North Korea in pursuit of a grand bargain: exchanging Pyongyang’s promise of eventual denuclearization for Washington’s guarantees for full diplomatic recognition. Standing in the way, however, was a decision President Ronald Reagan made nearly 20 years earlier, designating North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism largely in response to its complicity in a 1987 plane bombing that killed 115 people. Aside from the many stringent limitations a terrorism-sponsor designation imposes on a state, the label serves as a formal indication from the United States that any positive development of diplomatic relations is contingent on abandoning the financing and support of terrorism. Indeed, the State Department linked Pyongyang’s ties to terrorist groups and its nuclear program as a rationale for maintaining the terror designation in 2005. Two years later, Israel destroyed a nuclear reactor believed to have been built with North Korean help in Syria, a designated state sponsor of terrorism. Although all this was understood at the time, the United States elected to delist North Korea in 2008 — and in so doing, again fell back into its pattern of misunderstanding rogue regimes. When North Korea reneged on its promise to forgo nuclear weapons in the early 1990s, President Bill Clinton’s administration put together the “Agreed Framework” that paved Pyongyang’s path to nuclearization. When North Korea’s leader at the time, Kim Jong-il, withdrew from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in 2003, confirming that he intended to build a nuclear weapon, President George W. Bush pushed for the China-led six-party talks with North Korea. When the country tested its second nuclear weapon in 2009, President Barack Obama opted for “strategic patience.” Three subsequent tests showed just how misguided this was. It is time to acknowledge that North Korea may never be interested in negotiating away its nuclear deterrent. Of course we should continue to leave the door open for serious discussions if the situation changes, but the United States government does our citizens — and the world — a disservice if it continually discounts the centrality of nuclear weapons to the Kim regime. They are not a mere insurance policy for survival. They are a means to a more sweeping end: reunification of the Korean Peninsula on Pyongyang’s terms. We must seriously consider the possibility that the North’s current leader, Kim Jong-un, is preparing to use nuclear weapons to drive American forces out of South Korea and coerce Seoul — even at the risk of fighting a limited nuclear war. Given this, the United States must approach North Korea with sobriety and urgency. The Trump administration has the opportunity to join both houses of Congress in acknowledging the truth about North Korea and using it to open new opportunities to maximize pressure. Among North Korea’s many significant forms of illicit financing are foreign slave labor and money laundering. From Africa to Europe, North Korean diplomats exploit their consular posts to launder money at the expense of international comity. If North Korea is relisted, these nations would face a significant decision: Is continuing diplomatic and economic relations with a state that uses diplomacy and finance to export and foment terrorism in their interest? It would pose an even deeper question to the United States: Will we continue our diplomatic overtures to the Kim regime on the flawed assumption that it is interested in a future without nuclear weapons? It is because of America’s bipartisan belief in North Korea’s potential amenity in a political settlement, captured in the 2008 delisting, that North Korea can now marry a miniaturized warhead to an intercontinental ballistic missile. Relisting Pyongyang is the first step toward a strategic vision based on facts rather than aspirations. We must tell the truth about the dangerous ambitions of North Korea and once again list it as a state sponsor of terrorism, a move that only strengthens our hand and weakens that of Kim Jong-un. I strongly urge the State Department to relist North Korea, and to meet this challenge with the resolve it has long demanded. Ted Cruz is a Republican senator from Texas. Advertisement"
"Bernie Sanders on how to avoid war with North Korea","In this excerpt of The Bernie Sanders Show, former secretary of defense William J Perry and Sanders have a conversation about North Korea and nuclear weapons  Wed 19 Jul 2017 15.34 BST   Last modified on Tue 5 Sep 2017 08.12 BST   Sanders: Welcome everyone. This show has a tendency to focus on domestic issues. On the economy, healthcare, education, the environment. We are delighted to be talking about a topic that deserves a lot more discussion: foreign policy. Former secretary Perry, thank you so much for joining us today. Perry: Senator Sanders, the problems you have to face every day are healthcare, budget, education and so on. But there is a real existential danger we face with nuclear weapons. Sanders: There are no ifs, buts or maybes. In a world where many countries have nuclear weapons, this is an issue that we have got to deal with. Mr Secretary, you and a number of retired senior security officials released a letter recently urging President Trump to begin negotiations – without preconditions – with North Korea over its nuclear program. In your judgment, why is that the best course of action? Haven’t we tried negotiation with North Korea in the past? Perry: North Korea today has a real nuclear weapons arsenal. That’s very dangerous. But North Korea is not a crazy nation. They are reckless, ruthless, but they are not crazy. They are open to logic and reason. Their main objective is to sustain their regime. If we can find a way of dealing with them that they can see gives them an opportunity to stay in the regime, we can get results. Sanders : But do you think Kim Jong-un is a leader with whom we can seriously negotiate? Perry: He is a leader with whom we must negotiate. He is working on getting an ICBM [intercontinental ballistic missile]. In all probability, he will achieve that goal within a few years. Sanders : An ICBM capable of reaching the United States? Perry: Yes. In the meantime, he already has medium-range missiles capable of reaching Tokyo and Seoul. The problem is here and now. We can do things to stop that and slow him down, and we should be doing those things for our own security. Sanders : You mentioned that Kim Jong-un is not crazy. What do we know about this very secretive regime? Perry: Everything we know suggests that he is just an extension of the Kim family. All of the leaders they’ve had in the past have been ruthless. All of them have been reckless. All of them have pursued a nuclear weapon program. His main objective is to stay in power. We have to understand, that’s what he’s trying to achieve. Our understanding and our goal would be to lower the danger from the nuclear weapons and, eventually, to eliminate them. I think its possible to achieve that. It will require some teaming with China. With China, we can put together both the carrots and sticks. We cannot simply point to China and say: “You solve the problem.” We have to work together with them. Sanders : Do you have confidence that China is prepared to do what it takes to develop a nuclear agreement with North Korea? Perry: China is more concerned about the nuclear weapons program in the North than they were a decade ago. But they have to be convinced that the negotiating path that we put together is not designed to overthrow the regime. They are opposed to doing that. As long as they think that’s the objective, they will not team up with us. If we can convince them that we have the same objective, which is to lower the nuclear danger, then we can put together a [negotiation] package with China. Sanders : If China were seriously involved in that effort, what might that nuclear agreement look like? This is a country that has in the past allowed its people to literally starve to death in order to fund a nuclear program Perry: We’d have to look at it in two stages. The first-stage agreement would be to lower the dangers. We’d do that by freezing their missile testing, and by freezing their nuclear testing. That is an objective in and of itself worth achieving because it would keep them from getting an ICBM. It would also keep them from getting a hydrogen bomb. That objective is worth achieving. Using that as a platform, we could then work to get them to roll back the nuclear platform. So we’d have to see it, I believe, as a two-stage program. Sanders : And what does one offer them to achieve that? Perry: We need to offer both carrots and sticks. We and our allies, Japan and South Korea, have many carrots to offer. South Korea and Japan have both offered economic incentives in the past, and would be willing to offer them again. The US could offer security assurances. That doesn’t cost anything, but it’s something we could offer. The sticks would have to come from China, which would be cutting off the trade they have. They would not do that by themselves. As part of a package, we might be able to persuade them to do it. Sanders : From your perspective, the main goal of the regime is to maintain their power? Perry: That is their goal: to sustain the regime in power. If they see a package that allows them to do that, they may be willing to cut back the nuclear weapons. Sanders : This is a country that has in the past allowed its people to literally starve to death in order to fund a nuclear program. Is that correct? Perry: This is an abhorrent regime. It’s a regime that we rightly detest. But they do have nuclear weapons. We cannot ignore that fact. We have to deal with that fact. Those nuclear weapons pose a threat to South Korea, Japan and, in time, will pose a threat to us – Sanders : Right – and to the whole world. Perry: We have to separate out the variables here. There are the things they are doing that we don’t like, and then there are the things that could cause nuclear catastrophe. Sanders : Right, I get that. But what I’m suggesting is that a country with severe economic problems in a rational situation [might be willing to] accept some carrots that might be offered, at least in terms of economic aid – Perry: We’ve offered them carrots in the past. They are not enough. They’ve demonstrated over and over again that they are willing to suffer economic hardship, they are willing to let their people starve in order to keep the nuclear program. We must learn from that lesson. Sanders : Well, if there’s anybody who knows about that, it’s you. Could you review for us the work you did and what happened? Perry: I was involved first of all as a secretary of defense in the 90s. The first crisis I faced as secretary was a crisis with North Korea. That was in 1994. We nearly went to war with North Korea. Sanders : Remind us, as not everybody remembers that. The actions they take and the actions we take could lead to conflict that could well escalate into full-scale war Perry: North Korea had a nuclear facility at a place called Yongbyon. They were processing plutonium. Had they completed that processing, they would have had enough plutonium to build six nuclear bombs. We were determined that they should not do that. We confronted them and we threatened them with military action. We offered them economic incentives. A combination of that led to the agreement known as the Agreed Framework which, for at least a period of seven to eight years, stopped the program. Sanders : It did stop the program? Perry: Yes, it did stop the program at Yongbyon. It did not stop their aspirations for nuclear weapons, but it did stop that program. Had we not had the Agreed Framework, which was signed in 1994, by the year 2000 they could have had as many as 50 nuclear weapons. That bought us time. It didn’t solve the fundamental problem of how they provide for their security. That had to be done in future negotiation. Sanders : Do you have optimism that the approach you are suggesting can succeed? Perry: I have optimism that it can succeed if we take the opportunity. But I do not have optimism that we are going to take the opportunity. That involves some very sophisticated diplomacy. First and foremost, in forming some sort of a team with China, where we agree on what the objectives are, we agree on what the carrots and sticks we are going to offer them. If we can put together that diplomatic package, then we have a great chance at succeeding. But there is a big “if”, there. It requires us dealing constructively and intelligently with China, to make them see we have the same objectives and are trying to achieve the same thing. Sanders : Is there anything that we can learn from the Iran nuclear agreement that could give us some lessons for North Korea? Perry: Yes, I believe so. The Iran agreement successfully – as a minimum – put off the program for a decade or so. That in itself was worth achieving. It also gives us a platform for which we can go further than that. With North Korea, we should use that as a model. We should use it as a way to delay the nuclear program, and their long-range missile program. I think we can do that. Then we may be able to go further and get the eventual elimination of nuclear weapons in North Korea. We have to understand, though, that they have regime survival very strongly in mind. They see the nuclear weapons program as a key to that. So they may look to ways to evade the agreement – as they have done in the past – so we should be very wary of dealing with North Korea. But the alternative is very, very stark. The option of a pre-emptive strike, which we had considered in 1994, is not really there today. A pre-emptive strike has very few upsides, and very many, and very great downsides. So I would not recommend that. I considered it in the past, but I would not recommend it today. Sanders : We have, to say the least, a very, very difficult situation. Perry: Very difficult and very dangerous. It’s not dangerous because North Korea is going to launch nuclear weapons at Seoul or Japan or the United States in an unprovoked way. They are not crazy. They know that if they did that, the regime would be destroyed. Deterrence does work with North Korea. But the actions they take and the actions we take could lead to some sort of a military conflict. That could well escalate into full-scale war. In a full-scale war, North Korea would lose. The military power of the United States and South Korea is far superior to theirs. But as they lost, they might use their nuclear weapons. That’s what’s dangerous. Not that we deliberately enter into a nuclear war, but that we would blunder into a nuclear war. That would be truly catastrophic. Sanders : It truly would."
"Everyone Is Going All the Way","Advertisement Supported by By  Thomas L. Friedman TEL AVIV — It is hard to spend a week in Israel and not come away feeling that Israelis have the wind at their backs. They’ve built an awesome high-tech industry, and everyone’s kid seems to work for a start-up. Even Israeli Arabs have caught the bug — the number studying for B.A. degrees at Israeli universities rose 60 percent in the last seven years, to 47,000. Regionally, the Arabs and Palestinians have never been weaker, and under President Trump, Israel has never had a more unquestioningly friendly United States. Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, asking Israel for nothing in return. The Arab states barely made a peep. Alas, though, all of this wind has whetted the appetite of Israel’s settlers and ruling Likud Party to go to extremes. Reuters reported on Dec. 31 that the “Likud Party unanimously urged legislators in a nonbinding resolution … to effectively annex Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, land that Palestinians want for a future state.” Sure, the world would scream “apartheid,” but Israeli rightists shrug that the world will get used to it. Nikki Haley will cover for Israel at the U.N. Sheldon Adelson will keep Trump and the G.O.P. in line. And the Arab regimes, which need Israel to counter Iran, will look the other away. It always plays out that way, and the settlers see that, so, they ask, why wait? They think they can annex the West Bank without giving Palestinians citizenship; they’ll just let the Palestinians vote in their own elections. And then it popped into my head: I’ve seen this play before. It was May 17, 1983 — the day Israel, a year after invading Lebanon, signed a peace accord with Beirut. “Signed” isn’t exactly right. Israel (backed by the U.S.) imposed virtually all its security demands on a weak Lebanese government, including a framework for normalizing trade and diplomacy. Back then, Israel also had a right-wing leader, Menachem Begin, embraced by a superfriendly President Ronald Reagan. Egypt had just signed a peace treaty and dropped out of the conflict, and another young Arab leader — Lebanese Christian warlord Bashir Gemayel — beckoned Israel to join him in crushing the Palestinians and remaking the Middle East together. My Washington Post Beirut colleague Jonathan Randal wrote a book about that moment, “Going All The Way: Christian Warlords, Israeli Adventurers and the War in Lebanon.” I always loved that title — going all the way. It’s a recurring theme out here, and it almost always ends with a “Thelma and Louise” moment — partners driving over a cliff — and so it did with Israel in 1983. Lebanese militias, led by Hezbollah, quickly emerged to resist the May 17 treaty. On March 5, 1984, only 10 months after it was signed, I wrote in this paper from Beirut : “Lebanon today formally canceled its troop withdrawal accord with Israel,” marking “the end of the so-called ‘Israeli era’ in Lebanese politics and to shift Lebanon solidly back into the Syrian-Arab fold.” It was nice while it lasted. Why do I tell this story? Because everywhere I look today I see people going all the way . I see Republicans trashing two of our most sacred institutions — the F.B.I. and the Justice Department — because these agencies won’t bend to Trump’s will. I see Iran controlling four Arab capitals: Damascus, Sana, Baghdad and Beirut. I see Hamas still more interested in building tunnels in Gaza to kill Israelis than schools to strengthen Palestinian society. I see the crown prince of Saudi Arabia with one hand undertaking hugely important steps — moderating Saudi Islam, letting women drive and opening Saudi society culturally to the world — things we never imagined possible — and, with the other hand, abducting the prime minister of Lebanon, buying ridiculously expensive paintings and seizing businesses in the name of combating corruption — things we also never imagined possible. I see the Taliban killing 103 people in Kabul by packing an ambulance with explosives and driving it into a crowd. I see Houthis, Yemeni warlords, Iranians, Saudis and the U.A.E. all tearing Yemen apart in the name of God knows what. I see Turkey’s president silencing every critical journalist in his country. I see the Egyptian and Russian presidents eliminating all serious rivals in their upcoming elections. I see Bibi Netanyahu trying to derail a corruption investigation by weakening Israel’s justice system, free media and civil society — just like Trump and for the same purposes: to weaken constraints on his arbitrary use of political power. I see an American president threatening to tear up, or actually tearing up, global agreements he doesn’t like — the Iran nuclear deal, Nafta, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the Paris climate accord and aid to Palestinians and Pakistanis — but without any clear plan or alternative for the morning after that will improve on the status quo. Worst of all, I see an America — the world’s strongest guardian of truth, science and democratic norms — now led by a serial liar and norms destroyer, giving license to everyone else to ask, why can’t I? Can anything stop this epidemic of going all the way? Yes: Mother Nature, human nature and markets. They’ll all push back when no one else will. How so? Well, look at Gaza. Due largely to Hamas’s malevolence and incompetence, but also some Israeli restrictions, Gaza has limited hours of electricity each day. Result: Gaza’s already inadequate sewage plants are often offline, and waste goes untreated straight into the Mediterranean. Then the prevailing current washes Gaza’s poop north, where it clogs Israel’s big desalination plant in Ashkelon — which provides 15 percent of Israel’s drinking water, explains EcoPeace Middle East , the environmental NGO. In both 2016 and 2017, the Ashkelon plant had to close to clean Gaza’s crud out of its filters. It’s Mother Nature’s way of reminding both that if they try to go all the way, if they shun a healthy interdependence, she’ll poison them both. Iran’s military boss, Qasem Suleimani, thinks he’s a big man on campus. His proxies control four Arab capitals. All bow down. But then out of nowhere Iranians back home start protesting against Suleimani’s overreach; they’re tired of seeing their money spent on Gaza and Syria — not on Iranians. And, just as suddenly, the biggest internet meme in Iran becomes an Iranian woman ripping off her veil and holding it up on the end of a stick. And if you don’t think markets have a way of curing excesses, you didn’t read the top story in The Times. So to all of you going all the way, I say: Watch out for the market, Mother Nature and human nature. Because, noted Israeli political theorist Yaron Ezrahi, the first two are “uncontrollable and the other is irrepressible.” One is the relentless product of chemistry, biology and physics; one is the balance between greed and fear; and the third is the eternal human quest for freedom and dignity. In the end, they’ll shape the future more than any leader or party who tries going all the way.  Advertisement"
"Jeb Bush on the Issues","Advertisement Supported by By  Gerry Mullany Jeb Bush, who was governor of Florida from 1999 to 2007, on Monday announced his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination. A son of George Bush, the 41st president, and a younger brother of George W. Bush, the 43rd, he is known for sometimes bucking Republican orthodoxy. Here is a look at his stand on important issues. Mr. Bush says that American combat forces should not be sent to Iraq to fight the group calling itself the Islamic State, but that some troops should be embedded with Iraqi forces there “to help train them, to identify targets.” He has called the Obama administration’s framework of an agreement with Iran to curb its nuclear program a “horrific deal” and, like fellow Republican contenders, said he would most likely cancel any final agreement reached by the administration should he become president. Mr. Bush calls himself “an unwavering supporter” of Israel and its prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and distanced himself from recent comments by an adviser, former Secretary of State James A. Baker III, that were critical of Mr. Netanyahu. Mr. Bush opposes normalizing relations with Cuba; in early December, before President Obama moved to do so, Mr. Bush said that “instead of lifting the embargo, we should consider strengthening it.” Mr. Bush says he believes that people who are in this country illegally should be offered a path to legal status. “You pay your fines, you get provisional work permits, where you come out of the shadows, you pay taxes, you pay fines, you don’t receive government assistance, you learn English, you don’t commit crimes,” he said in February. “Any of those things that you do would be a deportable offense.” He also called, as many Republican candidates have, for tougher enforcement of immigration laws, including prosecuting businesses that hire undocumented aliens. Signaling his opposition to same-sex marriage, Mr. Bush says he believes in “traditional marriage.” But he has also suggested an openness to some form of recognition of same-sex unions. “I hope that we can show respect for the good people on all sides of the gay and lesbian marriage issue,” he said in January, “including couples making lifetime commitments to each other who are seeking greater legal protections and those of us who believe marriage is a sacrament and want to safeguard religious liberty.” “The climate is changing, and I’m concerned about that,” Mr. Bush said in New Hampshire in April, adding that “we need to work with the rest of the world to negotiate a way to reduce carbon emissions.” Those remarks distinguished him from most other Republican presidential hopefuls, who deny that the climate is changing or that global warming is caused by human behavior. But Mr. Bush also said he was more concerned about protecting the economy, warning of “the hollowing out of our industrial core, the hollowing out of our ability to compete in an increasingly competitive world.” Mr. Bush has been an outspoken defender of the Common Core national educational standards, which were intended to raise proficiency in math and English but have generated a strong backlash among conservatives who see Common Core as an overreach by the federal government. “Raising expectations and having accurate assessments of where kids are is essential for success,” Mr. Bush said in defending the standards. While focusing his economic message on inequality and middle-class wage stagnation, Mr. Bush has not yet offered detailed proposals to confront these issues. He has said he would try to nearly double the nation’s annual growth rate to 4 percent to create jobs. Though he favors simplifying the tax code, he has not specified how he would change the federal tax system. As governor, though, he signed several tax cuts into law, including a cut and then a repeal of Florida’s 0.2 percent tax on stocks, bonds and other so-called intangible assets. Advertisement"
"After Much Rancor, Obama and Netanyahu Meet, Probably for Last Time","Advertisement Supported by By  Mark Landler UNITED NATIONS — For seven years, they slogged through the sour rituals of a broken relationship: the strained meetings; the angry phone calls; the bitter recriminations; the slights, real and perceived. On Wednesday, President Obama and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met here for what is likely to be their last time as leaders of Israel and the United States. Their smiles said more than their words. “I want you to know, Barack, that you’ll always be a welcome guest in Israel,” Mr. Netanyahu said, noting there was a golf course next to his home for an ex-president reputed to have a “terrific” game. “We’ll set up a tee time,” Mr. Obama replied. It won’t be for the two of them, of course, since Mr. Netanyahu also noted he did not play golf. “I guarantee you, I will visit Israel often,” said Mr. Obama, who traveled to the country once as president. For all the bitterness that has characterized their relationship, over issues from the Iran nuclear deal to the peace process, Mr. Obama and Mr. Netanyahu were able to end things on a harmonious note, at least publicly. After months of negotiations, the United States and Israel just signed a 10-year, $38 billion military aid package . Both held it up as proof of the enduring, unbreakable bond between the two countries. Mr. Obama said the aid package would give Israel the ability to defend itself at a perilous time in the Middle East. Mr. Netanyahu said the security and intelligence cooperation between Israel and the United States was broader and deeper than most people understood, and he thanked Mr. Obama for his role in furthering that. Military cooperation has been a lone, steady bright spot in this otherwise rocky relationship. And yet, neither man seemed keen to revisit old grievances. Mr. Netanyahu did not mention the Iran deal, which he tried to kill with thunderous speeches to the General Assembly and the United States Congress. Mr. Obama touched only gently on the growth of Jewish settlements in the West Bank, which he once demanded that Mr. Netanyahu halt completely as a way to restart negotiations with the Palestinians. Behind closed doors, there were signs of a more typical Obama-Netanyahu encounter. Mr. Obama, according to a briefing by senior American officials, raised deep concerns about the settlements as an obstacle to a two-state solution, and Mr. Netanyahu pushed back. It was not clear whether Mr. Obama offered the Israeli leader any hints about whether he planned to lay out parameters for a peace deal before he leaves office — something that White House officials do not rule out and that would rankle Mr. Netanyahu. “His test has always been, ‘Can I make a positive difference by engaging on the Israeli-Palestinian issue?’” Benjamin J. Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser, said on Tuesday. “We’ve tried multiple tactics, none of them have succeeded, given the fact that the parties themselves have been unable to come together.” Given the political dynamics on the ground, some analysts expressed doubt that Mr. Obama would ever conclude that he could make a positive difference. “His aides will say, ‘You should do this for your legacy,’ but they’ll have to make a compelling case,” said Robert Danin, a senior fellow for Middle East studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. “Obama will reply, ‘Why should I expend political capital on this?’” Still, there were good reasons for both men not to part on bad terms. With seven weeks to go before the American election, Mr. Obama does not want to hand Republicans an argument that he, and by extension, his former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, are anti-Israel. For his part, back home in Israel, Mr. Netanyahu has been selling the $38 billion military aid package as “the greatest accomplishment since sliced bread,” said Aaron David Miller, a vice president of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars . Another public split with Mr. Obama would undermine the prime minister’s case, even as his domestic critics argue that Israel would have gotten more had Mr. Netanyahu not been so abrasive toward the American president. At the same time, few Israel watchers believe that today’s harmony speaks to a late-in-the-day reconciliation. “They’ll both be relieved that they don’t have to meet each other again,” said Martin S. Indyk, the executive vice president of the Brookings Institution, who had his own run-ins with Mr. Netanyahu when he served as Middle East envoy for the Obama administration. “Both have come to believe that the other is out to screw them.” Even now, Mr. Indyk said, the Israeli leader fears that Mr. Obama will back a United Nations Security Council resolution setting out the framework for an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal as his last act of Middle East diplomacy. Mr. Obama, he said, suspects that Mr. Netanyahu will continue expanding West Bank settlements “just to spite him.” After appearing to throw his weight behind Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential election, Mr. Netanyahu has stayed studiously out of American domestic politics this time. That led to a striking contrast at this year’s General Assembly: while Egypt’s president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, held court with Mrs. Clinton and the Republican nominee, Donald J. Trump, Mr. Netanyahu met neither of them. Even the choice of venue for Mr. Netanyahu’s session with Mr. Obama — a hotel in Midtown Manhattan — seemed less political than their usual encounters in the Oval Office. Then again, the Oval Office would have been a reminder of all the bad times they shared. In May 2011, Mr. Netanyahu publicly rebuked Mr. Obama after he tried to revive the peace process. Sitting next to his host in front of the fireplace, Mr. Netanyahu said he had no plans to negotiate with a “government that is backed by the Palestinian version of Al Qaeda,” referring to Hamas. Mr. Obama’s chief of staff, Bill Daley, turned to Ronald Dermer, a Netanyahu aide who later became Israel’s ambassador to Washington, and asked him if his boss had a habit of going to people’s houses and lecturing them. Amid all the happy talk Wednesday, Mr. Obama could not resist a brief reference to those chillier days. “One thing I can say about Prime Minister Netanyahu,” the president said, “is he has always been candid with us.” Advertisement"
"For Obama and Netanyahu, a Final Clash After Years of Conflict","Advertisement Supported by By  Peter Baker JERUSALEM — When President Obama and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel met in September for the last time before Mr. Obama leaves office, the session was marked by forced smiles and strained jokes about playing golf in retirement, as if bygones were bygones after nearly eight years of clawing conflict. Of course it was never going to end that way. How could it? The narrative of the tense and tetchy relationship between liberal president and conservative prime minister instead reached a climax in a hyper-politicized showdown over war, peace, justice, security, human rights and, at last, the very meaning of international friendship. Mr. Obama’s decision on Friday not to block a United Nations Security Council resolution condemning Israeli settlements laid bare all the grievances the two men have nursed since shortly after they took office in 2009. For Mr. Netanyahu, it was the final betrayal by a president who was supposed to be an ally but never really was. For Mr. Obama, it was the inevitable result of Mr. Netanyahu’s own stubborn defiance of international concerns with his policies. The two sides did little to hide their mutual contempt. After talks led them to conclude that Mr. Obama would not veto the resolution, as presidents of both parties have done in the past, Israeli officials essentially washed their hands of the incumbent and contacted his successor in the wings. President-elect Donald J. Trump promptly put out a statement calling on Mr. Obama to veto the resolution. When that ultimately did not stop the Council from acting, Mr. Netanyahu’s team expressed blistering anger at Mr. Obama. An Israeli official, insisting on anonymity to maintain the veneer of diplomatic protocol, gave a statement to multiple reporters on Friday blasting Mr. Obama and his secretary of state, John Kerry , by name. “President Obama and Secretary Kerry are behind this shameful move against Israel at the U.N.,” the official said. “The U.S. administration secretly cooked up with the Palestinians an extreme anti-Israeli resolution behind Israel’s back which would be a tailwind for terror and boycotts and effectively make the Western Wall occupied Palestinian territory.” The White House bristled at the attack, denying that it was behind the resolution but defending the decision to abstain rather than veto it as consistent with longstanding, bipartisan American opposition to Israeli settlement construction as an obstacle to peace with the Palestinians. The Israeli statement was “full of inaccuracies and falsehoods,” Benjamin J. Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser to Mr. Obama, told reporters on a conference call. The president, he said, tried repeatedly to bring the rivals together at the negotiating table, only to see Israel continue building more housing in the occupied West Bank in a way that would make a peace agreement even harder to broker. “We tried everything,” Mr. Rhodes said. In effect, he added just after Friday’s United Nations vote, Mr. Netanyahu had it coming. “Prime Minister Netanyahu had the opportunity to pursue policies that would have led to a different outcome today,” he said. “Absent this acceleration of settlement activity, absent the type of rhetoric we’ve seen out of the current Israeli government, I think the United States likely would have taken a different view.” The clash just four weeks before Mr. Obama leaves office culminated a fractious eight years between the men. From the start, the two did not see eye to eye. Idealistic and perhaps overconfident, Mr. Obama arrived in the White House certain that he could be the president who would finally resolve the decades-old dispute between Israelis and Palestinians. But Mr. Netanyahu saw a naïf who failed to grasp the existential threat to Israel and who demanded more of his friends than his enemies. The relationship was marked by one conflict after another, a reflection of not just personal differences but deeply held and diverging policy objectives of the men and their countries. Mr. Obama’s demand that Israel suspend new settlements to enter negotiations infuriated Mr. Netanyahu. The announcement of new construction in East Jerusalem while Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was visiting infuriated Mr. Obama. Two major pushes for negotiations by Mr. Obama unraveled amid mistrust and animosity. The multinational deal masterminded by Mr. Obama to curb Iran ’s nuclear program in exchange for relief from international sanctions proved a breaking point. At first, Mr. Obama hid the secret talks with Iran from the Israelis. After the talks became public knowledge, Mr. Netanyahu flew to Washington to excoriate the effort in a joint meeting of Congress. But he could not stop it. The two tried to put the rupture behind them last fall by sealing a 10-year $38 billion American security aid package for Israel, but even then the bitterness of their quarrels hung over the agreement. Mr. Netanyahu’s critics at home asserted that the package should have been $45 billion and that the prime minister’s speech to Congress had come with a $7 billion price tag. American officials said it never would have been that high, but the opposing sides remained scratchy. Even after the smiles and golf get-together in New York in September, Mr. Obama made it clear that he was not yet done with his efforts to leave his mark on Middle East peace efforts as he considered outlining an American framework for an agreement. Mr. Obama was angered by Mr. Netanyahu’s proposal to save an illegal Israeli outpost in Amona by moving the settlers to another plot of land claimed by the Palestinians. Mr. Netanyahu’s critics in Israel said the Amona controversy and proposed legislation to legalize other outlaw outposts were responsible for Mr. Obama’s decision to abandon Israel’s government on Friday. “Netanyahu chose to advance the legalization bill, insisted on Amona and galloped into the wall in full knowledge that this would be the result — while choosing his personal interest over the national interest,” Tzipi Livni, a former foreign minister, wrote on Facebook. Mr. Netanyahu’s team rejected that. “I think the legalization bill had nothing to do with this,” said Michael Oren, a deputy minister and former ambassador to the United States, although he conceded that “it would have been good to discuss the legalization bill at a later time just because of questions like that.” Mr. Oren said the real obstacle to peace was Palestinian incitement, not Israeli settlements. The United Nations was hypocritical, he said, because it singled out Israel while ignoring scores of other territorial disputes around the world. “It’s not only an anti-Israel resolution but an anti-Semitic resolution,” he said. In the United States, Mr. Obama faced criticism not only from Republicans but from pro-Israel Democrats like Senator Chuck Schumer of New York and a cross section of Jewish-American organizations, including several that have been at odds with Mr. Trump. “It is deeply troubling that this biased resolution appears to be the final word of the administration on this issue,” Jonathan Greenblatt, chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, said in a statement. If it is the last word — and there are still 27 days left in the Obama presidency — it will serve as a coda to a relationship that never clicked. Advertisement"
"Global Network Expels as Many as 30 of Iran’s Banks in Move to Isolate Its Economy","Advertisement By RICK GLADSTONE and STEPHEN CASTLE MARCH 15, 2012  A global communication network vital to the banking industry announced on Thursday that it was expelling as many as 30 Iranian financial institutions — including the Central Bank — crippling their ability to conduct international business and further isolating the country from the world economy. The network, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication , or Swift, took the action to comply with European Union sanctions on Iranian banks, which were enacted in response to Iran ’s disputed nuclear energy program . It is the first time that Swift, a consortium based in Belgium and subject to European Union laws, has taken such a drastic step, which severs a crucial conduit for Iran to electronically repatriate billions of dollars’ worth of earnings from the sale of oil and other exports. Advocates of sanctions against Iran welcomed the action by Swift, which takes effect on Saturday, according to a statement on the network’s Web site . The statement said that Swift had been “instructed to discontinue its communications services to Iranian financial institutions that are subject to European sanctions.” Advertisement Lázaro Campos, Swift’s chief executive, said in the statement that “disconnecting banks is an extraordinary and unprecedented step for Swift. It is a direct result of international and multilateral action to intensify financial sanctions against Iran.” Advertisement There was no immediate reaction from Iran. But its leaders have consistently criticized the vise of economic sanctions on its financial and oil industries as illegal and as bullying by the Western powers. The United States and European Union have used the sanctions to pressure Iran to suspend its uranium enrichment activities, out of suspicion that it is surreptitiously trying to achieve the capability to make nuclear weapons . While Iran insists the uranium enrichment is for peaceful purposes, it agreed last week to a resumption of long-stalled negotiations to resolve the dispute. It had been conducting the talks with the five permanent members of the Security Council and Germany, but the negotiations were ended out of frustration with what the Western powers characterized as Iran’s pattern of insincerity and stalling. Supporters of the sanctions said Iran’s new willingness to talk was proof that the strategy could succeed — and in any case was preferable to military action to stop the nuclear program. Israel, which regards Iran as its most dangerous enemy, has threatened to attack suspected nuclear sites in Iran if it concludes that sanctions are not working. President Obama has counseled Israeli leaders to give the sanctions more time. The announcement by Swift came a day after Mr. Obama, meeting in Washington with Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain, warned Iran to negotiate in good faith at the talks, expected to take place in coming weeks. “The window for solving this issue diplomatically is shrinking,” Mr. Obama said. Even before the Swift announcement, Iran was confronting problems stemming from its regional banking partners’ anticipation of its troubles conducting financial transactions. Major foreign exchange houses in the United Arab Emirates have stopped handling the Iranian currency, the rial, over the last several weeks because of the risk, Reuters reported Thursday, quoting trading executives there, putting further pressure on the currency, which has declined by about 50 percent in the last year.

Swift’s announcement did not specify the number of expelled Iranian banks or mention them by name, and the European Union has not yet announced a formal list. But the European Union sanctions apply to the Central Bank of Iran and other major Iranian banks, including Bank Melli, Bank Mellat, Tejarat Bank, Bank Refah, Future Bank, Persia International Bank, Post Bank and Europäisch-Iranische Handelsbank. Up to 30 institutions could be affected. “It is a very efficient measure,” said a European Union official. “It can seriously cripple the banking sector of Iran.” The Swift network connects more than 10,000 financial institutions and corporations in 210 countries, allowing them to exchange automated financial information securely. According to Swift’s 2010 annual review , the latest available, 19 Iranian member banks and 25 financial institutions used the network more than 2 million times that year. Advertisement Swift’s decision is a turnabout from a month ago, when advocates of stronger sanctions in the United States were publicly pressuring it to expel Iranian banks, arguing that Swift was legally required to act in order to close a loophole that permitted sanctioned banks to evade penalty. Swift argued that it was already complying with the sanctions, but later said it was working with regulators in the European Union and United States “to find the right multilateral legal framework which will enable Swift to address the issues.” David S. Cohen, the Treasury Department’s under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, issued a statement praising Swift’s action, which he said “reinforces the isolation of designated Iranian banks from the international financial sector.” He said the United States would “continue to work closely with our European and other partners in the international community to increase further the pressure on Iran and to strengthen the impact of our sanctions.” Advocacy groups in the United States hailed the announcement. “This could deny Iran’s banks the ability to move billions of dollars, and ratchet up the economic pressure on leaders who have so far refused to reach a negotiated settlement on their illegal nuclear weapons program,” said Mark Dubowitz, executive director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies , a nonprofit group in Washington, who has advised the administration and Congress on the sanctions strategy. Mark D. Wallace, president of United Against Nuclear Iran , a group that advocates sanctions, called Swift’s action “a significant step in the right direction,” adding, “In order to implement the most robust sanctions in history, Iran should be cut off from the international banking system.” Rick Gladstone reported from New York, and Stephen Castle from Brussels.

"The Strange Persistence of Guilt","Advertisement Supported by By  David Brooks In 1981 the philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre opened his book “After Virtue” with a passage that is now famous. Imagine if we lost the theoretical coherence of science. Imagine if we still used scientific words like neutrino and atomic weight, but had no overall framework to explain how they fit together. That’s the state of our moral discourse today, he suggested. We still use words describing virtue and vice, but without any overall metaphysics. Religious frameworks no longer organize public debate. Secular philosophies that grew out of the Enlightenment have fallen apart. We have words and emotional instincts about what feels right and wrong, but no settled criteria to help us think, argue and decide. That diagnosis seemed accurate to many people, and it seemed to point toward a culture of easygoing relativism. With no common criteria by which to judge moral action we’d all become blandly nonjudgmental — sort of chill, pluralistic versions of Snoop Dogg: You do you and I’ll do me and we’ll all be cool about it. Whatever feels right. But that’s not what’s happened. We haven’t entered the age of milquetoast bourgeois relativism. Instead, society has become a free-form demolition derby of moral confrontation: the cold-eyed fanaticism of students at Middlebury College and other campuses nationwide; the rage of the alt-right; holy wars over transgender bathrooms; the furious intensity at every town-hall meeting on every subject. American life has secularized and grand political ideologies have fallen away, but moral conflict has only grown. In fact, it’s the people who go to church least — like the members of the alt-right — who seem the most fervent moral crusaders. We’re living in an age of great moral pressure, even if we lack the words to articulate it. In fact, as Wilfred McClay points out in a brilliant essay called “ The Strange Persistence of Guilt ” for The Hedgehog Review, religion may be in retreat, but guilt seems as powerfully present as ever. Technology gives us power and power entails responsibility, and responsibility, McClay notes, leads to guilt: You and I see a picture of a starving child in Sudan and we know inwardly that we’re not doing enough. “Whatever donation I make to a charitable organization, it can never be as much as I could have given. I can never diminish my carbon footprint enough, or give to the poor enough. … Colonialism, slavery, structural poverty, water pollution, deforestation — there’s an endless list of items for which you and I can take the rap.” McClay is describing a world in which we’re still driven by an inextinguishable need to feel morally justified. Our thinking is still vestigially shaped by religious categories. And yet we have no clear framework or set of rituals to guide us in our quest for goodness. Worse, people have a sense of guilt and sin, but no longer a sense that they live in a loving universe marked by divine mercy, grace and forgiveness. There is sin but no formula for redemption. The only reliable way to feel morally justified in that culture is to assume the role of victim. As McClay puts it, “Claiming victim status is the sole sure means left of absolving oneself and securing one’s sense of fundamental moral innocence.” “If one wishes to be accounted innocent, one must find a way to make the claim that one cannot be held morally responsible. This is precisely what the status of victimhood accomplishes.” I’d add that this move takes all moral striving and it politicizes it. Instead of seeing moral struggle as something between you and God (the religious version) or as something that happens between the good and evil within yourself (the classical version), moral struggle now happens primarily between groups. We see events through the lens of moral Marxism, as a class or ethnic struggle between the evil oppressor and the supposedly innocent oppressed. The moral narrative of colonialism is applied to every situation. The concept of inherited sin is back in common currency, only these days we call it “privilege.” As the political scientist Thomas U. Berger put it, “We live in an age of apology and recrimination.” The conflicts on campus take on a Salem witch trial intensity. In the Middle East, the Israelis and the Palestinians compete for the victimhood narrative. Even America’s heartland populists see themselves as the victims of the oppressive coastal elites. Steve Bannon is the Frantz Fanon of the whites. Sin is a stain, a weight and a debt. But at least religions offer people a path from self-reflection and confession to atonement and absolution. Mainstream culture has no clear path upward from guilt, either for individuals or groups. So you get a buildup of scapegoating, shaming and Manichaean condemnation. “This is surely a moral crisis in the making,” McClay writes. I notice some schools and prisons have restorative justice programs to welcome offenders back into the community. They tend to be more substantive than the cheap grace of instant forgiveness. I wonder if the wider society needs procedures like that, so the private guilt everybody feels isn’t transmuted into a public state of perpetual moral war. Advertisement"
"North Koreans Agree to Disable Nuclear Facilities","Advertisement By HELENE COOPER OCT. 4, 2007  WASHINGTON, Oct. 3 — North Korea has agreed to disable all of its nuclear facilities by the end of the year, in a move that the Bush administration hailed as a diplomatic victory that could serve as a model for how to deal with Iran, which has defied American efforts to rein in its nuclear ambitions. The North Korea agreement, announced in Beijing on Wednesday, sets out the first specific timetable for the North  to disclose all its nuclear programs and disable all facilities in return for 950,000 metric tons of fuel oil or its equivalent in economic aid. The accord is the second stage of a six-nation pact reached in February, one that has continued to draw sharp criticism from conservatives who complain that the United States is rewarding North Korea for its test of a nuclear device last October. The agreement has not yet resolved the contentious question of when North Korea will give up its nuclear weapons. The agreement calls on the United States to “begin the process of removing” North Korea from a United States terrorism list “in parallel” with the North’s  actions. Conservative critics said the United States should not take North Korea off the terrorism list until it gave up all its nuclear weapons, and argued that the pact was far too conciliatory toward a nuclear power with alleged ties to international terrorism. Advertisement But the Bush administration has been eager to show diplomatic progress, and President Bush suggested that the deal should serve as an example to Iran, which has refused to suspend its uranium enrichment program. During a town hall meeting on Wednesday in Lancaster, Pa., Mr. Bush told a questioner that he might hold direct talks with Iran if it first froze enrichment of uranium. Advertisement “If your question is, ‘Will you ever sit down with them,’ we’ve proven we would with North Korea, and the answer is, ‘Yeah, just so long as we can achieve something, so long as we are able to get our objective,’” Mr. Bush said. John R. Bolton, the administration’s former ambassador to the United Nations, said the White House violated the original purpose of the diplomatic talks by agreeing to negotiate side agreements with North Korea about taking it off both the terrorism list and a second list of “enemy” nations forbidden from trading with the United States. “If they come off either or both lists, without any final verification of their performance on the nuclear issue, I think the president will have embarrassed his administration in history,” Mr. Bolton said. Critics of the White House, including some Democrats, note that the February accord bears a strong resemblance to the 1994 agreement between North Korea and the Clinton administration, one that Bush administration officials denounced in the past as a giveaway, and which fell apart in 2002. Conservatives are also angry that the United States went ahead with the agreement despite a recent Israeli airstrike in Syria that Israeli officials have said was directed at nuclear material supplied by North Korea. During meetings this past weekend, Christopher R. Hill, the chief United States negotiator, told North Korea that one of the things it must disclose were details of whatever nuclear material it had been supplying to Syria, two senior Bush administration officials said. Both officials, who asked that their names not be used because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the issue, said that North Korean officials denied giving Syria any assistance. “We did not achieve clarity on this issue, but that does not mean we do not intend to keep trying,” one of the officials said. “We aren’t operating on faith.” Advertisement On Monday, the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad,  acknowledged for the first time that the Israeli incursion had been an attack, but said the target had been an empty warehouse. “They bombed a building, a construction, it’s related to the military but it’s not used,” Mr. Assad told the British Broadcasting Corporation.

Under the agreement reached in February, North Korea has shut down its Yongbyon nuclear plant, which, according to American intelligence estimates, has produced enough plutonium for as many as a half-dozen bombs. This week’s agreement calls on the North to disable Yongbyon by the end of the year. Administration officials said they hoped that by disabling the facility, they would avoid a repeat of 2002, when North Korea shut down Yongbyon and then restarted the plant after talks broke down. “They were able to get the reactor up and running in two months,” a State Department official said. “By focusing on disablement, the hope is that the next interim measure is to do things to it so it can’t readily be turned back on.” The agreement on Wednesday is part of a larger pact between North Korea, China, Russia, South Korea, Japan and the United States — the so-called six parties that have been wrangling to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula. Mr. Hill, the chief American negotiator, said the pact also called for the United States to give North Korea assistance with its energy sector. State Department officials said the first $25 million, equivalent to 50,000 tons of fuel aid, would be making its way to North Korea shortly. Mr. Hill said North Korea did not have enough room in its ports or oil depots to put up all of the fuel oil it had been promised, which was part of the reason why the countries would also give the North equivalent economic aid to help to build and improve energy plants and storage depots. The official joint statement is carefully worded on how or when North Korea will be taken off the terrorism list, reflecting the political delicacy, particularly in the United States, of the matter. In Washington, Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, said North Korea should remain on the list. “In 2005, we wrote a law specifically aimed at closing the door on the possibility of civilian nuclear cooperation between the U.S. and North Korea,” Mr. Markey said in a statement. “Given North Korea’s dangerous record of developing nuclear weapons, exporting advanced missile technology, engaging in international criminal activity, and engaging in international terrorism, that prohibition is just as necessary today as it was two years ago when the president signed it into law.” Steven Lee Myers and Mark Mazzetti contributed reporting.

"Seeing nuclear weapons from North Korea’s perspective","Letters  Mon 4 Sep 2017 19.19 BST   Last modified on Fri 9 Feb 2018 18.37 GMT   Your second leader ( A nuclear armed rogue state is bad but war would be worse , 4 September) states: “It is in the nature of paranoid autocrats like the Kim dynasty never to be satisfied with the security they have.” But if we look at the nuclear arsenals of the western powers from Kim’s point of view, his paranoia begins to look more like a rational response: what is good for the west’s security must also be good for North Korea’s. On 7 July, 122 nations endorsed a United Nations treaty to ban all nuclear weapons. The nuclear-armed states boycotted the entire proceedings. How might Kim have reacted if instead they had been there and signed up? Caroline Westgate Hexham, Northumberland • As you say: “To talk of nuclear weapons in rational terms ... is always slightly misleading.” The UK is supremely unqualified to teach a lesson in rationality to North Korea, since successive British governments have for decades been afflicted with exactly the same delusion as Kim Jong-un . He may think the rest of the world is in awe of his weaponry, whereas in fact his posture is regarded as ridiculous. Viewed from other countries the UK’s sense of its importance in depending on nuclear arms is equally ridiculous. What would impress the rest of the world would be our voluntarily scrapping them. Anthony Matthew Leicester • We’ve heard President Trump’s announcements that “the time for talks is over, they do not work”. Actually, history says they have worked several times. The first occurred in 1992, when the North and South signed the declaration of denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. This included a joint inspection agency, like ABACC for Argentina and Brazil, to inspect nuclear facilities in both countries. The second was the agreed framework of 1994 that resulted in a cessation of North Korea’s nuclear programmes in exchange for the US’s agreement to build two PWR nuclear reactors. This lasted until 2002, when claims of faults by both sides brought its end. Next there were a series of six-party talks in Beijing, beginning in 2003, that produced an agreement to abandon all North Korean nuclear weapons programmes and return to the non-proliferation treay. A young physicist in my group at Los Alamos was a technical adviser to these talks. I believe the failures of these actions were partially due to US demands to deal with other activities it did not like. The success of the recent Iran nuclear talks is partly because the negotiating states dealt with Iran’s nuclear programme alone, without attaching other points such as Iran’s support of Hezbollah. Dr Douglas Reilly Los Alamos, New Mexico, USA •  What hasn’t been discussed is how British nuclear designs have been purloined by North Korea to build production plants for its nuclear explosives. There is evidence that the British Magnox nuclear plant design – which was primarily built as a military plutonium production factory – provided the blueprint for the North Korean military plutonium programme based in Yongbyon. Here is what Douglas (now Lord) Hogg, then a Conservative minister, admitted in a parliamentary reply in 1994: “North Korea possesses a graphite moderated reactor which, while much smaller, has generic similarities to the reactors operated by British Nuclear Fuels plc. However, design information of these British reactors is not classified and has appeared in technical journals” (Hansard, 25 May 1994). The uranium enrichment programmes of both North Korea and Iran also have a UK connection. The blueprints of this type of plant were stolen by a Pakistani scientist, AQ Khan, from the Urenco enrichment plant in the Netherlands in the early 1970s, according to US researcher David Albright. This plant was – and remains – one-third owned by the UK government. The Pakistan government subsequently sold the technology to Iran, which later exchanged it for North Korean Nodong missiles. A technical delegation from the AQ Khan Research Labs reportedly visited the secret enrichment plant in the summer of 1996. Hwang Jang-yop, a former aid to former president Kim Il-sung (the grandfather of the current North Korean president) who defected in 1997, revealed details to Western intelligence investigators, according to Deception: Pakistan, the United States, and the Global Weapons Conspiracy (2007). History tells us the globalisation of nuclear energy has been a reckless mistake. Dr David Lowry Former director, European Proliferation Information Centre • A letter last week ( Letters , 1 September) called on the UK to join the UN treaty banning nuclear weapons and pursue a leadership role to enhance security in the world. Unfortunately, there is no chance that the UK would unilaterally give up Trident. On the other hand, giving up Trident as part of a global treaty joined by all the nuclear states is not only feasible, but is a requirement of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. I wrote to the prime minister and asked her to reconsider the government’s position on the UN treaty. Her defence secretary, Michael Fallon, answered by saying that the treaty risks undermining and weakening the NPT. This hypocrisy undermines the truth. The NPT came into force in 1970 and requires the nuclear states to pursue negotiations on a treaty to ban nuclear weapons at an early date. After nearly 50 years the nuclear states are clearly in breach of this legal obligation. Theresa May recently condemned North Korea for acting illegally. She was right to do so but we should not forget that she was a pot calling the kettle black. Jim Pragnell Otford, Kent"
"Saudis eye Iran and ignore Trump's temperament as red carpet rolled out","Riyadh believes Trump will prove a more natural ally after eight years of strained ties with Obama – and is hopeful of signing massive weapons deal  Martin Chulov in Riyadh  Fri 19 May 2017 12.02 BST   First published on Fri 19 May 2017 07.30 BST   Saudi Arabia has prepared a spectacular – if wary – welcome for Donald Trump , ignoring mounting concerns about his temperament and insisting that his visit on Saturday will reconfirm the Kingdom’s status as a regional force. Gleeful officials say the US president’s decision to make Riyadh the first stop in his first foreign trip in office sends a powerful message underlining Saudi Arabia’s clout after eight years of strained bilateral ties under Barack Obama. Besieged by scandal at home , Trump heads abroad with an ambitious agenda that aims to stake his claim as a global leader , first by delivering a speech on Islam in the religion’s birthplace, and then moving on to Jerusalem and Rome – epicentres of the world’s two other main monotheistic religions – before concluding his trip at Nato and G7 summits. Leaders in Riyadh also believe that Trump will sign on to one of the biggest weapons deals in history and unveil plans to form and back an ‘Arab Nato’ – drastically emboldening a US-led pact that had underwritten the regional security order until early in the Obama administration. The Saudi leadership has bought into a central theme of Trump’s planned speech – confronting extremist ideology – claiming that emboldened bilateral ties will help it rein in ultra-conservative wahhabi thought that governs life in the Kingdom – and which clerics have been widely accused of exporting elsewhere in the Islamic world. The most anticipated address of Trump’s chaotic six months in office is aimed at marking a reset with Muslim states, which were unsettled by his public statements on Islam throughout the presidential campaign but have been since the inauguration found some reassurance in his administration’s combative stance towards Iran. “Iran is the grand prize here,” said one member of the Saudi royal family, who declined to be named. “Everything else is bells and whistles.” The Kingdom’s deputy crown prince and defence minister, Mohammad bin Salman has used the Trump visit to amplify his wide-reaching reform program, which includes an overhaul of a bloated public sector, and hopes to encourage more openness through entertainment and cultural exchanges. Such concerns may not be completely laid to rest by a men-only concert after Trump’s speech by the country star Toby Keith – known for such hits as I Like Girls that Drink Beer and The Angry American. Saudi officials also appear to have conditioned their moves against extremist wahhabism on US support for their agenda on reforms and Iran. “The war against extremism is a centrepiece of that,” said the royal family member. They’re in part saying to Trump: ‘We’ll do you a deal.’” Saudi and US flags are already fluttering along streets in Riyadh’s central business district. Trump’s domestic travails, and his colourful past as a businessman and television personality, are well known across the capital. There remains deep scepticism about his reasons for visiting, but also a recognition that his past as a dealmaker may prove useful. “Does he get Iran? No, but his advisers do,” said Khaled Salman, a finance broker. “And so do the hosts on his next stop.” Before Trump travels to Jerusalem on Monday, he will be a guest alongside 50 Arab and Muslim leaders at a banquet that Saudi leader King Salman says will “forge a new partnership”. The central plank of those closer relations is opposition to Iran , whose leaders Mohammad bin Salman recently accused of trying to “control the Islamic world”. Trump has attempted to dismantle Obama’s agenda at home and abroad, whittling away at healthcare reforms, climate change and long established trade arrangements. But he appears especially enthusiastic to overturn the Obama-led rapprochement with Iran, which culminated in a historic nuclear deal aimed at enticing the country to stop its nuclear program in return for a gradual lifting of crippling sanctions. Moving away from detente with Iran and making a high-profile visit to Saudi Arabia restores a default position that for most of the past four decades had seen the US ally with Saudi Arabia and the Gulf countries as a bulwark against Tehran. Trump is also likely to lobby Saudi leaders to form closer ties with Israel, arguing that all three states share a common foe. Sporadic ties between Riyadh and Tel Aviv have existed since the mid-70s, but have become more frequent over the past 15 years, during which both countries became convinced that Iran was building a secret nuclear weapons program. Saudi Arabia, too, is determined to mark a reset after years of increasing bitterness towards Obama. When Trump’s predecessor visited Riyadh last year, he was snubbed by the King and greeted at the airport by the governor of Riyadh . Trump’s planned welcome could not be more contrasting. “It’s a little bit personal for King Salman,” said one Saudi newspaper columnist who said he had been forbidden from giving interviews. “He doesn’t care if Obama wriggles as he writes his memoirs, but doesn’t expect him to either. He made it very clear that he thought Iran were the good guys and we were the villains.” The perception that Saudi Arabia had facilitated the rise of extremist groups was widespread among senior Obama officials, who viewed some Saudi leaders suspiciously and claimed that proselytising by senior clerics and some officials had had spread rigid wahhabi thought into Islamic countries it had regarded as “moderate”. The new administration has eschewed such comments, but Trump himself has claimed that “Islam hates us”, attempted to bring in a travel ban targeting six Muslim-majority countries and has hinted at immigration policies that make it more difficult for muslims to live and work in the US. His stance towards an Arab Nato will be closely studied by Riyadh, which has suggested the idea for many years within the framework of standing arrangements – that the US offer leadership and financial support. Trump has so far favoured bilateral models that shift the burden of payment to allies. But his reluctance to write cheques may be tempered by the suggested size of the arms deal: up to $100bn in new weapons to the Saudi military, much of which will be diverted to the ongoing, contentious, war in Yemen that has pitched Saudi forces against Houthi rebels, which Riyadh claims are directed by Iran."
"As Trump Threatens Car Tariffs, Europe Prepares to Strike Back","Advertisement Supported by By  Alan Rappeport and Jack Ewing WASHINGTON — Europe’s top trade diplomat is bracing for a trade war with the United States and said on Wednesday that the European Union was preparing to strike back if President Trump followed through with his threat to impose tariffs on Europe’s cars. The European Union and the United States are meeting this week to try to lay the foundation for trade talks that would reduce tariffs on a range of industrial goods. But as Mr. Trump and members of his administration vent about the pace of negotiations and continue dangling potential auto tariffs, the Europeans have begun drawing up a list of American products they would tax if the trade dispute escalates. “We have already suffered from the tariffs on steel and aluminum, and we think that they are deeply unjustified,” Cecilia Malmstrom, the European Union trade commissioner, told reporters in Washington on Wednesday. Europe has already challenged the United States at the World Trade Organization over its imposition of 10 percent tariffs on aluminum and 25 percent on steel and has retaliated with tariffs on American goods like peanut butter, whiskey and orange juice. “We would do the same were we to be targets of tariffs on cars and car parts,” Ms. Malmstrom said. Ms. Malmstrom said that she had prepared a draft list of American sectors that could face retaliation but that they needed to be approved by member states of the European Union. While she would not detail the products, she said that Europe could retaliate against a range of American goods, including autos and agriculture, and that the response would be fully compatible with World Trade Organization rules. Still, she said, the aim is to resolve the trade differences before tensions escalate further. “We think there is much more to gain from having a positive agenda jointly,” Ms. Malmstrom said. The remarks came after Ms. Malmstrom met with Robert E. Lighthizer, Mr. Trump’s top trade negotiator, to chart a path forward for negotiations. She described the discussions as productive, but expressed frustration about the lack of progress in getting the steel and aluminum tariffs lifted. The steel tariffs and the fallout from Mr. Trump’s trade war with China have begun to have serious consequences for European growth. Germany’s official statistics office said Wednesday that the country’s economy shrank 0.2 percent in the third quarter of 2018 compared with the previous quarter, the first decline since 2015. One factor was a drop in German exports to China, where the economy has slowed in part because of American tariffs on Chinese goods. BMW, the German automaker, said last week that the trade war had so far cost the company nearly 300 million euros, or about $337 million, and that it might have to move some production from Spartanburg, S.C., to China to avoid retaliatory tariffs. The United States and Europe called a trade cease-fire last summer after Mr. Trump and the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, agreed that there would be no additional tariffs imposed as they embarked on trans-Atlantic trade talks. Ms. Malmstrom said that Europe was under the assumption that it would not face car tariffs while talks proceed but acknowledged on Wednesday that she had not received any assurances about such an exemption. Congress must grant the Trump administration “fast track” authority to formally begin talks with Europe and the 28 European Union member states must also agree to a framework before talks can begin in earnest. That process could take a year. Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, warned on a trip to Europe last month that “the president’s patience is not unlimited” and lamented the lack of progress. However, on Wednesday, Ms. Malmstrom blamed the glacial pace of America’s legislative system for inhibiting negotiations. There is already disagreement on the scope of the talks and whether the negotiations will include agricultural products. The Trump administration has been pushing for greater access to Europe’s agricultural market — including selling more chicken, soy and dairy products. European officials say agricultural products are a no-go area, except for soybeans, while American officials want to break down barriers that make it difficult for farmers to sell beef and cheese in Europe. Expectations were low in Brussels on Wednesday that the talks in Washington would lead to a reduction in tensions that have begun to inflict tangible damage to the European economy. European leaders view Mr. Trump’s threat to impose tariffs on their auto exports as a nuclear option that would force them to break off talks and impose a new round of retaliatory measures. Shocked and surprised when Mr. Trump imposed tariffs this year on European steel and aluminum, they are still struggling to cope with his use of brinkmanship to negotiate with a longtime ally. American officials, by contrast, believe that the steel tariffs successfully forced Europe to the bargaining table and Mr. Trump has repeatedly cited the threat of auto tariffs as the final nudge needed to get Mr. Juncker to agree to trade talks. Mr. Trump convened his trade advisers at the White House on Tuesday to discuss a Commerce Department investigation into whether the auto tariffs pose a threat to national security — a precursor to imposing tariffs. For now, however, Mr. Trump has decided to hold off on moving ahead with them. But the president has not been shy about making known his frustrations with Europe. In a Twitter post on Tuesday morning , Mr. Trump criticized France for making it hard for American winemakers to sell their products there and said, “Not fair, must change!” Such sentiments offer a taste of why a comprehensive trade agreement with Europe could be difficult. Armed with statistics on wine tariffs, Ms. Malmstrom noted that there was a minimal difference in the import taxes that the United States charged on foreign wine and what Europe charged. “In practical terms, it’s not really correct to say that,” Ms. Malmstrom said of Mr. Trump’s assertion. “We are happy to buy the American wine, and I think many Americans are happy to buy European wine as well. The costs are more or less the same when it comes to tariffs.” Alan Rappeport reported from Washington, and Jack Ewing from Brussels. Advertisement"
"Theresa May speaks out against Trump climate change stance at UN","PM ranks US plan to withdraw from Paris treaty alongside North Korean nuclear tests as threat to global security  Heather Stewart Political editor  Wed 20 Sep 2017 23.57 BST   First published on Wed 20 Sep 2017 20.01 BST   Theresa May has issued a veiled warning to Donald Trump , arguing that his plan to withdraw from the Paris climate change treaty ranks alongside North Korea’s nuclear missile tests as a threat to global prosperity and security. In a speech to the United Nations general assembly, the prime minister, whose authority at home has been severely tested since June’s general election result, sought to project her vision of a “rules-based” international order. She said global cooperation was the only way to confront shared international challenges, including terrorism, climate change, and mass movements of refugees – and condemned countries that fail to play by the rules. The prime minister did not name the US president directly but made clear that she believed ongoing membership of the Paris climate change accord was as important as the nuclear non-proliferation treaty in maintaining global security. “As the global system struggles to adapt, we are confronted by states deliberately flouting – for their own gain – the rules and standards that have secured our collective prosperity and security,” she said. She singled out Russia, Syria and North Korea for direct condemnation, but described the climate change treaty as part of the “rules-based system” that protects global peace and security. “It is the fundamental values that we share, values of fairness, justice and human rights, that have created the common cause between nations to act together in our shared interest and form the multilateral system. “And it is this rules-based system which we have developed – including the institutions, the international frameworks of free and fair trade, agreements such as the Paris climate change accord, and laws and conventions like the non-proliferation treaty – which enables the global co-operation through which we can protect those values.” She warned that undermining these international institutions, including the UN, ultimately threatened states’ national interests. “If this system we have created is found no longer to be capable of meeting the challenges of our time, then there will be a crisis of faith in multilateralism and global cooperation that will damage the interests of all our peoples.” The prime minister was the first world leader to visit Trump in the White House , brushing off concerns in some European capitals about his unpredictability. But she has repeatedly expressed concern about his decision to seek to renegotiate the Paris treaty, and a planned state visit to the UK has been indefinitely postponed, amid fears of public protests. She delivered the speech just an hour before she was due to meet Trump for a bilateral meeting in a New York hotel. In his own speech to the UN general assembly on Tuesday, the US president described the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, as “rocket man”, and threatened to “totally destroy” Kim’s country if it did not rein in its nuclear ambitions. May issued her own strongly worded condemnation of North Korea’s actions, but stopped short of threatening military action. “Time after time he has shown contempt for the international community of law-abiding states,” she said of Kim Jong-un. “Contempt for his neighbours. And contempt for the institutions and rules that have preserved peace and security. “On this challenge the UN has in recent weeks shown it can step up to the task, with last Monday’s security council resolution creating the biggest sanctions package of the 21st century. We have seen regional and global powers coming together and – as in its founding charter – putting aside limited self-interest to show leadership on behalf of the wider world.” She also criticised Russia for using its veto on the UN security council to block tougher action against Syria for using chemical weapons on civilians. “One country in particular has used its veto as many times in the last five years as in the whole of the second half of the cold war. And in so doing they have prevented action against a despicable regime that has murdered its own people with chemical weapons,” she said. May was applauded when she recounted the terrorist attacks in London and Manchester earlier this year, and said: “The terrorists did not win, for we will never let anyone destroy our way of life.” The prime minister’s trip to New York has been overshadowed by speculation about Boris Johnson’s future , after the foreign secretary wrote a 4,000-word article for the Daily Telegraph that appeared to set out a distinctive vision for Brexit. But on Wednesday night her spokesman said Johnson had changed plans and would fly back to London alongside May on the prime minister’s RAF ­Voyager jet to attend a specially convened meeting of the ­cabinet, where she hopes her colleagues will back her on Brexit. Her UN address, delivered as she prepares for a major speech on Brexit in Florence on Friday, was aimed at presenting Britain as a free-trading, outward-looking country that would continue to play its role in the world. May also urged the UN to reform, and repeated a pledge by her international development secretary, Priti Patel, that Britain would withhold up to 30% of its £90m a year core funding to the UN, unless it could meet performance targets showing that it was delivering value for money. “Throughout its history the UN has suffered from a seemingly unbridgeable gap between the nobility of its purposes and the effectiveness of its delivery,” May said. “When the need for multilateral action has never been greater, the shortcomings of the UN and its institutions risk undermining the confidence of states as members and donors. “Even more importantly, they risk the confidence and faith of those who rely upon the blue helmets; who rely upon that sign I stand in front of today coming to their aid in the darkest of hours.” After delivering her speech, May went straight to the bilateral meeting with Trump, at the Lotte New York Palace hotel. Seated in front of US and UK flags, Trump said: “We will be doing a lot of trading with the UK and we look forward to it.” May said: “We’ve had many discussions between our representatives and ourselves on a whole variety of issues – including trade, which is important for us, and some other policy issues – and our security and defence relationship, which of course is the closest we have.” The prime minister used the meeting as an opportunity to lobby Trump over the importance of preserving jobs at aerospace giant Bombardier in Northern Ireland , and to press the president over the importance of the international nuclear deal with Iran, which he has threatened to tear up."
"U.S. and Russia Reach Deal to Destroy Syria’s Chemical Arms","Advertisement Supported by By  Michael R. Gordon GENEVA — The United States and Russia reached a sweeping agreement on Saturday that called for Syria’s arsenal of chemical weapons to be removed or destroyed by the middle of 2014 and indefinitely stalled the prospect of American airstrikes. The joint announcement, on the third day of intensive talks in Geneva, also set the stage for one of the most challenging undertakings in the history of arms control. “This situation has no precedent,” said Amy E. Smithson, an expert on chemical weapons at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies . “They are cramming what would probably be five or six years’ worth of work into a period of several months, and they are undertaking this in an extremely difficult security environment due to the ongoing civil war.” Although the agreement explicitly includes the United Nations Security Council for the first time in determining possible international action in Syria, Russia has maintained its opposition to any military action. But George Little, the Pentagon press secretary, emphasized that the possibility of unilateral American military force was still on the table. “We haven’t made any changes to our force posture to this point,” Mr. Little said. “The credible threat of military force has been key to driving diplomatic progress, and it’s important that the Assad regime lives up to its obligations under the framework agreement.” In Syria, the state news agency, SANA, voiced cautious approval of the Russian and American deal, calling it “a starting point,” though the government issued no immediate statement about its willingness to implement the agreement. In any case, the deal was at least a temporary reprieve for President Bashar al-Assad and his Syrian government, and it formally placed international decision-making about Syria into the purview of Russia, one of Mr. Assad’s staunchest supporters and military suppliers. That reality was bitterly seized on by the fractured Syrian rebel forces, most of which have pleaded for American airstrikes. Gen. Salim Idris, the head of the Western-backed rebels’ nominal military command, the Supreme Military Council , denounced the initiative. “All of this initiative does not interest us. Russia is a partner with the regime in killing the Syrian people,” he told reporters in Istanbul. “A crime against humanity has been committed, and there is not any mention of accountability.” An immediate test of the viability of the accord will come within a week, when the Syrian government is to provide a “comprehensive listing” of its chemical arsenal. That list is to include the types and quantities of Syria’s poison gas, the chemical munitions it possesses, and the location of its storage, production and research sites. “The real final responsibility here is Syrian,” a senior Obama administration official said of the deal. Speaking at a joint news conference with his Russian counterpart, Secretary of State John Kerry said that “if fully implemented, this framework can provide greater protection and security to the world.” If Mr. Assad fails to comply with the agreement, the issue would be referred to the United Nations Security Council, where the violations would be taken up under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter , which authorizes punitive action, Mr. Kerry said. Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov of Russia made clear that his country, which wields a veto in the Security Council, had not withdrawn its objections to the use of force. If the Russians objected to punishing Syrian noncompliance with military action, however, the United States would still have the option of acting without the Security Council’s approval. “If diplomacy fails, the United States remains prepared to act,” President Obama said in a statement. The issue of removing Syria’s chemical arms broke into the open on Monday when Mr. Kerry, at a news conference in London, posed the question of whether Mr. Assad could rapidly be disarmed, only to state that he did not see how it could be done. Less than a week later, what once seemed impossible has become a plan — one that will depend on Mr. Assad’s cooperation and that will need to be put in place in the middle of a fierce conflict. To reach the agreement, arms control officials on both sides worked into the night, a process that recalled treaty negotiations during the cold war. Mr. Kerry and Mr. Lavrov held a marathon series of meetings on Friday, including a session that ended at midnight. On Saturday morning, the two sides reconvened with their arms control experts on the hotel pool deck as they pored over the text of the agreement. Obama administration officials say Russia’s role is critical since it has been a major backer of the Assad government, and the American assumption is that much, if not all, of the accord has Mr. Assad’s assent. At the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, the secretary general, pledged to support the agreement, and he announced that Syria had also formally acceded to the international Chemical Weapons Convention , effective Oct. 14. In his statement, Mr. Obama called the use of chemical weapons “an affront to human dignity and a threat to the security of people everywhere.” “We have a duty to preserve a world free from the fear of chemical weapons for our children,” he said. “Today marks an important step towards achieving this goal.” Foreign Secretary William Hague of Britain issued a statement after a call with Mr. Kerry in which he welcomed the agreement on Syrian chemical weapons as a “a significant step forward.” It was a British parliamentary vote against military action that dampened momentum by the United States, France and Britain to conduct airstrikes in the wake of an August chemical strike in Syria. “The priority must now be full and prompt implementation of the agreement, to ensure the transfer of Syria’s chemical weapons to international control,” Mr. Hague said. Under the agreement, titled “Framework for Elimination of Syrian Chemical Weapons,” an inspection of the chemical weapons sites identified by the Syrian government must be completed by November. Equipment for producing chemical weapons and filling munitions with poison gas must be destroyed by November. The document also says there is to be “complete elimination of all chemical weapons material and equipment in the first half of 2014.” A priority under the agreement reached Saturday is to take steps to preclude or diminish the Assad government’s ability to employ chemical weapons before they are destroyed. An American official said such steps could include burning the least volatile component of binary weapons, a type of chemical agent that becomes potent only when separate elements are mixed. Another way to disable at least part of Syria’s stockpile, the official said, would be to destroy the equipment for mixing the binary component or destroying the munitions or bombs that would be filled with chemical agents. An American official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity under State Department protocol, said the United States and Russia had agreed that Syria has 1,000 tons of chemical weapons, including sarin and mustard gas. The United States believes at least 45 sites in Syria are associated with its chemical weapons program. Nearly half of these have “exploitable quantities” of chemical weapons, though the American official said the Assad government may have moved some of the agents. The American official said there was no indication that any of Syria’s chemical stocks had been moved to Iraq or Lebanon, as the Syrian opposition had charged. “We believe they are under regime control,” the official said. Russia has not accepted the American data on the number of chemical weapons sites. The difference may reflect the larger disagreement as to who was responsible for an Aug. 21 attack that the United States says killed at least 1,400 civilians, many of them women and children. If the Russians were to agree both on the number of chemical weapons sites and that the sites are all in government-controlled areas, that would suggest that the Assad government was culpable for the attack, and not the rebel forces as the Russians have asserted. The four-page framework agreement, including its technical annexes, is to be incorporated in a Security Council resolution that is to be adopted in New York. One concern in carrying out the deal, however, involves how to protect international inspectors who go to Syria. There will be no cease-fire so the inspectors can carry out their work. Asked whether rebels would aid the inspectors, General Idris, the Western-backed rebel military commander, called the issue “complicated,” saying, “If investigators come, we will facilitate the mission.” He said there were no chemical weapons in rebel-controlled areas, adding: “I don’t know if this will just mean that investigators will pass through the regions that are under rebel control. We are ready.” The sense of betrayal among nominally pro-Western factions in the opposition has grown intensely in recent days. In the northern Syrian province of Idlib, a rebel stronghold, one commander said that the agreement on Saturday proved that the United States no longer cared about helping Syrians and was leaving them at the mercy of a government backed by powerful allies in Russia and Iran. Maysara, a commander of a battalion in Saraqeb, said in an interview that he had paid little attention to the diplomacy on Saturday. “I don’t care about deals anymore,” he said in an interview. “The Americans found a way out of the strike.” He added: “The Russians did what they want. The Americans lied, and believed their own lie — the U.S. doesn’t want democracy in Syria. Now I have doubts about the U.S. capacities, their military and intelligence capacities. The Iranian capacity is much stronger, I guess.” Peter Baker contributed reporting from Washington, and Anne Barnard from Beirut, Lebanon. video Advertisement"
"Fix business rates says Asos amid threat of digital sales tax","Online fashion retailer sees UK sales rise by 23% while bricks-and-mortar rivals flounder  Wed 17 Oct 2018 19.39 BST   First published on Wed 17 Oct 2018 15.30 BST   The government should focus on fixing business rates and corporation tax, the boss of the online fashion retailer Asos has said in response to the threat of a new digital sales tax. Asos highlighted the deep divide between the fortunes of online retailers and traditional rivals on Wednesday when it revealed a step-up in sales growth over the summer, when many high street stores have closed . The online retailer said sales rose 23% in the UK in the year to 31 August, “accelerating as the year progressed”. The performance is in stark contrast to some high street rivals, including Superdry and Ted Baker , which have partly blamed the heatwave for disappointing trading over the summer. The divide in fortunes has led bricks-and-mortar retailers to call for changes to the tax system, which disproportionately levies charges on those with a network of physical stores via business rates. Dave Lewis, the boss of Tesco, recently called for a 2% tax on any goods sold online as a way to even the playing field for struggling high street retailers after a wave of closures across the UK. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, is meanwhile considering a digital services tax on UK advertising revenue, which would affect the likes of Google and Facebook. Nick Beighton, chief executive of Asos, said: “Our responsibility and obligation is to pay the tax rate that the jurisdictions or government set us, and we will do that.” But he added that the “core problems to solve and where the attention should be” was adjusting business rates and tackling the practice of companies organising their corporate structures so that profits made in the UK were recognised abroad and so not subject to taxes here. “It strikes me that the core problems to solve and where the attention should be is on solving corporation tax leakage and fixing business rates,” he said. Asos’s UK sales increased over the summer as its twentysomething shoppers bagged its new beauty range and sporty clothing. Beighton said sales of activewear had tripled and beauty sales were up 50% after the relaunch of the group’s own-label skincare and beauty range, Face + Body. He said the results were the product of “doing the things we do really well. We are a very, very innovative, fast-paced organisation”, adding that the group had improved its service and was quick off the mark on trends including animal print and button-through dresses. “We recognise there are tough trading conditions. Our results we’re very happy with, but they could have been better,” he said. Beighton said there had been inflation in the UK fashion industry, fuelled partly by the drop in the value of the pound, but Asos pulled in shoppers by holding its prices and bringing in lower-priced goods. The strong UK performance combined with a better than expected 28% increase in sales in the EU, partly helped by launching its Premier service, which offers a year’s free next-day delivery for under £10 in countries including Ireland, Denmark and the Netherlands. Asos said it had increased the number of Premier customers, who are mostly in the UK, by 53% to 1.3 million. Overall the group increased sales by 26% to £2.4bn, while pre-tax profits rose 28% to £102m as the company increased US sales by a quarter. Beighton said it was not yet clear how Brexit might affect future trading at the London-based company, which took on about 1,000 new staff last year, including some EU nationals. “I have a concern about whatever comes out of Brexit, [and whether it] will affect the flow of talent into London especially,” he said. But he said that Asos continued to innovate, playing to the trend for gender-neutral dressing with its new Collusion range, which launched earlier this month. The company has also launched Enki, its own voice-search service with Google Assistant. Asos’s claim to be “the world’s No 1 destination for fashion-loving twentysomethings” hits the nail on the head when it comes to identifying the source of its success at commerce and content, writes Scarlett Conlon . It currently has curated photo galleries of corduroy suits, heritage blazers and sequins – all recent catwalk trends that are now being peddled by tastemakers, from fashion publications to Instagram influencers. Remember Generation Z is the postmillennial cohort seduced by immediacy and won’t be kept waiting (so the fashion experts say). That Asos is one of the quickest retailers to translate a trend into shoppable product stands squarely to its advantage when targeting this demographic. The same strategy applies to its editorial features that curate the latest inspiring street-style images to hook its users’ attention and then offers them the chance to “shop the look”. Not to mention its Insiders Community, a platform where shoppers can buy their favourite Instagram stars’ outfits using the hashtag #OOTD (outfit of the day). The fact that the fashion is inclusive is key. Asos is known to have one of the widest-ranging sizing in the fashion industry and doesn’t shy away from diverse representation. In 2017 its swimwear campaign featured untouched images of models with stretch marks and it cast the plus-sized model Vivian Eyo-Ephraim to model its 2018 line. Asos features rising stars in its ad campaigns and on the cover of its magazine who have something to say, like Jazelle, J Hus, Jorja Smith and Naomi Shimada (and who its customers listen to and follow). It’s an approach Generation Z demands of brands and Asos has delivered. That the styling is great (its cross-brand selling is spot on), delivery is speedy, and returns are super easy (research says lenient return policies increases purchases and limits returns) seals the deal."
"Iran Says It Is Making Nuclear Fuel, Defying U.N.","Advertisement By NAZILA FATHI , DAVID E. SANGER and WILLIAM J. BROAD APRIL 12, 2006  TEHRAN, April 11 — Iran announced Tuesday that its nuclear engineers had advanced to a new phase in the enrichment of uranium, and President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and a series of the country's ruling clerics declared that the nation would now speed ahead, in defiance of a United Nations Security Council warning, to produce nuclear fuel on an industrial scale. "Iran has joined the nuclear countries of the world," Mr. Ahmadinejad said during a large, carefully staged and nationally televised celebration in Mashhad, which included video presentations of each step of the nuclear process that he declared Iran had mastered. "The nuclear fuel cycle at the laboratory level has been completed, and uranium with the desired enrichment for nuclear power plants was achieved." The White House, which has charged that Iran is secretly trying to develop fuel for nuclear weapons, at first reacted mildly to the announcement, saying  Iran  was "moving in the wrong direction." But later in the day it sounded a more ominous tone, with the National Security Council announcing that the United States would work with the United Nations Security Council "to deal with the significant threat posed by the regime's efforts to acquire nuclear weapons." Outside experts said that while the country appears to have passed a milestone — one it has approached before with smaller-scale enrichment of uranium — the announcement may have had less to do with an engineering feat than with carefully timed political theater intended to convince the West that the program is unstoppable. Advertisement The declaration comes at a time of intense speculation in Washington that preliminary plans are advancing to take military action against Iran's nuclear sites if diplomacy fails, an idea Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld dismissed Tuesday as "fantasy land." Advertisement The director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed ElBaradei, is scheduled to arrive in Tehran on Wednesday  to make  another appeal for Iran to halt its enrichment program and avoid a confrontation with the West. Iranian officials said Dr. ElBaradei would face a changed situation, and American officials said they suspected that Iran's strategy is to portray its effort as a fait accompli. The news came as another major setback for the European nations that have pressed for three years to persuade Iran to halt its fuel production program, and for President Bush. On Monday, Mr. Bush repeated that his "stated goal" was that "we do not want the Iranians to have a nuclear weapon, the capacity to make a nuclear weapon, or the knowledge as to how to make a nuclear weapon." For that reason, he has opposed allowing Iran to enrich uranium, even though Iran has signed the  Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and has the right to produce fuel for nuclear power reactors. If the Iranian declaration is correct, the enrichment and what appear to be rudimentary bomb-making documents that international inspectors have found in Iran suggest Iranians may now have most of the knowledge that Mr. Bush has sought to deny them. At the least, they appear poised to be able eventually to expand enrichment on an industrial scale and, if they are determined to do so, enrich the uranium to levels necessary for an atomic weapon. But so far the quantities that the country has produced appear to be minuscule, and the enrichment level announced today — 3.5 percent — would work for producing power, not warheads. International inspectors are stationed at Iran's main enrichment facility at Natanz, and presumably will be able to confirm or refute Iranian claims in coming days, assuming they have access to centrifuges. Centrifuges are devices whose rotors spin very rapidly to enrich, or concentrate, a rare form of uranium known as uranium 235, which can then be used to fuel nuclear reactors or atom bombs. The 164 centrifuges Iran said it has strung together in a cascade are enough to test the technology, but with such a small number would take years to produce enough uranium for even one weapon. Advertisement "This 164 machines is more industrial," said a European diplomat who monitors  Iran's  program and spoke on the condition of anonymity. "But still, it's not like they haven't come close to achieving this in the past." Despite claims on Tuesday of an enrichment breakthrough, Iran has in the past seven years repeatedly used centrifuges and lasers to enrich uranium, according to reports by the nuclear agency. But the amounts  have apparently been small and the setups experimental. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter. You must select a newsletter to subscribe to. Mr. Ahmadinejad reiterated  that Iran's nuclear program was being developed for industrial and power purposes alone,  and  said his country "does not get its strength from nuclear arsenals." But he did his best to turn the development to political advantage. "I declare at this historic moment, with the blessings of God almighty and the efforts of our scientists, that we have mastered the nuclear fuel cycle on a laboratory scale and on Sunday our young scientists have produced enriched uranium required for nuclear plants," Mr. Ahmadinejad said. "Access to the nuclear fuel cycle is a national demand and our people have repeatedly stressed that they want to have it." His speech, given before a mural of doves in flight and a motto in English, was bracketed by recitations from the Koran and followed by chants of "God is Great." Before he spoke, a small parade of men in traditional costumes danced as a thin silver box said to contain the first enriched uranium was carried to the stage. An announcer said the box would be preserved at a museum. State-run television repeatedly showed footage of  scientists in white uniforms working in what seemed to be a nuclear facility. Mr. Ahmadinejad was careful to position Iran as operating within the existing proliferation rules, saying his country's nuclear activities have been "under complete, unprecedented" supervision by the atomic energy agency. Advertisement But he did not mention that he has restricted the access of those inspectors to some sites in recent months, and that inspectors have yet to receive explanations of the documents that appear to have bomb designs, or an explanation of the centrifuge equipment and designs the country bought in the mid-1990's from Abdul Qadeer Khan, the Pakistani nuclear engineer who  helped start Iran's program. Mr. Ahmadinejad said Iran  would continue to allow inspectors to watch its progress. "Today we are interested to operate under I.A.E.A. supervision what has been achieved," he said. "And what is going to be achieved in the future is within the framework of the rights of the nation." David Albright, president of the Institute for Science and International Security, a private research group in Washington, said that the announcement  had been expected, but that the quantities of enriched uranium were probably small. "They need to learn a lot more to produce it in significant quantities and they need to build a lot more centrifuges," he said. Dr. ElBaradei is required to report back to the Security Council by April 28 on whether Iran has acceded to the demand late last month that it shut down its facilities within 30 days. One senior European diplomat said that in Iran, Dr. ElBaradei will "argue that they've gotten to enrichment, so it's time to shut the process down, and end the problem." The question of whether Iran has the right to continue nuclear research has been at the heart of the conflict between Iran and the United States and its European allies this year. Iran  rejected a Russian offer to enrich uranium in Russia for an Iranian nuclear plant because the deal would not allow any nuclear activity in Iran.

"Russia offers to sell anti-aircraft missiles to Iran","Tehran said to be considering offer, which could have an impact on nuclear talks approaching a deadline next month  Julian Borger , diplomatic editor  Mon 23 Feb 2015 19.56 GMT   Last modified on Wed 29 Nov 2017 22.52 GMT   Russia has reportedly offered to sell Iran powerful and advanced anti-aircraft missiles in a deal that could have an impact on nuclear talks approaching a deadline next month. Sergei Chemezov, head of the Russian state arms conglomerate Rostec, was quoted by the Tass news agency as saying the firm was willing to supply Tehran with Antey-2500 missiles with the capability of intercepting and destroying ballistic and cruise missiles as well as aircraft. Chemezov said Tehran was considering the offer. If the sale goes ahead, the missiles are likely to represent a significant defence against any future air strikes aimed at Iran’s nuclear facilities, and so could in theory diminish pressure on Iran to come to an agreement in nuclear negotiations. Conversely, if the talks fail, a missile deal could raise pressure from Israel and from US hawks for military action before the delivery of the Russian weapons makes air strikes riskier and less effective. Israel’s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, is due to deliver an address to the US Congress next week in which he is expected to urge the administration to take a tougher line against Iran.  The planned sale of a less sophisticated and shorter-range surface-to-air missile system, the S-300, was cancelled in 2010 after concerted Israeli and US pressure on Moscow. But since then Vladimir Putin has returned to the presidency in place of the more conciliatory Dmitry Medvedev, Moscow’s relations with the west have dramatically worsened over the Ukraine conflict, and the sharp drop in the oil price together with western sanctions have left Moscow increasingly desperate to find new sources of foreign currency. Russian arms sales last year generated $13bn (£8.4bn). “As far as Iran is concerned, we offered Antey-2500 instead of S-300. They are thinking. No decision has been made yet,” Chemezov said, according to Tass. “I don’t conceal it, and everyone understands this, the more conflicts there are, the more they buy off weapon from us. Volumes are continuing to grow despite sanctions. Mainly, it’s Latin America and the Middle East.” In Geneva on Monday, nuclear talks adjourned after the latest in a long series of meetings between the US secretary of state, John Kerry, and his Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif. The negotiations are aimed at finding a formula by which Iran accepts curbs on its nuclear programme – particularly uranium enrichment – for a certain number of years, in return for sanctions relief. Kerry and Zarif were joined in Geneva for the first time by the head of the Iranian atomic energy organisation, Ali Akbar Salehi, and the US energy secretary, Ernest Moniz, in a development which negotiators described as necessary to confront the complex technical issues at the heart of the talks. Hossein Fereydoun, the brother of Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, also took part in the latest discussions. Diplomats from US and Iran, as well as the other parties to the talks – UK, France, Germany, Russia and China – are due to reconvene in Switzerland next week in an attempt to reach a framework agreement before a deadline of late March. They have until the end of June to fill in all the details of what would be a complex but historic accord. US and Iranian negotiators characterised the Geneva talks as constructive, with progress made but still a long way to go. Ali Vaez, senior Iran analyst at the International Crisis Group, said: “It appears that the final touches to a mutually acceptable formula for curtailing Iran’s enrichment capacity were added by Iranian and American nuclear chiefs. What remains is a similar solution for untangling the intricate spider web of sanctions.” The proposed missile sale appears to have been discussed by the Russian defence minister, General Sergey Shoigu, when he visited Tehran last month. The two countries have been in dispute since the cancellation of the S-300 delivery five years ago. The Antey-2500 is an improved version of the S-300 with a longer range and enhanced capabilities. Nato labels the system as the SA-23 Gladiator. It is a mobile system, launched from tracked vehicles complete with radar and command post. It can launch a variety of anti-ballistic missiles, depending on the nature of the target it has to intercept. Its Russian maker claims it can stop not only missiles and fixed-wing aircraft but also drones and precision-guided bombs. Russia has sold the same system to China, Vietnam and Cyprus."
"The Making of an Iran Policy","Advertisement By ROGER COHEN JULY 30, 2009  The silent protest began in Imam Khomeini Square in front of the forbidding Ministry of Telecommunications, which was busy cutting off cellphones but powerless to stop the murmured rage coursing through Tehran. Six days had passed since Iran ’s disputed June 12 election, but the fury that brought three million people onto the streets the previous Monday showed no sign of abating. “Silence will win against bullets,” a woman beside me whispered. Her name was Zahra. She wore a green headband — the color adopted by the campaign of the defeated reformist candidate Mir Hussein Moussavi — and she held a banner saying, “This land is my land.” The words captured the popular conviction that not only had President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad stolen votes, but he also had made off with Iran’s dignity. Slowly the vast crowd began to move north. No chant issued from the throng, only distilled indignation. A young man asked me where I was from. When I told him New York, he shot back: “Give our regards to freedom. It’s coming right here!” In those giddy postelectoral days, anything seemed possible, even the arrival of liberty, or at least more of it, in the 30-year-old Islamic Republic. Through the swirl of events — the huge crowds, the beatings and the sirens, the tear gas and black smoke — the core issues were simple. Iranians felt cheated. They wanted their votes to count. They knew that no genuine victor with two-thirds of the vote need resort to brutality or fear a recount. Sometimes they asked me if the United Nations would help them; often they asked if America would. It was their way of saying, with fierce emotion, that the morality of the Iranian story, its right and wrong, was plain. But it was precisely emotion, and notions of good and evil, that the Obama administration had spent the previous months trying to drain from the charged U.S.-Iranian relationship. Sobriety dominated the ideas of the president’s Iran team, as I’d learned before I left in conversations with senior officials at the State Department and the National Security Council. The Bush administration’s ideologically driven axis-of-evil approach to Iran had failed. Tehran had prospered by expanding its regional influence and was accelerating its nuclear program. The Obama administration believed it was time to seek normalization through a new, cooler look at a nation critical to U.S. strategic interests — from advancing Israeli-Arab peace negotiations to a successful withdrawal from Iraq. “Who they select as leader in Iran is their prerogative, and there’s nothing we can do to control that,” Ray Takeyh, an Iranian-born adviser to Dennis Ross, the veteran Mideast negotiator who has been working on Iran for the Obama administration, told me before the election. “We’re trying to deal with Iran as an entity, a state, rather than privileging one faction or another. We want to inject a degree of rationality into this relationship, reduce it to two nations with some differences and some common interests — get beyond the incendiary rhetoric.” Takeyh’s words reminded me of Ross, who in his book “Statecraft” defined the term’s first principles as, “Have clear objectives, tailor them to fit reality.” Advertisement But now, as the crowd streaming before me demonstrated, Iran’s reality had changed. In his inaugural address, President Obama said: “To those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent, know that you are on the wrong side of history, but that we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist.” Seldom had a fist been clenched more unequivocally, dissent silenced more harshly or deceit practiced with more brazenness than in Iran after June 12. Advertisement Still, Obama’s Iran team — Ross; the courtly under secretary of state William Burns; the dapper deputy national security adviser Tom Donilon; the studious senior N.S.C. official Puneet Talwar (the only one, other than Takeyh, who has been to Iran); the hard-charging organization man Denis McDonough, who controls strategic communication at the White House — faced a difficult choice between sticking with strategic outreach to the regime and questioning its legitimacy in the name of human rights. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, whose instincts on Iran have always been more hawkish than the president’s, “was pushing for a harder line sooner after the June 12 vote,” a Mideast expert close to her told me last month. She was supported by her friend Joe Biden, the vice president. They did not prevail. The tone was cautious; although Obama’s denunciations of the clampdown grew stronger as it worsened, the extended hand, which had proved more unsettling to Iran than all the Bush administration bluster, was not withdrawn. When I returned from Iran, I went to see one of these senior officials to ask what it had been like making that call. Painful, was the response. Every day, in the election’s aftermath, the team met and conference-called. “It is difficult to weigh all the different considerations,” this official told me. “But given the profoundly serious consequences of an Iranian regime that acquires a nuclear-weapons capability, the judgment in the end was that it was important to follow through on the offer of direct engagement.” He noted that this offer had been “signaled clearly in the course of the campaign” by Obama, and developed since. In other words, this goes deep with the president. He’s driving Iran policy. The Iran gambit lies close to the core of his refashioned global strategy, America’s “new era of engagement.” Just how far Obama is ready to go in engagement’s name has become clearer in Iran. At the time of that Thursday demonstration, almost a week after the election, the toughest thing he had found to say about the turmoil was that the suppression of peaceful dissent “is of concern to me and it’s of concern to the American people.” He had also equated Ahmadinejad with Moussavi, from the U.S. national-security standpoint, because both support the nuclear program, even as people died for the greater openness that Moussavi espoused. A sobered America is back in the realpolitik game. A favored phrase in the Iran team goes, “It is what it is.” Now the question is whether such an approach can yield results. Can Ross honor his own precept to match objectives with “available means”? To the nuclear clock has been added a democracy clock, complicating every diplomatic equation. An Iran of mullahs and nukes has morphed, for many Americans, into the Iran of beautiful, young Neda Agha-Soltan, cut down with a single shot while leaving a June 20 demonstration, a murder caught on video that went viral. Whatever Obama’s realism — and it’s as potent as his instinct for the middle ground — a president on whom so much youthful idealism has been projected can scarcely ignore the Neda effect. The Obama administration’s strong conviction, as several officials told me, is that Ahmadinejad’s election was fraudulent. But in the American interest, it is ready to overlook that and to talk. Restored relations with the Soviet Union came in 1933 at the time of the Great Terror, and with China in 1972 in the middle of the Cultural Revolution. But of course the bloodshed then — of an altogether different dimension — was not being YouTubed around the globe. One of the first people I saw in Iran was Saeed Leylaz, an economist close to Moussavi. (Like many of Iran’s reformist intellectuals, Leylaz is now in jail.) He told me Obama’s outreach — his recognition of the Islamic Republic and pledge of “mutual respect” — had affected the campaign, unsettling hard-liners. “Radicalism creates radicalism,” Leylaz said. He was referring to the way President Bush’s talk of Iran as evil opened the way for Ahmadinejad to build a global brand of sorts through lambasting U.S. arrogance. By contrast, a black American president of partly Muslim descent reaching out to the Islamic world — and demonstrating, by his very election, the possibility of change — had placed the Iranian regime on the defensive. One conservative Iranian official put it this way to Karim Sadjadpour, an Iran expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace: “If Iran can’t make nice with a U.S. president named Barack Hussein Obama who’s preaching mutual respect and sending us greetings, it’s pretty clear the problem lies in Tehran, not Washington.” Advertisement Tom Donilon, the deputy national-security adviser, told me in Washington: “Engagement was pressure. There’s no doubt about it.” The Obama administration — as Donilon, Takeyh and others made clear to me — had been deliberately agnostic on the election outcome and had tried to finesse electoral uncertainty by directing its diplomatic overture chiefly at Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader. In early May, Obama sent Khamenei a secret personal letter, as The Washington Times reported. The letter proposed a framework for talks on the nuclear issue (which Khamenei is believed to control) and regional security. I was reliably informed by more than one knowledgeable American that Khamenei had answered in writing, but the reply was disappointing. Still, it was a response — and Khamenei had already replied in March to a conciliatory message sent by Obama on Nowruz, the Persian new year, by saying, “Should you change, our behavior will change, too.” The administration was geared to bring its engagement policy to fruition after the June 12 election. The two things it had not planned for, however, were a situation of near-insurrection and Khamenei’s shift out of the arbiter’s lofty cover into explicit alignment with Ahmadinejad. Yet here, all of a sudden, was a situation where Obama’s outreach may have helped throw the Islamic Republic into crisis, leaving it more divided than at any time since immediately after the revolution in 1979. So it’s perhaps no wonder that Obama responded cautiously, clearly trying, with difficulty, to adapt a set strategy to an explosive situation, not wanting to cut the slender thread established to Khamenei but increasingly outraged by what he saw. Some protesters I met on the streets of Tehran pointedly asked me, “Where’s Obama?” Trying to rethink things, it seems. Khamenei’s own shift was cemented in his ferocious sermon a week after the election, when he embraced Ahmadinejad and tried to blame the whole bloody fiasco on “evil” Western agents. This stance undermined the thinking Ross and others had put forward in their thorough pre-election review of Iran policy. “The theory was always that you deal with the supreme leader because Ahmadinejad is not the ultimate decision maker,” said a senior official who has been instrumental in formulating Iran policy. “But then he takes Ahmadinejad’s side. You still have to make the effort, the ground has to be covered, but it’s hard to be very optimistic.” How long Iran’s disarray will persist is unclear — certainly weeks, probably months, perhaps longer. It is possible that Khamenei, come the fall, may see in outreach to the United States a means to regain support in a country where whoever delivers normalization with Washington will be a popular hero. It is possible that Ahmadinejad will bring moderates into his government, to be formed in August, with a similar conciliatory aim. One key indicator will be whether he keeps Saeed Jalili, described to me as a chief architect of the clampdown, as his nuclear negotiator. If he does, talks are probably a waste of time. It is even a remote possibility that Ahmadinejad will be removed in the name of reconciliation. But one thing is certain: Iran’s upheaval has made Obama’s already ambitious goal of engagement far more arduous, and it reinforced the darkest views of Iran’s true nuclear ambitions, even as it chews up limited time. There was always an orphaned feel to the Office of the Special Adviser to the Secretary of State for the Gulf and Southwest Asia. It was located just past the main entrance to the State Department in a string of tawdry rooms, a long way from the gilded mirrors and chandeliers up on the seventh floor, where top officials congregate. For four months starting in late February, Dennis Ross made this dun-colored warren his home. Then, in late June, he forsook one opaque title for another: Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for the Central Region. The “central region,” a U.S. diplomatic neologism, includes the central locus of American concerns for war and peace: the danger lands between Israel and Pakistan. In his new post, Ross is moving from State to the National Security Council, from Hillary Clinton’s universe to Obama’s. For now he’s shuttling between the two. That’s a familiar form of motion for a go-between who devoted years to knocking Israeli and Palestinian heads together in a vain quest for peace. As he goes, Ross, who is 60, nurses a late-life obsession that never surfaced — indeed, was artfully hidden — in the descriptions of his two jobs: Iran. But beneath the White House and Foggy Bottom circumlocutions, Iran is Ross’s new thing. Ross, like almost every serving U.S. diplomat, has never set foot in Iran. Thirty years of severed relations since the 1979 Iranian revolution have put any firsthand experience at a premium. But Ross is skilled at circumventing obstacles. With his mild, blue-eyed gaze, he is a survivor. In fact he’s one of the ultimate Washington survivors, having glided from Republican to Democratic administrations for more than a quarter-century. As it became clear in recent years that Iran, still marginal during the Camp David negotiations in 2000, had moved toward the hub of Middle Eastern matters, Ross moved with it. He has his finger to the wind. He also has a deep intellectual commitment to peacemaking and Israeli security, issues on which an Iran with a fast-growing nuclear program now impinges with centrifugal intensity. Advertisement “Iran is sucking up the oxygen, it’s everywhere in town, to the point that even Arab-Israeli issues seem somehow derivative,” Aaron David Miller, a former diplomat who worked for many years alongside Ross, told me. “And Dennis saw the handwriting on the wall.” Part of that handwriting was that nonengagement had failed. Iran, for nigh on two generations of U.S. diplomats, has been the great black hole. “Diplomacy is conducted face to face between human beings, but I worked for three years, day in, day out, on Iran and never got to meet an Iranian diplomat,” Nicholas Burns, who was under secretary of state from 2005 to 2008 (and is no relation to his successor as under secretary, William Burns), told me. “The policy did not work.” Over eight Bush years, Iran became stronger. American intervention had rid it of its Taliban enemy to the east and the hated Saddam Hussein to the west. Iran installed 7,200 centrifuges, produced more than a ton of low-enriched uranium and made a decisive step toward the threshold nuclear status that could prompt an Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear installations. The hawks of the Bush administration threatened, but their aims, in Ross’s phrase, were not matched to means. Already at war in neighboring Iraq and Afghanistan, the U.S. military had no stomach for a third front in the Muslim world — a calculus not lost on Iranian leaders. I went to see the Ross team, still in the State Department warren, on my return from Tehran. Ross talks in an even patter that bears a laid-back trace of his native California. He has a penchant for intricate phrases like: If they’re not responding, nonresponse would become a response. An engaging sincerity and a smile offset this highfalutin streak. His message to me in March was: we have a ticking clock to armed conflict; our former policy has failed; so let’s see if we can’t identify a set of their objectives not completely incompatible with ours. Now he wanted to hear all about the tumult I had witnessed. His response was measured: the president has laid out a path, we have to be judicious, not make a leap in one direction or another, and so put the onus on Iran. (Ross declined my request for an on-the-record interview.) Balance is something this meticulous diplomat prizes. But a recurrent issue with Ross, who embraced the Jewish faith after being raised in a nonreligious home by a Jewish mother and Catholic stepfather, has been whether he is too close to the American Jewish community and Israel to be an honest broker with Iran or Arabs. Miller, after years of working with Ross, concluded in a book that he “had an inherent tendency to see the world of Arab-Israeli politics first from Israel’s vantage point rather than that of the Palestinians.” Another former senior State Department official, who requested anonymity because he didn’t want to jeopardize his relationship with the administration, told me, “Ross’s bad habit is preconsultation with the Israelis.” Ross earned $421,775 from speeches last year, of which more than half came from Israeli and Jewish groups, according to a financial-disclosure statement. But Ross has argued in his books that his passion for peace guides him in an evenhanded attempt to pursue every possible diplomatic avenue. “He’s the most intellectually flexible, thoughtful and pragmatic person I have met,” Takeyh told me. “I’ve never had a conversation with him where he says we shouldn’t consider something because it would cross some Israeli red line. That’s just not where we are. The idea that he’s just looking for engagement with Iran to tick some box before moving to harsh measures is just wrong and fraudulent.” Israel, which sees an existential threat in a nuclear Iran, has made clear that its patience is limited. The Ross team does not think Israelis are bluffing. They believe Israel views Iran in life-and-death terms. Israeli officials have argued that they don’t believe Iran would ever be crazy enough to nuke them but do believe the change in the balance of power with a nuclear or near-nuclear Iran could be so decisive that Jews would begin to leave Israel. So Ross’s old and new obsessions — Israel and Iran — have merged in a perilous countdown. As he moves to the N.S.C. to work alongside his old friend Tom Donilon, he faces a fundamental question: can this baggage-encumbered veteran who wrote an 800-page tome on Israel-Palestine called “The Missing Peace” overcome ingrained habits and sympathies to uncover what’s been missing? Obama is trying to reinvent Middle East thinking. He’s questioning America’s uncritical stance toward Israel, drawing Syria in and pursuing the Iran gambit against great odds. Conventional thinking will not deliver what the president seeks. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter. You must select a newsletter to subscribe to. The odyssey that has now led Ross to the N.S.C. has been bizarre. His original appointment at State was a fiasco. Weeks before the inauguration , an internal memo from the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, where he was working, was leaked. It said Ross “has accepted an invitation to join the Obama administration as ambassador at large and senior adviser to Secretary of State-designate Hillary Clinton. In that seventh-floor job, designed especially for him, Ambassador Ross will be the secretary’s top adviser on a range of Middle East issues, from the Arab-Israeli peace process to Iran.” Advertisement Clinton was displeased. The no-drama Obama team felt jostled. But Obama owed Ross one. He was influential during the campaign in bringing around the American Jewish community. For a month after the inauguration, Ross hovered in limbo. The eventual fudge was the Iran dossier at State, disguised in a broader job description, and communicated in a stealth nocturnal announcement. But William Burns, the former ambassador to Moscow, whom Obama had met and liked in Russia on his first overseas trip as a senator, had already taken on Iran as under secretary of state. The situation was uncomfortable. When I asked at the White House in April if Ross was the point man on Iran, I met with the retort that the address for Iran at the State Department was clear: Bill Burns. When Burns — who worked under Ross on Middle East issues during James Baker’s tenure as secretary of state and now found himself senior to him — went to London in April to brief allies on the new U.S.-Iran policy, he did not take Ross with him. Instead, he traveled with Talwar, the National Security Council official working on Iran. One Iranian-American sometimes consulted by the administration told me he’d had calls from the White House, asking, “Will the Iranians be prepared to meet with Ross?” That was a reasonable question given Ross’s well-known ties with the American Jewish community and the sometimes hawkish views on Iran — including endorsing a report that called for Obama to “begin augmenting the military lever right away” — that he expressed before his appointment. (Ross also argued at other times for unconditional engagement backed by the threat of draconian sanctions.) When I was in Iran in February, a conservative newspaper editor, Hossein Shariatmadari, told me, “If you want to signal a hard line and no change toward Iran, nobody does that better for you than Ross.” At State, there were also issues. Ross, who assembled an eight-member crew in his first-floor office, was far from Clinton’s inner circle up on the seventh floor. She made it clear from the outset she wanted a fresh Mideast team. “He was not a happy camper,” Martin Indyk, a former ambassador to Israel, told me, referring to Ross. But tensions were contained within the no-drama collegiality that is Obama’s diktat. Clinton has worked hard to bury her own Iran differences with the president, to avoid getting Powellized and to be what Indyk calls “the good, disciplined lieutenant.” While calling Iran’s postelection actions “deplorable and unacceptable” in a foreign-policy speech on July 15, Clinton said: “We remain ready to engage with Iran, but the time for action is now. The offer will not remain open indefinitely.” Her Iran role, however, is clearly ancillary. Policy is being driven from the White House. McDonough told me the president asks about Iran “on a very regular basis and is very personally involved in this policy.” Now Obama will have Ross close by. The clincher to the move came when Obama’s June visit to Saudi Arabia proved disappointing. He got neither the Saudi help on Israel-Palestine nor the Saudi acceptance of prisoners from Guantánamo Bay that he had hoped for. The conclusion: more heft and Middle East experience, of the Ross variety, was needed at the N.S.C. Obama called Clinton personally to tell her Ross was moving. The transfer was a neat solution. It took Ross out of the front line in any eventual bilateral talks with Iran — a role that Ross had hoped to play but that the White House never saw him in. It got him out of Clinton and Burns’s immediate orbit, where his role was uneasy. Sure, the move marooned some new recruits in the first-floor State Department warren, irritated some National Security Council staff members who got a superior they didn’t feel they needed and worried the Mideast envoy, George Mitchell. But whoever said government, even Obama government, was not messy? Advertisement In Tehran, just before the election, I sat down with Nasser Hadian, who once taught at Columbia and is now at Tehran University. He’s an influential thinker on foreign affairs who got to know Ross while he was in the United States. Hadian told me that Iran has taken Obama’s outreach seriously. Hadian has been part of a group of foreign-policy experts, convened by Mahmoud Vaezi at the Center for Strategic Research in Tehran, who have been meeting every two weeks to review how to respond to the U.S. offer. Vaezi prepares reports that are submitted to Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, the reformist former president who has been bitterly critical of the June 12 vote, and to Khamenei himself. The discussions, I was told, have been detailed, including a review of who might lead any eventual bilateral negotiations from the Iranian side. One name that has been proposed is Ali Akbar Velayati, a former foreign minister who is a top adviser to Khamenei. In this light, the fact that Velayati praised Obama after the election for remaining quiet about it is interesting. Velayati also said, “America accepts a nuclear Iran, but Britain and France cannot stand a nuclear Iran.” This is a new language, however wide of the truth. The bizarre official lambasting of Britain — and demonizing of the BBC rather than the Voice of America — can be seen as the Iranian authorities trying to keep their U.S. options open. “My argument in all the meetings has been: You have to go for full normalization and comprehensive engagement on all the issues,” Hadian told me. “Not a U.S. consulate in Tehran, or the nuclear issue in isolation; that won’t work. And because I know we cannot normalize unless Israeli concerns are addressed, I’ve argued that Ross would be an important assurance, someone able to convince the American Jewish lobby that any eventual agreement is workable.” That view, he suggested, had gained some traction in Tehran. Hadian said Iran has looked at everyone in the policy mix — Burns, Ross, Talwar, Vali Nasr (an Iranian-American aide to Richard Holbrooke, the State Department envoy), Gary Samore (a nonproliferation expert at the N.S.C.), Tony Blinken (a national security adviser to Vice President Joe Biden) — and the general feeling was positive. “What Obama has already done for the United States in the Muslim world is unbelievable,” he said. “It is not easy for anyone here to attack him.” But Hadian is a reformist who backed Moussavi. The Iran he talked about has not disappeared postelection — Velayati is as influential as ever — but it’s shaken. Khamenei, who just turned 70, knows he is vulnerable right now; it’s far from clear he’d be ready to negotiate from vulnerability. His suspicion of the United States is deep; anti-Americanism has worked for him over a 20-year rule. “Khamenei still believes the United States wants to go back to the patron-client relationship and the nuclear issue is being used for that,” Sadjadpour, of the Carnegie Endowment, told me. Even if he chooses to talk, would it not be in pursuit of a familiar Iranian tactic — stringing things out, as the centrifuges spin, until cracks appear among the Western allies, or China and Russia come to Tehran’s defense? One thing is clear: Iran is no position to talk right now. It has no functioning national-security apparatus as its leaders scramble to shore up the regime. The republican pillar of the Islamic Republic has been destroyed to salvage a hard-line rightist order, but the price of this violent gamble in terms of lost support, internal division and external criticism has been immense. Iran has morphed in the global consciousness, to the point that U2 and Madonna have adopted the cause of Iranian democracy. With oil down and opposition up, Iran’s regional ascendancy is stalled or already in reverse. On April 29 , in Dammam, in Saudi Arabia’s eastern province, Ross sat down with King Abdullah. He talked to a skeptical monarch about the Obama administration’s engagement policy with Iran — and talked and talked and talked. When the king finally got to speak, according to one U.S. official fully briefed on the exchange, he began by telling Ross: “I am a man of action. Unlike you, I prefer not to talk a lot.” Then he posed several pointed questions about U.S. policy toward Iran: What is your goal? What will you do if this does not work? What will you do if the Chinese and the Russians are not with you? How will you deal with Iran’s nuclear program if there is not a united response? Ross, a little flustered, tried to explain that policy was still being fleshed out. The exchange was a useful reminder that the Obama administration is going to have to work very hard, even with its allies, to present a united front to Iran. Saudi Arabia may be full of millennial Arab suspicion of the Persians, and Ross may have all sorts of ideas about how the Saudis could use their petropower to undermine the Iranians (including by selling more oil to China), but the fact is the Saudis have had normal relations with Iran since 1991 and will always be more comfortable making life difficult for a Jewish state than for a fellow Muslim nation. Advertisement If the Saudis are difficult, they pale by comparison with the Russians and Chinese, who are partners with the U.S. in the six-power effort (known as P5+1) to curb Iran’s nuclear program. Indeed, what looms for the Obama administration is a core test, over Iran, of its new foreign-policy doctrine. This was defined by Hillary Clinton as follows: “We will lead by inducing greater cooperation among a greater number of actors and reducing competition, tilting the balance away from a multipolar world and toward a multipartner world.” But for all Obama’s efforts to multipartner — by reviving the relationship with Russia and a similar outreach to the Chinese — it is far from clear that Moscow and Beijing do not still see America’s Iran problem as a useful tool in building a multipolar world less dominated by Washington. Getting them to impose sanctions that really bite will be difficult. Iran is awash in Chinese products — trade has boomed in recent years — and it supplies 15 percent of China’s oil. “It’s going to be very tough,” one senior administration official told me. “The Russian calculus about Iran is only partly about their relationship with Iran and partly about their view of us. Everyone agrees it’s not a great idea for this Iranian regime to acquire a nuclear weapon, but there’s not the same urgency we have, and certainly not the same as the Israelis have.” There has always been what Donilon called a “back end” to Obama’s effort to talk with Iran, whether in the multilateral framework or in the dialogue he wants to establish to take the poison out of U.S.-Iranian relations. The back end is punitive sanctions, in the event engagement fails, that would change the Iranian calculus on further uranium refinement: cutting off Iranian banks’ access to credit; extending that isolation to insurance and shipping; stopping refined petroleum products from reaching Iran. For all that to happen, Obama will need to prove his outreach is more than rhetoric and that other nations have bought into the notion that a near-boycott of Iran should be imposed. The administration seems to believe that Iran, as one official put it, “is not 10 feet tall right now” and that means of suasion short of this dubious sanctions route still exist. It’s working to prize Syria away from the Iranian orbit, adopt a more pragmatic tone toward Hezbollah and Hamas and change Tehran’s risk calculus by talking of a sharp upgrade of the defense capacities of allies in the region — all with the objective of further unsettling and isolating a shaken government. Clinton has returned to talk of “crippling action” against Iran — not heard since April, when she spoke of “crippling sanctions” — and late last month introduced the notion of a “defense umbrella” in the region that would make Iran less secure, even with a nuclear weapon. The latter phrase displeased the Israelis: they viewed it as suggesting that the administration is now more focused on deterrence than prevention. What Obama’s precise tolerance threshold is for the Iranian nuclear program is in fact unclear. Officially, the administration still insists on the “zero option” — no enrichment, no reprocessing, no sensitive technology. But I heard talk of nonzero options — say a small enrichment facility for research operating under intrusive International Atomic Energy Agency inspection — if Iran makes a convincing effort to gain Western confidence and can demonstrate that a fuel cycle it controls will have only peaceful ends. It is also clear to me that a military strike on Iran by Israel is Obama’s least-favored outcome: it would inflame the region he’s trying to quiet and sabotage his outreach to the Muslim world, while perhaps only delaying Iran’s nuclear program a year or two. So deterrence may indeed be the administration’s reluctant bottom line. The president also has at his disposal a covert program inherited from the Bush administration aimed at sabotaging Iran’s nuclear program by penetrating its supply chain and undermining its computer systems. This has been under review, but could, if pushed forward, be used as an argument to the Israelis to hold off any military action. Would Israel attack Iran against express U.S. objections? Opinion is divided. The Ross team does not rule that out. Indyk thinks not. “Remember, Israel has second-strike capability,” he told me. “It wouldn’t be easy to live with an Iran that’s a virtual nuclear power, but at the end of the day, it’s not a complete disaster.” Normalization with Iran is a heady idea, comparable to the China breakthrough of 1972. It would create a far less dangerous world. The history-making idea captivated Obama, and it lingers still. Engagement remains on the table, and its unsettling effect on Iran’s domestic politics seem likely to endure. But since June 12, prospects of a U.S.-Iranian rapprochement have darkened. The possible explosion that now looms in Iran, were Israel to attack, could assume devastating proportions and expose America to heightened danger. Obama has staked a lot — arguably his whole “smart power” doctrine — on preventing that. For Ross, diplomacy is not just about realized goals, but about what you prevent, what you limit, what you contain, what you defuse. Successful diplomacy will take more than Obama-doctrine outreach. It will require a new form of American power to work, in avoiding the worst even if it cannot attain the dream. Roger Cohen is a columnist for The New York Times and The International Herald Tribune.

"Russia and U.S. Sign Nuclear Arms Reduction Pact","Advertisement By PETER BAKER and DAN BILEFSKY APRIL 8, 2010  PRAGUE — The United States and Russia opened what they called a new era in their tumultuous relationship on Thursday as they signed an arms control treaty and presented a largely united front against Iran’s nuclear program , marking a sharp change since they broke over the Georgia war two years ago. In a ceremony filled with flourish and the echoes of history, President Obama and President Dmitri A. Medvedev put aside the tensions of recent years to seal the New Start pact paring back their nuclear arsenals. The two leaders used the moment to showcase their growing personal relationship and a mutual commitment to cooperation on a host of issues. The celebratory mood in the majestic, gilded hall of Prague Castle masked stubborn divisions on matters like missile defense and European security. Mr. Obama avoided any public criticism of Russia’s human rights record. And while they resolved to seek even deeper cuts in nuclear weapons , such an agreement would be much harder to reach than the one they signed Thursday. The overthrow of the government in Kyrgyzstan likewise could quickly test the new bonds proclaimed in Prague given that the two countries have vied for influence there in recent years. As both sides struggled to figure out what the violent uprising would mean, the United States took a cautious approach while Russia embraced the new government and a senior official in Mr. Medvedev’s delegation told reporters that Moscow still wanted an American base in Kyrgyzstan closed. Advertisement But harmony was the message of the day. “When the United States and Russia are not able to work together on big issues, it’s not good for either of our nations, nor is it good for the world,” Mr. Obama said. “Together, we’ve stopped that drift, and proven the benefits of cooperation. Today is an important milestone for nuclear security and nonproliferation, and for U.S.-Russia relations.” Advertisement Mr. Medvedev called the treaty “a truly historic event” that would “open a new page” in Russian-American relations. “What matters most is that this is a win-win situation,” he said. “No one stands to lose from this agreement. I believe that this is a typical feature of our cooperation. Both parties have won.” The Russian signaled support for the American-led drive to impose new sanctions on Iran , saying that Tehran’s nuclear program had flouted international rules. “We cannot turn a blind eye to this,” Mr. Medvedev said, while adding that sanctions “should be smart” and avoid hardship for the Iranian people. Mr. Medvedev said he “outlined our limits for such sanctions” to Mr. Obama in their private talks, without elaborating. Sergei Ryabkov, the deputy Russian foreign minister, said later that Mr. Medvedev supported sanctions “that are targeted, that are tailored,” and opposed an embargo on refined oil products because it would be “a huge shock for the whole society.” The friendly tone stood in contrast to the rupture between Washington and Moscow after Russia’s war with its tiny neighbor of Georgia in 2008, when President George W. Bush shelved a civilian nuclear cooperation agreement in protest and supplied financial aid to the Georgians. Neither president mentioned Georgia in public on Thursday or the broader issue of Russia’s assertiveness with its neighbors. The two played down their quarrel over American plans to build missile defense in Europe , despite recent comments by Russian officials threatening to withdraw from the treaty if the United States pressed too far. And Mr. Obama expressed no public concern about Russian authoritarianism, a topic that routinely flavored discussions during Mr. Bush’s presidency, and even he was sometimes criticized for not raising it more strenuously. Mr. Obama and Mr. Medvedev smiled and whispered with each other as they sat side by side signing the treaty. Mr. Obama called his counterpart a “friend and partner” and said “without his personal efforts and strong leadership, we would not be here today.” For his part, Mr. Medvedev said the two had developed a “very good personal relationship and a very good personal chemistry, as they say.” White House officials described the relationship in effusive terms. “We’re having a real conversation,” said Michael McFaul, the president’s Russia adviser. “We’re not reading talking points.” Robert Gibbs , the White House press secretary, said Mr. Obama “genuinely feels like they can sit down and call each other and work through a series of issues in a very frank and honest way.” Russian officials likewise expressed optimism that was absent from such meetings not long ago. “Our mutual trust was below zero,” said Mikhail Margelov, chairman of the foreign affairs committee in the upper house of Parliament. “Now we have to correct the mistakes of the past and move forward.” Advertisement Under the treaty, if ratified, each side within seven years would be barred from deploying more than 1,550 strategic warheads or 700 launchers. Because of counting rules and past reductions, neither side would have to eliminate large numbers of weapons to meet the new limits. But the treaty re-establishes an inspection regime that lapsed in December and could serve as a foundation for deeper reductions later. The rapprochement worries many in a region once dominated by Moscow. The cover of the influential Czech weekly Reflex showed Mr. Obama kissing Leonid Brezhnev, along with the warning, “dangerous kisses with Moscow.” The leading Polish newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza ran a snide commentary titled “Obama is coming, but it’s no longer our Obama.” Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter. You must select a newsletter to subscribe to. Lubos Dobrovsky, a former Czech defense minister who presided over the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, said he feared that Mr. Obama was appeasing Russia. “This treaty is a diplomatic and military victory for Moscow,” he said in an interview, “and I am not happy that this American defeat is being showcased in Prague.” Hoping to soothe such concerns, Mr. Obama spoke by phone with President Mikheil Saakashvili of Georgia before leaving Washington and then hosted 11 leaders from the region here for a dinner of devil’s fish, scallops and California wine. “He gave us reassurances that we are not in a vacuum, that we are anchored in Europe and NATO , that we belong somewhere,” Prime Minister Jan Fischer of the Czech Republic said in an interview afterward. But history is hard to ignore, he added. “The people of the Czech Republic will be viewing relations with Russia through the rear view mirror, but we need to look through the front screen, which is much larger.” Prime Minister Donald Tusk of Poland told reporters that he asked Mr. Obama directly how the renewed Russian-American ties “may affect the security of countries in the region,” and added that “we received assurances on the part of the United States” that its commitment to its partners here remained undiminished.

"Oil prices could spiral higher in the coming months, says IEA","Further rises would not only hit motorists but chancellor’s hopes of raising fuel duty  Thu 13 Sep 2018 13.51 BST   Last modified on Fri 14 Sep 2018 11.15 BST   The world’s energy watchdog has warned there is a risk of oil prices spiralling higher in the coming months, posing extra costs for drivers and a dilemma for the chancellor, Philip Hammond, as he looks to raise fuel duty. Recent crude prices of $70-$80 a barrel could be tested by the prospect of oil exports from Venezuela and Iran declining, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said. “We are entering a very crucial period for the oil market…. Things are tightening up.” The IEA warning will be unwelcome news for motorists who have already been hit by a series of rises that have taken petrol and diesel prices to four-year highs. In August, the average price for a litre of petrol was 129.67p and 132.33p for diesel, owing to increases in oil prices and a weakened pound. Simon Williams of the RAC said: “Fuel prices are teetering on the brink. If oil supply gets any tighter or the pound gets any weaker against the dollar we could see the price of a litre of fuel climb to very unwelcome heights – potentially close to the record highs of 2012.’” The prospect of higher prices at forecourts also creates a problem for Hammond, who is considering raising fuel duty in the budget to increase public spending . The tax has been frozen since 2011. The chancellor is already facing criticism from Conservative MPs and motoring groups for hinting that a rise is coming. “I do understand that the rise in oil prices and the feed-through that has had to the pump does represent a very real pressure for the motorist, which we will take into account,” he said this week. But Hammond told MPs that while the fuel duty freeze had saved motorists money, it was necessary to look at “the other side of this coin” because the Treasury had missed out on £46bn in lost revenue as a result. The IEA said supply problems in Venezuela and Libya, and the impact on Iran from further US sanctions could cancel out oil cartel Opec’s drive to increase production and ease prices. “If Venezuelan and Iranian exports do continue to fall, markets could tighten and oil prices could rise without offsetting production increases from elsewhere,” the group said. The main oil-producing countries have begun pumping more crude after an agreement in June to raise production, the IEA found, with global output hitting a record level of 100m barrels a day in August. The international benchmark for oil prices, Brent crude, was trading at $78 a barrel on Thursday. Oil market observers at HSBC said this week that the possibility of $100 a barrel was “not out of the question, given the increasing lack of global spare capacity”. Analysts at UBS bank said $100 prices would push up global inflation to 4% compared with 3% at lower prices."
"Iran's Rouhani tells UN: we pose no threat to the world","Julian Borger and  Ed Pilkington New York  Wed 25 Sep 2013 08.32 BST   First published on Wed 25 Sep 2013 08.32 BST   Iran's new president, Hassan Rouhani, declared that "peace is within reach" on Tuesday, in a hotly anticipated speech at the United Nations in which he offered immediate negotiations aimed at removing any "reasonable concerns" over his country's nuclear programme. Rouhani argued that in return, Iran wanted the international community to recognise its right to enrich uranium, the issue that has been at the heart of the diplomatic impasse over the past 11 years. The Iranian president, elected in June, was speaking a few hours Barack Obama had stood at the same podium and pledged to focus his administration's foreign policy in its remaining three years on the Middle East, particularly on reaching a diplomatic settlement in Iran. Obama assigned his secretary of state, John Kerry, to oversee negotiations with Tehran and offered Rouhani an important symbolic gesture, making the first official US acknowledgement of the CIA's well-documented role in the ousting of Iran's democratically-elected government in 1953. But despite the positive gestures a much-anticipated meeting between the two leaders not materialise. The White House said it offered to arrange a discussion in the margins of the general assembly but said that Rouhani's office deemed it was "too complicated". He did not go into details and a meeting with Barack Obama did not materialise . The White House said it offered to arrange a discussion in the margins of the general assembly but said that Rouhani's office deemed it was "too complicated". In his speech however, Rouhani said he had "listened carefully" to Obama address earlier in the day. He concluded that if Washington did not give in to the influence of "warmongers", then the US and Iran "can arrive at a framework to manage our differences". The framework Rouhani suggested for dealing with the stand-off over Iran's nuclear aspirations offered a trade between increased Iranian transparency and international recognition of Iran's right to enrich. "Our national interests make it imperative that we remove any and all reasonable concerns about Iran's peaceful nuclear programme," he said, adding that Iran "is prepared to engage immediately in time-bound and result-oriented talks to build mutual confidence and the removal of mutual uncertainties with full transparency." On the other hand, he said that the country's mastery of the technology had reached such an "industrial scale", and so could not longer be reversed. So the world should instead recognise Iran's basic right to carry out all parts of the nuclear fuel cycle. The vague nature of Rouhani's offer, the accusatory tone of much of the rest of his speech, and the failure to organise a meeting with Obama all served to dampen expectations of an immediate breakthrough. Diplomats and observers at the UN said it was clear that Rouhani's speech was principally aimed at a domestic audience, particularly Iran's supreme leader, Ali Khamenei and the regime's hardliners who are suspicious of Rouhani's charm offensive in the West. In his UN speech earlier in the day , Obama made clear that the US saw the Iranian nuclear programme as a more immediate and serious threat to its core interest. He responded to the overtures of the newly-elected leadership in Tehran by putting Kerry in charge of the coming critical weeks of intense negotiations. "Given President Rouhani's stated commitment to reach an agreement, I am directing John Kerry to pursue this effort with the Iranian government, in close coordination with the European Union, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia and China," the president said. A senior administration official described the move as "a significant elevation" in the status of the talks. It move mirrored Rouhani's decision to put his own foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, in charge of the talks from the Iranian side, breaking from the practice of the past eight years of abortive negotiations of assigning them to senior officials. The foreign ministers of all seven countries are due to meet for the first time at the UN on Thursday. "Directing secretary Kerry to lead this, signals that the negotiations may be elevated to the foreign minister level, which would be very good news," said Trita Parsi, the head of the National Iranian American Council, and the author of a book on US-Iranian negotiations, A Single Roll of the Dice. "This means that far greater political will is being invested into the diplomatic process, which in turn increases the cost of failure. That is exactly what is needed to overcome the political obstacles to a deal." Obama acknowledged the difficulties ahead. "The roadblocks may prove to be too great, but I firmly believe a diplomatic path must be tested," he said. Obama offered Rouhani an important symbolic gesture, making the first official US acknowledgement of the CIA's well-documented role in the ousting of Iran's democratically elected government in 1953. "This mistrust has deep roots. Iranians have long complained of a history of US interference in their affairs, and America's role in overthrowing an Iranian government during the cold war," he said. The reference to the CIA's part in the ousting of Mohammad Mosaddegh, Iran's democratically elected leader, marked a first official admission of that role, and represented an important gesture to Rouhani. It will be seen in Iran as a diplomatic victory and belated acknowledgement of a long-festering Iranian sense of injustice. The coup, supported by both the US and the UK, paved the way for the dictatorship of the shah, and then the 1979 Islamic revolution against it. "I don't believe this difficult history can be overcome overnight. The suspicions run too deep. But I do believe if we can resolve the issue of Iran's nuclear programme that can be a major step," Obama said. The US president expressed optimism about this week's talks. "We should be able to achieve a resolution that respects the rights of the Iranian people, while giving the world confidence that the Iranian programme is peaceful. To succeed, conciliatory words will have to be matched by actions that are transparent and verifiable." Thursday's talks involve Rouhani's foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, Kerry, the UK foreign secretary, William Hague and foreign ministers from Russia, China, France and Germany. Much will depend on how far Rouhani is prepared to go to remove what he described as the "reasonable concerns" about Iran's nuclear intentions. If that involves Iran's acceptance of strict limits on the degree of enrichment allowed and a stricter regime of inspections, there may room for a deal. Javad Zarif used Tehran's softened language on ABC's This Week but affirmed Iran's right to enrich was 'not negotiable' Twitter account said to be run by Rouhani aides recounted friendly conversation with US president – before tweets were erased"
"The Energy Industry Plots a Complex Path in the Midst of Disruption","Advertisement Supported by Oil and Money By  Stanley Reed Many factors have turned to push up oil prices. OPEC’s policy of supply management is finally having the intended effect, drawing down global inventories. Saudi Arabia recently doubled down on its pledge to curb supplies by announcing it was slashing exports further. Meanwhile, the unprecedented level of cooperation between Russia and Saudi Arabia looks set to continue in 2018, reaffirmed during King Salman’s recent visit to Moscow. Geopolitical tensions have also threatened oil supplies. Turkey’s threat to retaliate against the recent Kurdish independence vote is one example. President Trump’s likely decertification of the Iran nuclear deal raises the risk that Iranian exports will again be curtailed. And Venezuelan oil output is falling. At the same time, demand growth is surging, rising 2.3 million barrels per day year-on-year in the second quarter. A key uncertainty is whether oil demand growth remains strong, or slows in the face of slower G.D.P. growth and the gradual penetration of electric vehicles and stronger policies to address pollution and climate change. The closer ties between Saudi Arabia and Russia, rooted in unprecedented oil market cooperation, marked one of the most significant geopolitical developments of 2017. Since Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman’s visit two years ago, there have been a raft of energy, infrastructure and military deals between the two top oil producers. Saudi has signaled that Russian cooperation is key to its continued strong efforts to prop up prices. Russian participation in the supply agreement seemed uncertain as Russian output was poised to rise, but recent signals by Vladimir Putin suggest he may stick with the agreement through 2018. Coming Russian elections combined with the adverse impact on the economy of the oil price collapse give Putin greater incentive to keep the supply agreement from unraveling. In 2018, a game of chicken may play out, with Russia looking to gradually boost supply, but not if it believes Saudi will abandon course as a result. American exports of L.N.G. exports are set to rise sharply by the end of the decade. These exports can make America an energy superpower. Unlike coal or oil, which can be moved easily between ports, exporting natural gas has been a far trickier proposition, usually requiring pipelines between buyers and sellers. Moreover, L.N.G. comes with unique energy security risks for gas-consuming countries, since suppliers can (and have) cut off gas flows. But U.S. gas is linked to a hub price and has no destination restrictions. That means more competition, liquidity and supply diversity, and that will make global gas markets more flexible, efficient and secure. Europe, in particular, will be more able to implement its Energy Union package to reduce its vulnerability to Russian gas dependence through market integration, interconnectivity and diversification. The shale boom has been one of the strongest buttresses supporting the recovery of the U.S. economy following the Great Recession, helping to lower energy prices for businesses and consumers and shrink the U.S. energy trade deficit. And cheap natural gas has been the primary reason for the recent decline in U.S. coal consumption, with concomitant environmental benefits. Nonetheless, a 2016 Gallup poll found public opposition to fracking on the rise. Shale development can have disruptive impacts on communities and raises risks that must be mitigated through industry best practices and strong regulatory oversight. Industry and regulators need to work together to address legitimate concerns, like the climate change impacts of methane leakage and the seismic risks from wastewater disposal. We are going to be relying on oil and gas for decades to come, but technology and policy pushes have raised the possibility that peak oil demand may occur far sooner than many believed possible. In addition to pollution concerns, China is pushing aggressively on E.V.s, seeing an opportunity to dominate an emerging industrial sector of the future. Still, it takes time to convert the vehicle fleet, and there remain open questions about the pace of innovation and whether the long-term targets to eliminate the internal combustion engine will be backed by real policies. Moreover, passenger cars represent only one-quarter of world oil demand, so electrifying personal transport alone would not mean the end of the oil age. Oil demand is set to continue rising in heavy-duty freight, aviation and petrochemicals. The Trump administration has laid out an ambitious deregulatory agenda to unleash American “energy dominance,” but those steps are unlikely to significantly change the outlook for U.S. oil, gas and coal production and exports. Markets will matter far more than policy. Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement damages U.S. international credibility and diplomatic relations, cedes U.S. leadership in developing the clean energy technologies of tomorrow and weakens a framework to ratchet up ambition across countries to address the growing threat of climate change. At the same time, as the agreement consisted of voluntary national contributions, the Trump administration would have been free to curb U.S. climate policies even if the country had not withdrawn.

"U.S. Enriches Companies Defying Its Policy on Iran","Advertisement By JO BECKER and RON NIXON MARCH 6, 2010  The federal government has awarded more than $107 billion in contract payments, grants and other benefits over the past decade to foreign and multinational American companies while they were doing business in Iran , despite Washington’s efforts to discourage investment there, records show . That includes nearly $15 billion paid to companies that defied American sanctions law by making large investments that helped Iran develop its vast oil and gas reserves. For years, the United States has been pressing other nations to join its efforts to squeeze the Iranian economy, in hopes of reining in Tehran’s nuclear ambitions. Now, with the nuclear standoff hardening and Iran rebuffing American diplomatic outreach, the Obama administration is trying to win a tough new round of United Nations sanctions. But a New York Times analysis of federal records, company reports and other documents shows that both the Obama and Bush administrations have sent mixed messages to the corporate world when it comes to doing business in Iran, rewarding companies whose commercial interests conflict with American security goals. Advertisement Many of those companies are enmeshed in the most vital elements of Iran’s economy. More than two-thirds of the government money went to companies doing business in Iran’s energy industry — a huge source of revenue for the Iranian government and a stronghold of the increasingly powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, a primary focus of the Obama administration’s proposed sanctions because it oversees Iran’s nuclear and missile programs. Advertisement Other companies are involved in auto manufacturing and distribution, another important sector of the Iranian economy with links to the Revolutionary Guards. One supplied container ship motors to IRISL , a government-owned shipping line that was subsequently blacklisted by the United States for concealing military cargo. Beyond $102 billion in United States government contract payments since 2000 — to do everything from building military housing to providing platinum to the United States Mint — the companies and their subsidiaries have reaped a variety of benefits. They include nearly $4.5 billion in loans and loan guarantees from the Export-Import Bank , a federal agency that underwrites the export of American goods and services, and more than $500 million in grants for work that includes cancer research and the turning of agricultural byproducts into fuel. In addition, oil and gas companies that have done business in Iran have over the years won lucrative drilling leases for close to 14 million acres of offshore and onshore federal land. In recent months, a number of companies have decided to pull out of Iran, because of a combination of pressure by the United States and other Western governments,  “terrorism free” divestment campaigns by shareholders and the difficulty of doing business with Iran’s government. And several oil and gas companies are holding off on new investment, waiting to see what shape new sanctions may assume. The Obama administration points to that record, saying that it has successfully pressed allied governments and even reached out directly to corporate officials to dissuade investment in Iran, particularly in the energy industry. In addition, an American effort over many years to persuade banks to leave the country has isolated Iran from much of the international financial system, making it more difficult to do deals there. “We are very aggressive, using a range of tools,” said Denis McDonough ,   chief of staff to the National Security Council . The government can, and does, bar American companies from most types of trade with Iran, under a broad embargo that has been in place since the 1990s. But as The Times’s analysis illustrates, multiple administrations have struggled diplomatically, politically and practically to exert American authority over companies outside the embargo’s reach — foreign companies and the foreign subsidiaries of American ones. Advertisement Indeed, of the 74 companies The Times identified as doing business with both the United States government and Iran, 49 continue to do business there with no announced plans to leave. One of the government’s most powerful tools, at least on paper, to influence the behavior of companies beyond the jurisdiction of the embargo is the Iran Sanctions Act, devised to punish foreign companies that invest more than $20 million in a given year to develop Iran’s oil and gas fields. But in the 14 years since the law was passed, the government has never enforced it, in part for fear of angering America’s allies. That has given rise to situations like the one involving the South Korean engineering giant Daelim Industrial , which in 2007 won a $700 million contract to upgrade an Iranian oil refinery. According to the Congressional Research Service, the deal appeared to violate the Iran Sanctions Act, meaning Daelim could have faced a range of punishments, including denial of federal contracts. That is because the law covers not only direct investments, such as the purchase of shares and deals that yield royalties, but also contracts similar to Daelim’s to manage oil and gas development projects. But in 2009 the United States Army awarded the company a $111 million contract to build housing in a military base in South Korea . Just months later, Daelim, which disputes that its contracts violated the letter of the law, announced a new $600 million deal to help develop the South Pars gas field in Iran. Now, though, frustration over Iran’s intransigence has spawned a growing, if still piecemeal, movement to more effectively use the power of the government purse to turn companies away from investing there. Nineteen states — including New York, California and Florida — have rules that bar or discourage their pension funds from investing in companies that do certain types of business in Iran. Congress is considering legislation that would have the federal government follow suit, by mandating that companies that invest in Iran’s energy industry be denied federal contracts. The provision is modeled on an existing law dealing with war-torn Sudan . Obama administration officials, while indicating that they were open to the idea, called it only one variable in a complex equation. Right now, the president’s priority is on breaking down Chinese resistance to the new United Nations sanctions, which apply across borders and are aimed squarely at entities that support Iran’s nuclear program . Advertisement But Representative Ron Klein, a Florida Democrat who wrote the contracting provision moving through Congress with the help of a lobbying group called United Against Nuclear Iran, said it offered a way forward with or without international agreement. “We need to send a strong message to corporations that we’re not going to continue to allow them to economically enable the Iranian government to continue to do what they have been doing,” Mr. Klein said. Sending a strong message was Congress’s intention when it passed the Iran Sanctions Act in 1996. The law gives the president a menu of possible punishments he can choose to levy against offending companies. Not only do they risk losing federal contracts, but they can also be prevented from receiving Export-Import Bank loans, obtaining American bank loans over $10 million in a given year, exporting their goods to the United States, purchasing licensed American military technology and, in the case of financial firms, serving as a primary dealer in United States government bonds or as a repository for government funds. Congress is now considering expanding its purview to a broader array of energy-related activities, including selling gasoline to Iran, which despite its vast oil and gas reserves has antiquated refineries that leave it heavily dependent on imports. From the beginning, though, the law proved difficult to enforce. European allies howled that it constituted an improper attempt to apply American law in other countries. Exercising an option to waive the law in the name of national security, the Clinton administration in 1998 declined to penalize the first violator — a consortium led by the French oil company TotalFina, now known as Total . The administration also indicated that it would waive future penalties against European companies, winning in return tougher European export controls on technology that Iran could convert to military use. Stuart E. Eizenstat , who as the deputy Treasury secretary handled those negotiations, said the law let Iran “exploit divisions between the U.S. and our European allies.” Advertisement Waiving it, though, was followed by additional investments in Iran — and more government largesse for the companies making them.

In 1999, for instance, Royal Dutch Shell signed an $800 million deal to develop two Iranian oil fields. Since then, Shell has won federal contract payments and grants totaling more than $11 billion, mostly for providing fuel to the American military, as well as $200 million in Export-Import loan guarantee and drilling rights to federal lands, records show. Shell has a second Iranian development deal pending, but officials say they are awaiting the results of a feasibility study. In the meantime, the company continues to receive payments from Iran for its 1999 investment and sells gasoline and lubricants there. Records show Shell is one of seven companies that challenged the Iran Sanctions Act and received federal benefits. John R. Bolton , who dealt with Iran as an under secretary of state and United Nations ambassador in the Bush administration, said failing to enforce the law by punishing such companies both sent “a signal to the Iranians that we’re not serious” and undercut Washington’s credibility when it did threaten action. Mr. Bolton recalled what happened in 2004 when he suggested to the Japanese ambassador that Japan ’s state-controlled oil exploration company, Inpex, might be penalized for a $2 billion investment in the Azadegan field in Iran. “The Japanese ambassador said, ‘Well, that’s interesting. How come you’ve never sanctioned a European Union company?’ ” Mr. Bolton recounted. Inpex was never penalized, though several years later it decided to reduce its stake in the Iranian project. And to Mr. Bolton’s chagrin, the Bush administration did not act on reports about other such investments, neither waiving the law nor penalizing violators. Recently, after 50 lawmakers from both parties complained to President Obama about the lack of enforcement and sent him a list of companies that apparently violated the law , the State Department announced a preliminary investigation. Officials said that they were looking at 27 deals, and that while some appeared to have been “carefully constructed” to get around the letter of the law, they had identified a number of problematic cases and were focusing on companies still active in Iran. Among the companies on the list Congress sent to the State Department is the Brazilian state-controlled energy conglomerate Petrobras, which last year received a $2 billion Export-Import Bank loan to develop an oil reserve off the coast of Rio de Janeiro . The loan offers a case study in the competing interests officials must confront when it comes to the Iran Sanctions Act. Advertisement Despite repeated American entreaties, Petrobras had previously invested $100 million to explore Iran’s offshore oil prospects in the Persian Gulf. But the Export-Import Bank loan could help create American jobs, since Petrobras would use the money to buy goods and services from American companies. Perhaps more important, it could help develop a source of oil outside the Middle East . After The Times inquired about the loan, bank officials said that they asked for and received a letter of assurance from Petrobras that it had finished its work in Iran. A senior White House official, in a Nov. 13 e-mail message, said that while it was the administration’s policy to warn companies against such investments, “ Brazil is an important U.S. trading partner and our discussions with them are ongoing.” But if the administration hoped that the loan would bring Brazil in line with its objectives in Iran, it would soon prove mistaken. On Nov. 23, Iran’s president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , visited Brazil , and the two countries agreed to share technical expertise on energy projects. Iranian officials said they might offer Petrobras additional incentives for further investment. The visit infuriated American officials, who felt it undercut efforts to press Iran on its nuclear program while lending international legitimacy to the Iranian president. Brazil’s relationship with Iran has also complicated American maneuvering at the United Nations, where Brazil holds a rotating seat on the Security Council. Just last week, Brazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva , restated his opposition to the administration’s sanctions proposal, warning, “It is not prudent to push Iran against a wall.” Carter Lawson, the Export-Import Bank’s deputy general counsel, acknowledged that Mr. Ahmadinejad’s visit was “problematic for us, and it raised our antenna.” He said that since December the bank had been operating under a new budget rule requiring borrowers to certify that they had no continuing operations in Iran’s energy industry, and was carefully monitoring Petrobras’s activities. In the meantime, Petrobras’s Tehran office remains open. And Diogo Almeida, the acting economic attaché at the Brazilian Embassy in Iran, said that while Petrobras was currently assessing how much it could invest in Iran, given the huge discovery off Rio de Janeiro, company officials were in active discussions with the Iranian government and were interested in pursuing new business. Advertisement For all the American rules and focus, there is still plenty of room for companies to profit in crucial areas of Iran’s economy without fear of reprisal or loss of United States government business. Auto companies doing business in Iran, for instance, received $7.3 billion in federal contracts over the past 10 years. Among them was Mazda , whose cars in Iran are assembled by a company called the Bahman Group. A 45 percent share in Bahman is held by the Sepah Cooperative Foundation, a large investment fund linked to the Revolutionary Guards, according to Iranian news accounts and a 2009 RAND Corporation report prepared for the Defense Department. A Mazda spokesman declined to comment, saying the company was unaware of the links. Even companies based in the United States, including some of the biggest federal contractors, can invest in Iran through foreign subsidiaries run independently by non-Americans. Honeywell , the aviation and aerospace company, has received nearly $13 billion in federal contracts since 2005. That year it acquired Universal Oil Products, whose British subsidiary is working on a project to expand gasoline production at the Arak refinery in Iran. Universal recently received a $25 million federal grant for a clean-energy project in Hawaii . In a statement, Honeywell said it had told the State Department in January of 2009 that while it was fulfilling its Arak contract, it would not undertake new projects in Iran. Ingersoll Rand , another American company with foreign subsidiaries, says it is evaluating its “minor” business in Iran in light of the political climate. But for now, according to a spokesman, Paul Dickard, it continues to sell air-compression systems with a “wide variety of applications,” including in the oil and gas industries and in nuclear power plants. Senator Byron L. Dorgan , a North Dakota Democrat, tried to close the foreign subsidiary loophole after a furor erupted in 2004 over Halliburton , former Vice President Dick Cheney ’s old company, which had used a Cayman Islands subsidiary to sell oil-field services to Iran. But he said he was unable to overcome business opposition. William A. Reinsch, president of the National Foreign Trade Council, lobbied against Mr. Dorgan’s bill and has opposed other unilateral sanctions. He argues that their futility can be seen in the intransigence of the Iranian government and the way American oil companies have simply been replaced by foreign competitors. Moreover, many foreign companies with business interests in Iran are also large American employers; deny them federal contracts and other benefits, Mr. Reinsch said, “and it’s those workers who will pay the price.” But Hans Sandberg, senior vice president of Atlas Copco, which is based in Sweden , offered a different perspective. Atlas Copco ’s sales of mining and construction equipment to Iran are dwarfed by its American business, including military contracts. If forced to choose, he said: “It would be no problem. We wouldn’t trade with Iran.” An article on Sunday about United States government contracts and other benefits received by companies doing business in Iran misstated the date Honeywell, the aviation and aerospace company, notified the State Department that, while a British subsidiary would finish a refinery project in Iran, it would not undertake new projects there. It was January 2009, not last January. Eric Owles contributed reporting.

"Pax Americana Is Over","Advertisement Supported by By  Roger Cohen The thing about “The Apprentice” is you could turn it off. Now we get to watch Donald Trump all the time. There’s nowhere to hide. I was in Papua New Guinea recently. His name kept coming up. The appointments cascade at reality-show speed. Rick Perry to head the Energy Department whose name he couldn’t remember when he wanted to dismantle it! Scott Pruitt to head the Environmental Protection Agency he’s spent the last several years suing! A fierce critic of worker protections to be secretary of labor! An oil executive, Rex Tillerson, whose company owns drilling rights on 63.7 million acres in Russia to handle dealings with Vladimir Putin when Moscow just infiltrated the American election process! Next up: Kim Jong-un as press secretary, Cruella de Vil to head the Humane Society, and Mata Hari to lead the Cybersecurity National Action Plan. All this is further evidence of Trump’s genius. He is master of the Art of Disorientation. He’s turned Americans into cartoon characters whose heads are always spinning. How the president-elect must laugh at all the fact-based journalism (ghastly tautological phrase) dedicated to disproving things he never believed and can’t remember anyway. The disoriented are more inclined to seek saviors. Trump knows that. He’s been right up to now. Before anyone else, he was onto the way that direct democracy through social media has buried representative democracy. One minute it’s “millions” of illegal votes for Hillary Clinton; then dangling little Mitt Romney; then being too smart for intelligence briefings. Let’s face it, folks. We have no idea what is about to happen in the White House or at White House North in Midtown Manhattan. We are in whatever territory lies beyond unknown unknowns. But some things may be emerging from the fog. Trump is not interested in the rules-based international order the United States has spent the last seven decades building and defending. His foreign policy will be transactional. If it profits America, fine. If not, forget about it. Trump’s United States will be agnostic on human rights, freedom and democracy. America, suspending moral judgment, will behave a lot more like China on the world stage. Except that’s a little unfair to China. The Chinese do understand the benefits of free trade (and they certainly understand that when Trump rips up the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a strategic plan to offset Chinese power couched in an economic arrangement, Beijing grows stronger). Because they often can’t breathe, the Chinese also understand, in a way Trump does not, the importance of fighting climate change. As an exercise, I’ve been trying to imagine Trump saying something — anything — about the heinous destruction of Aleppo by the forces of Putin and Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. I’ve been trying to imagine what Trump might say about the brutal crimes against Syrian civilians in the beleaguered eastern sector of that once glorious city. I came up blank. He did say it was “sad.” He said he’d ask Persian Gulf nations to put up money for “safe zones.” Good luck with that as the war nears its sixth year. I guess that’s one advantage of the amorality in which Trump traffics: You may as well refrain from any moral stand because nobody will believe you anyway. (To be fair, Syria is a huge stain on the Obama presidency.) It would be obscene for Trump to speak of principles. That is a problem. America is an idea. Strip freedom, human rights, democracy and the rule of law from what the United States represents to the world and America itself is gutted. Of course, realpolitik driven by interests is integral to American foreign policy, but a valueless approach of the kind Trump proposes leaves the world rudderless. Pax Americana is over. It had a good run. A Putin-Trump alliance at the service of the butcher Assad — combined with the undoing of the military alliances, trade pacts, political integration and legal framework of the postwar order — constitutes its death knell. Maybe everything will work out fine with a nuclear South Korea, a nuclear Japan, Baltic States exposed to the whims of Putin, the United States Embassy moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a flimsy NATO abjured by America, and swaggering Texan oil men running things while Trump takes time off in New York. I doubt it. The embassy move alone could ignite widespread violence. David Friedman, the man Trump has nominated as ambassador to Israel, seems certain to stoke the fires. Trump’s plans are full of contradictions he hasn’t begun to address. He’s against the Iran nuclear deal although of course he’s never read it. But Putin is for it. Trump wants to eliminate the Islamic State. So does Russia, whose ally in Syria is Iran. Trump wants an America-first, business-driven policy. Boeing just signed a big deal with Iran. So maybe Trump ends up doing the only sane thing: preserving a nuclear deal that’s in everyone’s interest. Who knows? Markets think they do. They love Trump. That’s because Trump believes big guys should take everything and little guys should take nothing. But wasn’t it the little guys who voted for Trump? That’s funny, really it is. Or as he would put it, “Sad.” You can follow me on Twitter ( @NYTimesCohen ) or join me on Facebook . Advertisement"
"Obama’s Message to Iran Is Opening Bid in Diplomatic Drive","Advertisement By HELENE COOPER and DAVID E. SANGER MARCH 20, 2009  WASHINGTON — The groundbreaking message to Iran that President Obama delivered by videotape on Friday was part of a strategy intended to emphasize a positive message to Iran in the prelude to that nation’s presidential election this summer, according to administration officials and European diplomats. Among other measures being weighed are a direct communication from Mr. Obama to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , Iran’s supreme leader, and an end to a prohibition on direct contacts between junior American diplomats and their Iranian counterparts around the world, the officials and diplomats said. At least for now, the American strategy calls for an emphasis on diplomacy, in part out of concern that a more confrontational message that focused on Iran’s nuclear program might prove counterproductive in the political heat of the Iranian election season. The officials said that Mr. Obama had set aside for the next few months a quest for more punitive sanctions aimed at Iran. After three decades of a freeze in American-Iranian relations, it appeared significant that Mr. Obama directed his comments not just to the Iranian people but to Iran’s leaders, and that he referred to Iran as “the Islamic Republic,” apparently indicating a willingness to deal with the current clerical government. Advertisement Iranian officials responded cautiously to Mr. Obama’s message. Administration officials say they have not given up on tougher sanctions for Iran, but have concluded that sending a positive message now offers more chance of success. One reason is that Russia in particular appears unlikely to support tougher sanctions until Mr. Obama demonstrates that he has first gone significantly further than President Bush did to engage Iran. Advertisement The administration’s first face-to-face encounter with Iranian officials could come in 10 days, when Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton will attend a conference on Afghanistan in The Hague . Iran is expected to send a delegation, and a senior administration official said Mrs. Clinton would probably greet Iranian officials on the sidelines. The video from Mr. Obama that was released by the White House at 12:01 a.m. on Friday, with subtitles in Persian, coincided with the Iranian festival of Nowruz, a 12-day holiday that marks the new year in Iran. “In this season of new beginnings, I would like to speak clearly to Iran’s leaders,” Mr. Obama said. “My administration is now committed to diplomacy that addresses the full range of issues before us, and to pursuing constructive ties among the United States , Iran and the international community. This process will not be advanced by threats.” The Israeli government also sent a New Year’s message to the Iranian people on Friday, although administration officials and Israeli officials insisted that the gestures were not part of a coordinated plan. “I know we notified allies about our message last evening,” the White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs , said, but he added that he did not know if Israel had also notified the United States ahead of time. Some experts said the fact that the American message was sent on the same day as Israel’s had the potential to dilute the effect of Mr. Obama’s message, by linking it to Israel, whose government has been much more hostile toward Iran. In his own message, Mr. Obama made a point of saying that “the United States wants the Islamic Republic of Iran to take its rightful place in the community of nations.” The reference to Iran as an “Islamic Republic,” and the direct statement about not threatening Iran, diplomats said, offered a first clear signal from the Obama administration that it would not pursue a change of government in Iran.

Indyk , a former United States ambassador to Israel and author of “Innocent Abroad: An Intimate Account of American Diplomacy in the Middle East .” “The message is dripping with sincerity and directly addresses one of the things they are most concerned about,” he said. Advertisement Mr. Obama went so far as to quote the medieval Persian poet Saadi. “The children of Adam are limbs to each other, having been created of one essence,” he said. In Iran, officials were tepid in their initial response, saying that Mr. Obama’s message must be followed up with concrete actions to address past grievances, like the downing of an Iranian airliner in 1988. Ali Akbar Javanfekr, a high-ranking adviser to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , praised the effort to reach out to Iranians but said that Iran wanted more than words. “This cannot only be done by us, we cannot simply forget what the U.S. did to our nation,” he said. “They need to perceive what wrong orientation they had and make serious efforts to make up for it.” But Karim Sadjadpour, an Iranian-American expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said that Mr. Obama’s message would force hard-line Iranian officials — like Mr. Ahmadinejad — to put up or shut up on prospects for better relations with the United States. “What this message does is, it puts the hard-liners in a difficult position, because where the Bush administration united disparate Iranian political leaders against a common threat, what Obama is doing is accentuating the cleavages in Iran,” Mr. Sadjadpour said. “It makes the hard-liners look increasingly like they are the impediment.” European diplomats applauded the move, but expressed dismay that President Shimon Peres of Israel followed with his own message to the Iranian people. “This is a real shame because the key effect should be Obama, and this dilutes from that,” said one European diplomat, speaking on the condition of anonymity under normal diplomatic rules. Israeli officials have told the White House that by the end of the year, at the latest, Iran will have everything it needs if it decides to produce a nuclear weapon. The officials have hinted that Israel will take unilateral action against Iran if they believe Mr. Obama’s diplomacy is going nowhere. Israel has also been pushing the Obama administration to consider new, tougher sanctions. Among those they advocate are a cutoff of refined gasoline to Iran — a sanction that Mr. Obama himself discussed as a last resort during last year’s campaign — and full inspection of all ships leaving Iran, to make sure they are not carrying weapons. For the Obama administration, time for diplomacy may be short. Iran appears to have solved many of the technological problems that hampered its enrichment of uranium. Today its centrifuges appear to be running at high efficiency, according to reports by the International Atomic Energy Agency . It has already produced roughly the amount of uranium to make, with further enrichment, enough fuel for a single nuclear bomb. Mark Landler contributed reporting.

"As Britain Closes Embassies, Iran’s Isolation Could Complicate Nuclear Issue","Advertisement By JOHN F. BURNS NOV. 30, 2011  LONDON — With Britain ’s decision to close its vandalized embassy in Tehran on Wednesday and expel all Iranian diplomats from London, Iran appears to have moved a major step closer to international pariah status. That isolation could complicate efforts by Western governments to halt what they have identified as Iran’s covert efforts to acquire nuclear weapons , according to diplomats and others who monitor Iranian affairs. Although the British Embassy in Tehran has long been denounced by many Iranians as “a nest of spies,” diplomats say that Britain’s maintenance of that mission through much of the 30-year period when the United States has been absent has provided a useful bridge for diplomatic contacts on the nuclear issue, even if they have been mostly unproductive. Foreign Secretary William Hague noted in announcing the decision to close the embassies in Tehran and London that diplomatic relations had not been ruptured altogether, as they were for 18 months after Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued his notorious fatwa calling for the killing of the British novelist Salman Rushdie over the publication of Mr. Rushdie’s “Satanic Verses” in 1989. Instead, Mr. Hague said, Britain was reducing ties to “the lowest level consistent” with having a diplomatic relationship at all — a formulation British officials said was linked, in part, to the need for continuing contacts with Tehran on its nuclear programs. At the same time, Britain emphasized the broad international support it had received over the storming of its embassy, and noted the additional pressure that the event could place on the Tehran leadership. Along with strong backing from Washington , Mr. Hague said, Britain had received messages of support from Russia and China — veto-wielding members of the Security Council that have so far blocked further United Nations sanctions over the nuclear dispute. Other nations that Mr. Hague commended were France and Turkey , which used their missions in Tehran to help evacuate Britain’s diplomats from the Iranian capital within 24 hours of the Tuesday attack. Advertisement President Nicolas Sarkozy of France used a cabinet meeting in Paris on Wednesday to condemn “the scandalous attack” on the British mission, according to French officials, and France’s budget minister, Valérie Pécresse, said the 27-nation European Union should consider an embargo on Iran’s oil or a freeze of its central bank holdings in Europe . France, Germany and the Netherlands all announced the withdrawal of their ambassadors, and Norway said it was closing its embassy “as a precaution.” Italy said it was evaluating whether to keep its diplomatic presence in Tehran, and Austria ’s foreign minister, Michael Spindelegger, said Iran had placed itself “outside the framework of international law.” Advertisement Some experts on Iran cautioned against allowing international opprobrium for the Tehran leadership to build to the point where Iran might abandon caution. “Let’s hope the crisis does not spiral out of control,” Ervand Abrahamian, an Iranian-born historian at the City University of New York , said in an e-mailed response to questions about the embassy assault. The embassy intrusion came against a backdrop of what Iran experts have called an increasingly bitter rift between factions of the Iranian leadership over a variety of issues, including the nuclear dispute with the West. Some expressed concern that a harsh Western response to the attack could embolden the militant faction associated with Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , the supreme leader, including men who control fiercely political paramilitary units like the Republican Guards and the Basij , in their power struggle with Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , the president. Mr. Abrahamian said that the Khamenei faction may have decided to strike at Britain after events in recent months that many in Iran have seen as part of a covert plan to destroy Iran’s nuclear aspirations. These events, he said, included the assassination of three nuclear scientists, computer-based sabotage of uranium enrichment centrifuges and a devastating explosion at a military base west of Tehran a few weeks ago that killed the general who pioneered Iran’s missile development. With no American or Israeli Embassy in Tehran, Mr. Abrahamian said, British diplomatic installations might have been seen as “obvious targets” — all the more so, he suggested, after Britain’s decision last month, in response to a report by the International Atomic Energy Agency raising new concerns about the possible military applications of the nuclear program, to order all Britain-based credit and financial institutions to cease trading with Iran’s banks . “Some sectors of the Iranian government — especially the Republican Guards — would have known about the impending attack on the embassy compound and would have turned a blind eye,” he said. Britain’s response was announced to a restive House of Commons 24 hours after scores of protesters stormed the sprawling British Embassy compound in the heart of Tehran and a diplomatic residential enclave in the Alborz hills of Tehran. Although all of Britain’s diplomats and local Iranian employees were accounted for by nightfall on Tuesday, many news media accounts of the attack in Britain raised the specter of the tumultuous, 444-day occupation of the United States Embassy in the Iranian capital that began the spiral of Iran’s estrangement more than 30 years ago. Advertisement Mr. Hague waited until all of Britain’s diplomats were out of Iran before announcing the closing of the London and Tehran embassies, and giving the House of Commons his own outraged account of the assault. Calling it “a breach of international responsibilities of which any nation should be ashamed,” he set an unusually tight deadline of 48 hours for the Iranian Embassy in London’s upscale Kensington neighborhood to be closed and for all Iranian diplomats to vacate the country. Protesters ransacked the British Embassy in Tehran. Brushing aside an Iranian Foreign Ministry apology on Tuesday disavowing the attack, Mr. Hague identified the protesters as members of the Basij, an extremist youth militia and a shock force often unleashed by militant elements in Tehran’s religious hierarchy to suppress street protests or attack opponents. “We should be clear from the outset that this is an organization controlled by elements of the Iranian regime,” he said. Television images on Tuesday showed scores of intruders who had forced their way into the British Embassy shouting, “Death to England !” They were burning Union Jacks torn from flagstaffs and tossing sheaves of purloined documents out of windows. Mr. Hague said the intruders had set fire to the embassy’s main office building, destroyed furniture, stolen the staff’s personal possessions, and gone on to “vandalize and loot” the ambassador’s residence and other staff accommodations before Iranian police officers escorted them outside. Mr. Hague excoriated the Tehran government. He acknowledged growing tensions between Britain and Iran over the nuclear issue, saying that Britain had been foremost among advocates of tightened international sanctions after the report released Nov. 8 by the International Atomic Energy Agency, which expressed, as Mr. Hague noted, “deep and increasing concern” about the Iranian nuclear program and its “possible military dimensions.” “But we should be absolutely clear that no difficulty in relations can ever excuse in any way or under any circumstances the failure to protect diplomatic staff and diplomatic premises,” he said. “Iran is a country where opposition leaders are under house arrest, more than 500 people have been executed so far this year, and where genuine protest is ruthlessly stamped on. The idea that the Iranian authorities could not have protected our embassy or that this could have taken place without some degree of regime consent is fanciful.” Alan Cowell and Ravi Somaiya contributed reporting from London, and Artin Afkhami from Boston.

"Three Climate Updates You Might Have Missed (and One We Did, Too)","Advertisement Supported by Climate Fwd: By  Brad Plumer , Lisa Friedman and John Schwartz This week, we’re talking about the surprises hidden in the spending bill; one thing that the president’s new hires have in common; and a court hearing on climate that we didn’t witness. By  Brad Plumer Last week, lawmakers in Washington took a significant step toward addressing climate change. They just didn’t call it that. Buried in the $1.3 trillion spending bill passed by Congress and grudgingly signed by President Trump were surprisingly large increases in funding for clean energy programs at the Department of Energy. The Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, which has helped reduce the cost of solar power, got a 14 percent bump. The Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, which funds long-shot technologies like algae biofuels , got a 16 percent increase. The Office of Nuclear Energy got a 19 percent increase. The bill was seen as a repudiation of Mr. Trump’s budget requests. The president, for instance, had asked lawmakers to eliminate the advanced projects agency, saying that such research was best left to the private sector. But even Republicans balked. If anything, that political fight obscured the magnitude of what happened. Tarak Shah, a former chief of staff to the under secretary for science and energy, pointed out that at the Paris climate conference in 2015, President Barack Obama set a goal of doubling federal investment in clean energy research . At the time, that seemed impossible. But during the Trump era, Congress has essentially put the country one-fifth of the way there. The spending bill, Mr. Shah said, is “absolutely huge for energy innovation.” (For more on why experts think such innovation is crucial for tackling climate change, see this article .) One notable dynamic here: A number of Republicans who don’t typically talk about global warming have nonetheless been eager to support clean energy research in recent years. “The one thing we do better than any country in the world is innovation through research,” said Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, at an advanced projects agency conference this month. “We must be careful not to lose this advantage.” It’s a story we’ve seen repeatedly of late. When the solar and wind industries warned last year that the tax overhaul bill would cripple renewable energy investment, Republicans like Senator Rob Portman of Ohio stepped in . Mr. Portman’s state is a major manufacturer of wind turbine components and has more than 100,000 jobs in clean energy industries. Climate policy experts would note that cutting greenhouse gas emissions will require a lot more than a few billion dollars in research. But as industries like wind and solar have expanded, they’ve acquired significant political clout. So far, at least, that’s made it harder for even the most committed climate change denialists in Washington to roll back clean energy programs. By  Lisa Friedman Fossil fuel supporters this week said they were excited by President Trump’s recent wave of firings and hirings. John R. Bolton, Larry Kudlow and Mike Pompeo — tapped, respectively, to be Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, chief economic adviser and secretary of state — all are staunch critics of the Paris Agreement. Energy industry leaders said they were confident the three were far more likely than their predecessors — H.R. McMaster, Gary D. Cohn and Rex W. Tillerson — to ensure that the president keeps his promise of withdrawing the United States from the global climate change accord. “The folks coming in are certainly much less interested in seeing a carbon tax or a gas tax or a Paris Agreement,” said Thomas J. Pyle, president of the Institute for Energy Research, a think tank that supports fossil fuels. “It lets us all breathe a sigh of relief.” He said that assurance reduced the likelihood that the energy industry would push the administration to leave the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the underlying 1992 treaty that governs climate change negotiations. Climate change activists, on the other hand, voiced worry. “All the brakes are coming off the system in terms of anyone who can try to constrain the president’s worst instincts,” said Alden Meyer, director of strategy and policy at the Union of Concerned Scientists. Mr. Bolton, a Fox News analyst and a former ambassador to the United Nations, has offered mixed views on climate science. Earlier in his career, he questioned the research showing that warming is caused by human activity. More recently, he has accepted that science.  However, his opinion on multilateral agreements like the Paris accord is consistent: They’re bad for America. He has called the Paris Agreement a “self-licking ice cream cone,” an “utterly meaningless document” and part of an attempt by the United Nations to enact a one-world government. Mr. Kudlow, the incoming head of the National Economic Council , also cheered Mr. Trump’s call for a withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, telling a New York radio station, “the U.S. is not going to be a patsy.” Mr. Pompeo called the agreement a “costly burden” to the country. Climate change activists said the best they could hope for was that the Trump administration would ignore the international negotiations, particularly since no major decisions are on the horizon. The United States cannot formally withdraw from the agreement until 2020. “The best case may be that it largely stays beneath the radar,” said Elliot Diringer, executive vice president of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, a nonprofit advocacy group. Between Syria, the Iran nuclear deal and meetings between Mr. Trump and the leaders of Russia and North Korea, he said, “they’ve clearly got pressing matters to contend with.” By  John Schwartz Dear reader: I blew it. A federal judge in San Francisco is preparing to hear a landmark lawsuit that could determine whether fossil fuel companies can be held liable for the costs of climate change, and he ordered that an unusual pretrial hearing he held last week: a tutorial on global warming, with scientific evidence presented to the judge by both sides. But I had already scheduled another reporting trip on that day, so I figured I could watch the live stream of the hearing or catch a replay on video. Technology was not my friend. The judge, William Alsup, is a deeply curious, technically oriented jurist who once discussed his own amateur programming skills in a contentious suit between Oracle and Google. But the court didn’t live-stream last week’s climate hearing. Worse, a representative of the court would later tell me that while the tutorial was taped, it “did not result in any usable footage.” So I’ll have to wait for the transcript to get the whole story. In the meantime, we can all read the great work of reporters and legal scholars who did attend. Jessica Wentz, an attorney and researcher at the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University, tweeted the tutorial live from the courtroom . The Associated Press was there , as were the journal Science , Wired magazine and The Verge . The lawsuit was filed by the cities of San Francisco and Oakland against five fossil fuel companies . The companies, in return, have countersued. This is one of a number of such suits filed by cities ( including New York City ) and counties around the United States. At the hearing, both sides discussed eight questions posed by the judge about the science of a warming planet . But the session was not intended to be dramatic; the companies involved have, by and large, already acknowledged that climate change is real and that humans play a major role. The sole lawyer speaking for the fossil fuel companies, Theodore Boutrous for Chevron, hewed closely to the conclusions of the authoritative 2014 report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , with some effort to raise issues like the remaining degree of uncertainty regarding climate models. Michael Burger, the executive director of the Sabin Center, said the unusual session did not deal with the question of whether individual companies like Chevron can be held liable for the costs of climate change. “It is the key to the case: Why these defendants, why this handful of companies?” he said. Once the trial truly starts, he added, “Ultimately, that will be a battle of the experts.” Brad Plumer is a reporter covering climate change, energy policy and other environmental issues for The Times's climate team.  @ bradplumer  Lisa Friedman reports on climate and environmental policy in Washington.

"We are due a recession in 2020 – and we will lack the tools to fight it","Conditions will soon be ripe for a financial crisis, but governments will have their hands tied  Nouriel Roubini and Brunello Rosa  Thu 13 Sep 2018 15.10 BST   First published on Thu 13 Sep 2018 14.40 BST   A s we mark the 10th anniversary of the collapse of Lehman Brothers, there are still ongoing debates about the causes and consequences of the financial crisis, and whether the lessons needed to prepare for the next one have been absorbed. But looking ahead, the more relevant question is what actually will trigger the next global recession and crisis, and when. The current global expansion will likely continue into next year, given that the US is running large fiscal deficits, China is pursuing loose fiscal and credit policies, and Europe remains on a recovery path. But by 2020, the conditions will be ripe for a financial crisis, followed by a global recession. There are 10 reasons for this. First, the fiscal-stimulus policies that are currently pushing the annual US growth rate above its 2% potential are unsustainable. By 2020, the stimulus will run out, and a modest fiscal drag will pull growth from 3% to slightly below 2%. Second, because the stimulus was poorly timed, the US economy is now overheating, and inflation is rising above target. The US Federal Reserve will thus continue to raise the federal funds rate from its current 2% to at least 3.5% by 2020, and that will likely push up short- and long-term interest rates as well as the US dollar. Meanwhile, inflation is also increasing in other key economies, and rising oil prices are contributing additional inflationary pressures. That means the other major central banks will follow the Fed toward monetary-policy normalisation, which will reduce global liquidity and put upward pressure on interest rates. Third, the Trump administration’s trade disputes with China, Europe, Mexico, Canada and others will almost certainly escalate, leading to slower growth and higher inflation. Fourth, other US policies will continue to add stagflationary pressure, prompting the Fed to raise interest rates higher still. The administration is restricting inward/outward investment and technology transfers, which will disrupt supply chains. It is restricting the immigrants who are needed to maintain growth as the US population ages. It is discouraging investments in the green economy. And it has no infrastructure policy to address supply-side bottlenecks. Fifth, growth in the rest of the world will likely slow down – more so as other countries will see fit to retaliate against US protectionism. China must slow its growth to deal with overcapacity and excessive leverage; otherwise a hard landing will be triggered. And already-fragile emerging markets will continue to feel the pinch from protectionism and tightening monetary conditions in the US. Sixth, Europe, too, will experience slower growth, owing to monetary-policy tightening and trade frictions. Moreover, populist policies in countries such as Italy may lead to an unsustainable debt dynamic within the eurozone. The still-unresolved “doom loop” between governments and banks holding public debt will amplify the existential problems of an incomplete monetary union with inadequate risk-sharing. Under these conditions, another global downturn could prompt Italy and other countries to exit the eurozone altogether . Seventh, US and global equity markets are frothy. Price-to-earnings ratios in the US are 50% above the historic average, private-equity valuations have become excessive, and government bonds are too expensive, given their low yields and negative term premia. And high-yield credit is also becoming increasingly expensive now that the US corporate-leverage rate has reached historic highs. Moreover, the leverage in many emerging markets and some advanced economies is clearly excessive. Commercial and residential real estate is far too expensive in many parts of the world. The emerging-market correction in equities, commodities, and fixed-income holdings will continue as global storm clouds gather. And as forward-looking investors start anticipating a growth slowdown in 2020, markets will reprice risky assets by 2019. Eighth, once a correction occurs, the risk of illiquidity and fire sales/undershooting will become more severe. There are reduced market-making and warehousing activities by broker-dealers. Excessive high-frequency/algorithmic trading will raise the likelihood of “flash crashes.” And fixed-income instruments have become more concentrated in open-ended exchange-traded and dedicated credit funds. In the case of a risk-off, emerging markets and advanced-economy financial sectors with massive dollar-denominated liabilities will no longer have access to the Fed as a lender of last resort. With inflation rising and policy normalisation underway, the backstop that central banks provided during the post-crisis years can no longer be counted on. Ninth, Trump was already attacking the Fed when the growth rate was recently 4%. Just think about how he will behave in the 2020 election year, when growth likely will have fallen below 1% and job losses emerge. The temptation for Trump to “ wag the dog ” by manufacturing a foreign-policy crisis will be high, especially if the Democrats retake the House of Representatives this year. Since Trump has already started a trade war with China and wouldn’t dare attack nuclear-armed North Korea, his last best target would be Iran. By provoking a military confrontation with that country, he would trigger a stagflationary geopolitical shock not unlike the oil-price spikes of 1973, 1979 and 1990. Needless to say, that would make the oncoming global recession even more severe. Finally, once the perfect storm outlined above occurs, the policy tools for addressing it will be sorely lacking. The space for fiscal stimulus is already limited by massive public debt. The possibility for more unconventional monetary policies will be limited by bloated balance sheets and the lack of headroom to cut policy rates. And financial-sector bailouts will be intolerable in countries with resurgent populist movements and near-insolvent governments. In the US specifically, lawmakers have constrained the ability of the Fed to provide liquidity to non-bank and foreign financial institutions with dollar-denominated liabilities. And in Europe, the rise of populist parties is making it harder to pursue EU-level reforms and create the institutions necessary to combat the next financial crisis and downturn. Unlike in 2008, when governments had the policy tools needed to prevent a free fall, the policymakers who must confront the next downturn will have their hands tied while overall debt levels are higher than during the previous crisis. When it comes, the next crisis and recession could be even more severe and prolonged than the last."
"Why finding a flat in Tehran is as hard as in London and NYC","Western style real estate agencies are springing up to lend a hand and take a cut Tehran Bureau correspondent  Mon 27 Apr 2015 05.00 BST   Last modified on Mon 27 Apr 2015 12.31 BST   The lease on my old 55-square-meter apartment in Tehran is up, and that means another long, arduous search for a new place. My landlord’s excuse for driving me out this time was that his daughter, who is coming back to Tehran from Canada in May, needs a place of her own. As the Persian New Year begins, I begin my search for a better place than the one I’ve just been kicked out of: a ground floor unit in a 40-year-old, three story, 11-unit building on Daman Afshardar Street near Vanak Square. In Iran , like many other big cities, people generally rent apartments by paying both a monthly rent as well as a security deposit. Some landlords prefer to get most if not all of the money up front. In Tehran, for every 30,000 tomans of monthly rent, a 1 million toman - or 10 million rials - security deposit is generally required [$300 US]. Renting without a security deposit is virtually unheard of. The monthly rent on my quiet apartment on Daman Afshardar Street was 1.95 million tomans, for which I had paid a 15 million security deposit. I’m now willing to pay up to 2.4 million a month for a bigger place (70 square meters at least). I have also managed to save up an additional 15 million tomans over a one-year period to double the size of the security deposit I can afford to put down for something in an acceptable neighborhood. Neighborhood is key. In Tehran there is a widely held belief that substantive differences exist between those who live in the north and south. Many see this issue as a historical one. When Iran was modernizing in the early to mid-20th century under Reza Shah Pahlavi, the aristocracy and the moneyed classes largely moved to the northern parts of town, whereas the poor and working classes (and many traditional ones) stayed put in south Tehran. Valiasr Street , the longest north-south street in Tehran, serves as the most frequent point of reference when asking where in Tehran a new acquaintance lives. A lot hangs on the answer, too, and it can even have implications among friends and loved ones. Tehranis derive a sense of respectability from being able to provide the right answer to this question, to strangers at parties, whose smiles grow wider and wider depending on how far north an address is located. Even at work, the question is not uncommon, and people use it as a standard to judge others and rely on it as an indicator of how they can expect to be treated. My adventure to secure a new home began just two days after Iranian and western negotiators hammered out a framework agreement over Iran’s nuclear program. Unfortunately, however, the news that brought Tehranis out into the streets in celebration didn’t have the intended effect on the housing market, and rents in Tehran shot up. While I’ve never had a great deal of patience for socialists rambling on about living in a classless society, I’ve also never entertained fantasies about living on Elahieh Street, Zafaranieh, Aghdasieh, Farmanieh, or any of the other more glamorous spots in north Tehran. For me, a car, occasional trips, decent clothes, and cologne are much higher priorities than a trendy location. But the problem is that Tehran has a way of convincing you that location really is everything, and it leads many to allocate ever-larger portions of their monthly income to rent. Even though we don’t even live together, my girlfriend has also played a role in my present predicament. She occasionally complained about my place, saying that if it were up to her, she would never have guests over. So in hopes of securing a bigger, newer place - maybe one near Vanak Square - I’m prepared to pay around 90,000 extra tomans per month. I’m looking to score a place on Molla Sadra, Gandhi , Vozara, Mirza-ye Shirazi, Karim Khan, Argentine , or somewhere near the beginning of Africa Street. Altogether there are three major pros to living on these streets: first, you have easy access to other areas of Tehran, the main squares, and the rapid bus and metro stops. Second, even though they don’t have quite the prestige of streets like Mirdamad and Jordan, they’re still respectable areas that are mostly home to educated, middle-class people. Third, rents there are much lower than in some adjacent, more luxurious areas. The most important source for information about available homes in Tehran is the classifieds section of Hamshahri, a newspaper owned by the Tehran city government and the newspaper with the highest circulation in the country. Apartment listings in Hamshahri are by size: there are categories for 50 square meters, 50-70 square meters, over 70 square meters, over 90 square meters, and over 100 square meters. I found only a few suitable apartments in the 50-70 category, and most of the listings advertised places far to the west, like Jannat Abad, or very far south, like Pirouzi. The only two or three in the areas I wanted asked for too much up front, plus a monthly rent, so they were out of the question. Many of the ads don’t even publish the prices in hopes that more people will call in to inquire. Contrary to what I’d expected, most of the numbers I called didn’t connect me to building owners, but to real estate rental agencies. Building owners hand over the job of renting out their apartments to these places, which publish the ads with the rents in Hamshahri in hopes of renting them out faster. Calling these agents on the phone can be a stressful and ultimately fruitless affair: at any moment, they can put a caller on hold and start chatting with someone else, only to forget the first caller altogether. And even if you’re lucky enough to get through an entire conversation without being cut off, you still won’t walk away with a great deal of information. For example, when you ask about the specifics of an apartment, an agent might respond, “Well, I can’t discuss that over the phone; you’ll need to come down and see the place for yourself. Here, write down our business address...” They also seem too hurried to answer many basic questions that people might have about an apartment, such as the age of the building, the unit floor, elevator, parking, and storage space. Tehran’s 3.5 million vehicles are engaged in an unending search for a place to park. Even though people now park on Tehran’s narrowest streets, and many other streets have been turned into free or paid parking zones by the municipality, finding parking near one’s home is still a constant struggle. My old place didn’t have parking, so I paid 100,000 tomans a month to the guard at the municipal parking lot to let me park across the street. For my new apartment, I’ll need a place with secure parking, as I’m not looking to add a stolen car to my list of potential troubles. After a while, it starts to seem like calling the agencies is a waste of time and that simply showing up at their offices might be the best option. There are also numerous apartment hunting websites that promise more information on available apartments, such as “Iran File,” “The Wall,” and “Home Bazaar,” but even the phone numbers there often lead right back to one of the agencies. Iran has two major types of real estate agencies: old-school and modern. The agencies operating the old fashioned way are generally 20-30 square meter operations run by people over 50 and featuring only one or two desks, and a handful of chairs arranged around the office. When you ask about the size and price of a home, they refer to thick tomes containing the desired information. The modern offices are typically much bigger - 100 square meters of open space - and they inevitably have an attractive young lady greeting guests at the front door. After asking whether the potential client is looking to rent, buy, or sell, she directs them to a commensurately young, attractive and well-dressed man. There are generally around ten desks in such offices and as many real estate brokers. They adhere to the practice of introducing themselves by their first names and have clients fill out and sign a lengthy intake form. The form even has a place for “level of education” and “occupation,” and it asks customers’ preferences in terms of location and a variety of other factors, although desired rent and area are notably absent. The first home I saw was just a little bit above Valiasr Square on Karim Khan Street. Even though I had specified that living in peace and quiet was of the utmost importance, the apartment is in an area just off one of the most congested and noisy parts of the city. “Relax, buddy!” the agent reassured me when I asked why he bothered bringing me to such a noisy area. “First of all, you’re at the back of the building where there is less noise. Second, you’ve got double paned windows up there. And third...well, you’ll just get used to it!” Karim Khan Street is one of Tehran’s commercial hubs, and the traffic there is so frenetic and unceasing that the area always finds itself the target of municipal traffic plans, meaning that only buses, taxis, and cars holding special traffic plan tickets can travel through the area. The street is also bursting at the seams with shops: the center of Iran’s gold exchange market calls it home, as do a number of large booksellers and confectioneries. One of the largest national pharmacies in the country, 13th of Aban, is also there. Many of Karim Khan Street’s residents are middle class, educated, and frequently employed in offices or as teachers. Upon opening the front door, we walked into an old, dirty hallway and took a minute-long elevator ride to the fifth floor. The house was 70 square meters and, at first glance, didn’t inspire much confidence: the ceiling had numerous cracks, there was obviously no room for a washer and dryer, and the noise from the street filled the room, contrary to what the agent had just said downstairs. What’s more, the price was higher than similar places on Karim Khan: 2 million tomans monthly rent plus 30 million tomans up front. After seeing a few more places on Karim Khan and in nearby South Mofateh to no avail, I figured that the average rent in these areas had risen sharply since last year. One apartment on the relatively well-to-do Mirdamad Street was so nice that I was all ready to sign the contract. Mirdamad has many of Iran’s biggest commercial buildings, meaning rents are pretty high. For example, a relatively new but otherwise average 65 square meter apartment on South Razan was going for 3 million tomans per month and 45 million tomans up front. Still, I was able to find a quiet apartment on small Nesa Street just off Mirdamad, and the price wasn’t half bad either: 2.5 million toman per month and 30 million up front. The six-story, thirty-unit building had a mostly granite front, a big parking garage, and two elevators. The interior of the apartment was equally pleasing. It had parquet floors and bright wallpaper that brought the whole place together, a chic, open kitchen, MDF cabinets, and an advanced ventilation system. It had one 20 square meter bedroom with an ideally situated window and a 35 square meter living room with sofas and a dining table with enough room for six people. The apartment’s main drawback was the 2.5 by 1 meter bathroom, which had a toilet and a shower smashed up next to each other. The agent told me he would try to get a good discount from the owner, a middle-aged woman, and negotiate the contract to 2.2 million tomans per month and 30 million up front. He called the owner to arrange a meeting between us at the real estate agency and we planned to meet at 8pm in Vanak Square. This was the fourth straight day that I had been out apartment hunting from 8 in the morning to 9 at night. I’d fallen behind in my work and my editors were giving me a hard time about deadlines, but I was nonetheless overjoyed to have found a place not only at a decent price, but in an area I knew I would really appreciate. Just a few hours later my euphoria was shattered by a call from the real estate agent, who said that the owner wasn’t answering her phone to confirm the 8pm appointment in Vanak. He told me to wait for his call. After 24 hours, the agent finally got a hold of the owner, who said she was extremely sorry but she’d given the place to someone else. The news hit me like a sledgehammer. I shuddered at the thought that all of that schlepping around Tehran, suffering through the heat and breathing in all the exhaust, had been for naught. But there was nothing else to do; I had to go down the treacherous road once again. I ended up seeing between 10 and 15 more places in Molla Sadra, Yousef Abad, Vozara, Argentine, and Sanaei. Either the rents were astronomical or they were tolerable but the places were totally unsuitable. Even when there were decent apartments with decent rents, I ran up against my one fatal problem: I’m a bachelor. Landlords and single people in Iran have a historical enmity towards each other, and the former typically prefer to rent homes out to families or young couples. Their main reasoning is that single men and women are only going to throw wild parties and “do nasty things” there. To my chagrin and outrage, many landowners wouldn’t even agree to show me the place in question upon learning that I was unmarried. Despite all of the love I have for my Iranian culture, it’s sometimes difficult to suppress the hate and frustration that bubbles up when I’m reminded that being single is depriving me of finding a place to live. The real estate agents assume almost no responsibility either; after all, their main job is pulling the wool over people’s eyes. You can now count me among the many Tehranis who have a negative view of these real estate agents. Some of the listings they sent made me wonder if they’d even bothered to look at my intake form. The supervisor at an agency on Shariati Street set up an appointment for me to check out a building on Farid Afshar in a pretty fancy area called Zafar. The rent was 2 million tomans per month with 10 million up front, and the apartment was 90 square meters. I arrived to see the place at 11am. It was old, had no private parking, and was on a dead end with very little room for parking on the street. An attractive, well-dressed woman of about 50 opened the door for me. I could tell by the endless ceremonial hellos she was giving me that my bachelorhood would pose no problem for her. Contrary to what I’d been expecting, the apartment was actually underground. I hate living in a basement apartment, and as we trudged down through what felt like a dusty, musty garage, I remembered exactly why that is. Meanwhile, the woman did her best to try to rent the place out to me. “I have only one condition for you if you rent the place: You have to have at least two parties a week,” she said at one point with a hearty laugh. “Otherwise, what good are you?” I forced my own laugh, but my gut told me that she was preparing me for a real eyesore of an apartment. Even listening to my gut wasn’t enough warning. When she opened the door, my heart sank. It had a big living room, but with the oldest and dirtiest walls I had probably seen since the Iran-Iraq war. The floors were an oily, muddy stone, and the cabinets in the kitchen were literally falling apart. Even at 11am, so little light made it into the apartment that the place looked like a dank cave. The adjacent bedroom was even filthier than the living room and so dark that I had to use the light from my mobile phone just to look around a little bit, and the toilet was full of broken tile. The scene reminded me of stuff I’d imagined while reading Oliver Twist at a young age. As I reeled from taking the place in, I heard the woman’s muffled voice from the other room. “You can hang your whiskey glasses up here if you want,” she said. “Rent here and I’ll give you a great discount because you’re such a nice young man.” After hurriedly bidding her farewell, I called the agent who had referred me there and took out all of my anger and frustration from the past several days. “I told you I wanted a place with light and you sent me to a mausoleum!” I yelled. The agent was about to start explaining when I hung up the phone. I was disappointed and hopeless and had nearly lost all my patience. I decided that I would have to rent a slightly more expensive home if I was going to be happy. I was willing to pay 3 million tomans a month for one of the decent apartments I’d seen earlier. Sure, that amounted to about 80% of my monthly income, but my common sense had basically run out too. As I walked farther and farther away from the apartment that had so sharply resembled the Dickensian soup kitchens, I turned toward Molla Sadra, near Vanak Square, a relatively calm area near the Kurdestan Freeway that has mostly new apartments. There a miracle occurred in the form of a 75 square meter apartment that fell right into my lap. It had white ceramic floors, beautiful wallpaper, a western toilet, a large living room and bedroom, plenty of light, parking, and storage. The final stage in the process is signing the contract back at the rental agency, and the final moments leading up to it provide the best opportunity to get a last minute discount from the landlord. The landlord in my case was a retired high school teacher who bought the remodeled apartment in 1997 with a government loan. “I’ve got a duty to help you out,” she said upon hearing that I was a journalist. “I’ll be really flexible with you. Here, I’ll even knock a million rials off your rent.” Even when I ask for a bigger discount a moment later, she obliges me. When all is said and done, the year-long lease comes out to 30 million tomans up front and 2.2 million a month. I was even able to score a major victory in the form of a roughly 200,000 tomans a month discount. In order to finalize the contract, I have to sign and date twelve checks, one for each month of the year, up front. The rental agent also gets the equivalent of the first month’s rent from both parties; in addition to that commission, I also have to deposit 1.1 million tomans into the account of the agency’s owner. As I was thinking to myself what a sweet gig those real estate agents had - all that pay for so little work, after all - I overheard two of them speaking near the exit about a colleague’s income. “You can bag twenty billion rials a month from that complex,” one of them said. “Even someone building high rises doesn’t make that much money.”"
"Five Blunt Truths About the North Korea Crisis","1. The Trump strategy on North Korea is failing. President Trump said in January that a North Korean test of an intercontinental ballistic missile âwonât happenâ Â â but it just did. This is a big deal, because North Korea increasingly will be able to target the United States with nuclear, chemical and biological weapons (we donât know if North Korea can currently attach a nuclear warhead to a missile, but it will be able to soon if it canât now). Maybe missile defense systems could stop them, maybe not. Most experts think itâs unlikely that North Korea would take out Los Angeles just for the thrill of it. But âunlikelyâ isnât all that reassuring when youâre living in the crosshairs. And in the event of the collapse of North Korea, some angry general may decide that if the regime is going down, the United States should pay a price as well. My colleague David Sanger has a good analysis of the risks . 2. The Obama and Bush strategy on North Korea didnât work either. The U.S. has over the years pursued hawkish and dovish policies, and neither has really succeeded. Thatâs because North Korea is determined to develop a nuclear capacity for regime survival. It notes that Libya and Iraq were toppled in part because they didnât have a nuclear deterrent, and for that reason itâs very hard to see Kim Jong-un giving up his nuclear program. The U.S. aim of denuclearizing the Korean peninsula simply doesnât seem very credible any more. You can make a case, however, that the Clinton strategy toward North Korea kind of worked. In 1994, Clinton worked out an âAgreed Frameworkâ to stop North Koreaâs nuclear program. It was an ugly agreement, with the United States essentially bribing North Korea with oil and a new nuclear reactor to give up its program, and neither side fully lived up to it (North Korea cheated on the side by pursuing uranium weapon technology). But the bottom line is that during eight years of Clintonâs presidency, North Korea didnât add a single nuclear warhead to its stockpile. The agreement was messy, but it was a much better outcome than what unfolded in the first Bush administration (when North Korea first developed nuclear weapons) or the second Bush or Obama administrations. 3. Chinese pressure isnât a silver bullet. China perhaps can be persuaded to put a bit more pressure on North Korea, and it would be helpful in particular if the flow of high-technology from China to North Korea were stopped (North Korean missiles are built partly with imports from China). But China isnât going to cut North Korea off, because it doesnât want North Korea to collapse; it fears having a U.S. military ally on its own China/Korea border. Even if Iâm wrong and China were willing to apply enormous pressure, itâs hard to see North Korea buckling and giving up its nuclear program. Nukes are Kim Jong-unâs priority. In the 1990s, North Korea presided over a famine in which more than half a million Koreans died, and the regime didnât budge. If further sanctions cause another famine and more North Koreans to die, thatâs not going to trouble Kim Jong-un enough for him to give up his nuclear stockpile. 4. The Westâs military options are awful. Â One of the great risks in the coming years is that President Trump stumbles into a war in the Korean peninsula. It may be tempting for the United States to strike a North Korean missile site, and this might even succeed. But it might also lead North Korea to strike back at South Korea and Japan and begin a new Korean war. The basic problem is that North Korea has 21,000 artillery pieces, many of them aimed at Seoul, a metro area of 25 million people. Hundreds more missiles could reach Tokyo, and North Korea is close to a hair trigger because of fears that the United States would try to take out its artillery pieces and missiles. The devastation to Seoul and Tokyo, and to the world economy, in any conflict would be enormous. In the end, North Korea would be quickly destroyed, but at a devastating cost. Gary Luck, the former commander of U.S. forces in South Korea, used to say that the result would be 1 million casualties and $1 trillion in damages. I explored this in an April column about the “ Trump/North Korea Nightmare .â And Motoko Rich has a detailed assessment today of how a limited strike can easily escalate into full-scale war. 5. The least awful option is diplomacy. It should beÂ aimed at a deal in which North Korea freezes its nuclear and missile programs in exchange for some sanctions relief and a downscaling of military exercises in the area. Itâs not clear that this would work, but China has backed the general idea and some North Koreans have seemed open to the idea. My colleagues on the editorial board have a good editorial making this point. The caveat is that the negotiations would drag on, North Korea might well cheat, and it doesnât solve the problem but delays it indefinitely. Still, the alternatives seem to be worse: either North Korea gaining the capacity to target the U.S. or a risk of another Korean war. The basic challenge of international relations is that there are more problems than solutions, and we should give diplomacy a chance.

"May pleads with EU27 for Brexit deal she can defend","Prime minister attempts to charm at dinner with admission talks got off to a bad start – but offers no fresh financial concessions  Rowena Mason and  Jennifer Rankin in Brussels, and  Anushka Asthana  Fri 20 Oct 2017 07.25 BST   First published on Thu 19 Oct 2017 22.30 BST   Theresa May pleaded with EU leaders over dinner in Brussels to help her strike a Brexit deal that she can defend to voters back home, admitting talks had got off to a bad start over the summer. The prime minister made the appeal over dinner with 27 other EU leaders but did not offer any fresh financial concessions to help break the deadlock in talks, which have been stuck on the issue of Britain’s divorce bill for months . Speaking on Thursday night, the prime minister said both sides needed an “outcome that we can stand behind and defend to our people”, hinting at the political difficulty she would have in selling a deal that involves handing over a large sum to the EU . May’s promise to honour the UK’s financial commitments amounts to about €20bn (£18bn) but she has not come up with a specific figure and EU negotiators believe Britain’s liabilities are at least €60bn. Arriving at the summit in Brussels, EU leaders stood firm on the idea that trade talks could only begin once the UK offered more detail on the Brexit bill but some continental leaders appeared to offer hope that the impasse over money could be broken in the coming weeks. Angela Merkel , the German chancellor, put her stamp on the established EU position when she said Brexit negotiations could move on to trade by December. “From where we are now, [progress] is not sufficient enough to enter the second phase, but it is encouraging to move on with the work so that we can reach the second phase in December,” she said. The upbeat tone was echoed by Luxembourg’s prime minister, Xavier Bettel, who said: “We were friends, we are friends and we still will be friends; I am sure we will find an agreement.” He noted the change in tone between May’s speeches, including her latest overture to EU citizens living in the UK . “Times change and even Theresa May’s Facebook post went in the right direction.” But there was a less positive analysis from the Lithuanian president, Dalia Grybauskaitė, who said May had “not yet” come up with a good proposal. In typically caustic remarks, she said: “Theresa May needs to persuade herself and her government to be more forthcoming and realistic.” The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, said he had asked May last week to offer more detail on the Brexit bill. “Theresa May has to come up with more clarity on what she meant with other commitments in her Florence speech. I phoned her last week and tried to encourage her to do that and so far she hasn’t,” he said. In her address over dinner, May avoided putting a number on how much the UK was willing to pay to Brussels, stressing that she had already promised to honour the UK’s financial obligations, including paying into the EU budget until 2021. She claimed to have made the first concessions and called on the EU to do the same, saying she made her Florence speech after she “recognised the difficulty the process was in”. “I took stock, listened to what people in UK were saying and what my friends and partners in Europe were saying and I made a step forwards,” she said. Arguing the EU leaders must make the next move when they meet without her on Friday, she said their “clear and urgent imperative must be that the dynamic you create enables us to move forward again”. The aim should be moving on to talk about a future relationship between the EU and Britain that “sets rights and obligations in a new and different balance”. Although May made no fresh offers, the tone of her address to EU leaders was intended to be conciliatory. She made no mention of the threat of leaving with no deal, which both sides acknowledged was a growing possibility after the fifth round of talks made little progress. The prime minister spoke for about five minutes during coffee at the end of a meal that had been focused on EU foreign policy challenges, including Iran, North Korea and Turkey. “As expected, nobody reacted,” an EU source told the Guardian. Speaking to journalists after the dinner, Merkel rejected suggestions the EU negotiating mandate was too strict. “I don’t think so,” she said giving an upbeat assessment of the prospects for a breakthrough. “Both sides have to move. We are going to achieve a good result, there will be a good outcome.” But she made clear the next stage of Brexit talks would be tougher than the current one, which is focused on divorce issues, including money. Merkel said the second, trade-focused round was “undeniably going to be more complicated than the first stage”. The EU would also find it “more difficult” to formulate a mandate to guide those talks she said. Rightwing Conservative Eurosceptics, including former cabinet ministers Owen Paterson and John Redwood, are suggesting May should walk away from talks rather than offer more cash, but the prime minister’s spokesman said the focus was on getting on with the talks. Damian Green, her deputy and first secretary of state, played down calls for a “no deal” Brexit on Thursday: “I think it’s hugely desirable that we get a deal. I think it will be good for Britain. I think it will be good for the other EU countries as well. And because of that fact, I think it is likely that we will get a deal.” However, Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, issued a much starker warning that the Tories talking up the idea of “no deal” were threatening the economic security of the UK. “I’m bemused by this argument that if you threaten to jump over a cliff that is a good negotiating tactic,” he said. “Going over the cliff is what will happen in March 2019 if we have not reached an agreement: we are going over that cliff... “That would be very serious situation, as well. You’ve only got to run through tariffs whether in agricultural, meat products, textiles or cars. I think there would be a crisis of confidence in the economy.” Despite their focus on getting an agreement, the government is stepping up preparations for the possibility of not achieving one, as it emerged that the Brexit secretary, David Davis, will present cabinet with an assessment of the potential benefits of such a scenario in the coming weeks. The EU leaders will gather for discussions on Brexit without May on Friday morning, where they are expected to say they will start making preparations for trade talks among themselves in readiness for the possibility of negotiations from December. So far, the UK’s desire to start negotiating a trade deal has been stymied by the EU’s strict negotiating timetable, which demands “sufficient progress” in settling Britain’s EU divorce first. Shortly before the summit began, footage showed the British prime minister in earnest conversation with Merkel and the French president, Emmanuel Macron . As he arrived at the summit, he said the EU’s unity was “very strong on Brexit … we are all united behind one negotiator, Michel Barnier”. The German chancellor also revealed that she had been talking about the Iran nuclear deal with Macron and May, as the three arrived in the summit room deep in conversation.  For the EU, Brexit is a sideshow at the summit, which has a heavy agenda of foreign policy issues. May acknowledged this as she arrived at the summit, saying: “This council isn’t just about our exit negotiations, it’s also about various other really important issues: defence, security, counter-terrorism, migration, and I am going to be showing how the UK can continue playing a full role.” The prime minister has repeatedly attempted to go over the heads of the EU’s Brexit negotiators by appealing to European leaders to jump start the talks. This week, No 10 tacitly admitted this gambit had failed when it signed up to a joint Brussels statement that “both sides agreed that [Brexit] would be discussed in the framework agreed between the EU27 and the United Kingdom”."
"Iran's advances create alarm in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf","Arabs believe Baghdad, Damascus, Beirut and Sana’a are in effect under Iranian control – and power may shift further if US sanctions are eased  Ian Black Middle East editor  Fri 13 Mar 2015 16.03 GMT   Last modified on Sat 14 Apr 2018 19.03 BST   The commanders of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) have been working overtime recently, flaunting their achievements across the Middle East and flexing muscles as international negotiations over the country’s nuclear programme enter their critical and perhaps final phase. On Wednesday it was the turn of Major-General Mohammad Ali Jafari, the IRGC’s most senior officer. “The Islamic revolution is advancing with good speed, its example being the ever-increasing export of the revolution,” he declared. “Not only Palestine and Lebanon acknowledge the influential role of the Islamic Republic but so do the people of Iraq and Syria. They appreciate the nation of Iran.” Last month a similarly boastful message was delivered by General Qassem Suleimani, who leads the IRGC’s elite Quds force — and who is regularly photographed leading the fightback of Iraqi Shia miltias against the Sunni jihadis of the Islamic State (Isis) as well as against western and Arab-backed rebels fighting Bashar al-Assad in southern Syria . “Imperialists and Zionists have admitted defeat at the hands of the Islamic Republic and the resistance movement,” Suleimani said. Iran’s advances are fuelling alarm in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf, where Tehran has been a strategic rival since the days of the Shah, and which now, it is said with dismay, in effect controls four Arab capitals – Baghdad, Damascus and Beirut and in the last month Sana’a in Yemen – which is uncomfortably close to home. Iran’s regional position has certainly improved. Its high-profile role fighting Isis in Iraq, Assad’s retention of control in Syria with the help of its Lebanese ally Hezbollah, and the Houthi rebel takeover in Yemen have all been deeply discomfiting for the Saudis. Anti-government protests in Shia-majority Bahrain are also often blamed on Tehran — though that ignores the domestic roots of the unrest. In Riyadh King Salman has dropped his preoccupation with the Muslim Brotherhood in favour of building a united Sunni Arab front to confront the Iranians, diplomats say, though translating that strategy into action is another matter. The message from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates is that whatever the outcome of the nuclear talks, Iran is bent on expanding its power and influence. “The Iranians have scored major victories but only where there are Shia minorities,” a senior Gulf official told the Guardian. “Our concern is that the nuclear issue will become a tool of their foreign policy.” Arab alarm is shared by Israel. Binyamin Netanyahu used identical arguments in his recent speech to the US Congress, timed to influence next week’s nuclear endgame in Geneva. “The Saudis will be incredibly worried that we are getting close to a point where the Iranians will be players because of the nuclear issue and the way the Americans have effectively ended up on the same side as the Iranians in Iraq ,” said one veteran Saudi-watcher. “But the noise they are making is in inverse proportion to their ability to do anything about it.” Arab governments are not reassured by the promises of John Kerry, the US secretary of state, that Washington is not seeking a “grand bargain” with Tehran that will allow it to “destabilise” the Middle East, bolstered by the easing of economic sanctions . Saud Al Faisal, the Saudi foreign minister, warned of Tehran’s “hegemonic” ambitions as the IRGC supported the military operation to retake the Iraqi town of Tikrit from Isis. In Gulf capitals Hassan Rouhani, the emollient Iranian president, is seen as less important than the hardline supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. It is hard to disentangle propaganda from reality. But independent analysts argue that Iran is inflating its gains for both foreign and domestic consumption. “If you listen to Suleimani there is a degree of exaggeration,” argues Ali Ansari of St Andrews University. “It’s rhetorical reassurance. He is saying to Iranians: ‘We are powerful and and everyone is worried about this’ – partly to make the point that they are not really under pressure. People outside can see what Iran’s strengths and weaknesses are. But there is this belief that you need to negotiate from a position of strength and that if you are weak you will be trampled on.” Iran-watcher Hossein Rassam also detects a domestic calculation in the IRGC statements. “Critics of Rouhani’s policy of rapprochement with the international community inside Iran can turn to the supreme leader and say there wasn’t really much need for that softer tone because now we have more bargaining chips in our hands. Iran is the only power in the region which can actually fight Isis and the west needs us for that.” Meir Litvak, an Israeli expert on Iran, sees both genuine belief and posturing in Tehran’s stance. “The Iranians believe they have been able to save the Assad regime from total collapse and there is at least stalemate in Syria,” he said. “That means they have been able to maintain the link with Hezbollah and maybe open a second front by proxy against Israel on the Golan Heights. The Houthi rebellion in Yemen was initially a genuinely domestic affair but the Iranian regime saw it as an opportunity. And it has become a bonus for it – even if they are not that active in Yemen . But if the Saudis are scared that’s a plus for the Iranians.” Arab diplomatic sources say they expect to see an IRGC and Hezbollah presence in Yemen, helped by a new agreement on regular flights between Tehran and Sana’a. Iran’s role in Bahrain, where the Shia majority remains locked in confrontation with the Saudi-backed Sunni monarchy, is more about scoring propaganda points than material support – despite claims in Manama about Iran’s sinister role. Still, in the heartlands of Iranian influence, Iraq and Syria, there have been significant costs as well as benefits, including the deaths of two senior IRGC commanders. Continuing sanctions and low oil prices – seen in Tehran as a deliberate strategy by the Saudis – have also made it harder to shell out billions of dollars to subsidise the Assad regime. Iran’s great advantage, suggests Emile Hokayem, an analyst, is its commitment and competence, in Syria and beyond. “The expertise, experience and strategic patience it deployed in support of the Syrian regime to a great extent facilitated Assad’s recovery from serious setbacks in 2012. In contrast, the war in Syria has exposed not only the political and operational limitations of the Gulf states, but also the rivalries among them.”"
"Retiring a U.N. Building Not Quite Fit for the World Stage","Advertisement Supported by By  David W. Dunlap UNITED NATIONS — In New York, “temporary” train stations , “temporary” art installations and “temporary” sidewalk sheds can endure for a decade or more. So it is a marvel to report that an interim building will turn out to be just that. Perhaps because it is technically not in New York. The six-year-old, $140 million North Lawn Building, an almost windowless mass of concrete and white corrugated steel that stretches from 46th to 47th Street along the East River, was designed to house the critical operations of the United Nations while the headquarters complex was being renovated. Now that the $2.15 billion renovation is finished , the North Lawn Building is, too. It is to be demolished over the next five months, though “dismantled” might be a better word, since the contractor has an incentive to recycle. The United Nations set an upper limit of $16.76 million for the demolition contract, which was competitively bid. That encouraged prospective contractors to extract as much value as possible from the reuse of building materials. This approach attracted contractors who could not only recycle air-conditioning units and steel panels but who also had the “sophistication to grind up concrete and sell it to highway departments,” said Michael Adlerstein, the assistant secretary general who oversaw the renovation. The winning bidder was Gramercy Group . Another marvel to report: The building will be replaced by open space. The North Lawn — the lungs of the headquarters complex — is to be recreated. Part of the Berlin Wall given in 2002 by Germany will return to the lawn from the sidelines, as will artworks like Antun Augustincic ’s equestrian “ Peace ” sculpture, given by Yugoslavia in 1954. Planting will begin in spring. Final landscaping should be completed in time for the 2016 General Debate, said Werner Schmidt, a public information officer. The General Debate is the autumnal meeting of world leaders, at the beginning of the General Assembly, that generally slows the Turtle Bay section of Manhattan to a crawl. It is held in the domed General Assembly Hall, which opened in 1952. The hall ennobles even the most contentious speakers with its majestic rostrum. A green marble lectern bearing the United Nations emblem sits before a green marble dais. Above hovers a lustrous, curving 75-foot wall of gold leaf with a colossal version of the United Nations emblem — a polar azimuthal equidistant projection of the globe embraced by olive branches — in shimmering aluminum leaf. In 2013, the General Debate was moved to the North Lawn Building, about 150 feet away, which was designed by the architecture firm HLW . The temporary assembly hall had a lectern and dais made of faux-marble composite board. The wall was painted gold and stood only 18 feet high. President Obama stood at the composite-board lectern on the morning of Sept. 24, 2013 , to tell the community of nations that the United States would be engaged in the Middle East “ for the long haul .” President Hassan Rouhani of Iran followed him in the afternoon, saying that the United States and Iran could “ arrive at a framework to manage our differences” on a nuclear agreement. The leaders avoided meeting each other , however. A few days later, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said Iran’s nuclear weapons capacity must be fully dismantled. In the tight shots favored by most photographers and camera operators, the stage-set rostrum passed muster, Mr. Adlerstein, the assistant secretary general, said. Besides, he said, “the business of the United Nations is so intense in rooms like the General Assembly or Security Council that all you need is to give a sense of the place.” That may be, but Secretary General Ban Ki-moon  told delegates in 2013: “I will make sure that by next year this time, leaders will be able to take the floor in the newly renovated General Assembly Hall. I hope you will convey this message.” In the measured language of diplomacy, the message was really directed to Mr. Adlerstein as much as anyone. It amounted to an order. He took it as such. Though the capital master plan office was otherwise given a good deal of autonomy in the renovation, it hurried to finish the sumptuous restoration of the real assembly hall in time for the 2014 General Debate. Since then, the temporary hall has seen several uses, most recently as a workroom for Umoja , a project under which the United Nations is consolidating many different computerized management systems. The global emblems from the temporary rostrum were salvaged for future use, Mr. Schmidt said. All else was turned over to the demolition contractor. But the North Lawn Building has at least a tiny place in history. To celebrate the rejuvenation of the headquarters complex, Rizzoli published “ The United Nations at 70: Restoration and Renewal .” Mr. Schmidt took the cover photograph.

These examples start with the more reform-minded and move across the political spectrum to the most conservative. Reformist politician Aref was first vice president under President Mohammad Khatami (1997 to 2005). He is currently a member of the expediency discernment council, an advisory body to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. Aref held different posts during Khatami’s presidency, including the minister of information and communications technology from 1997 to 2000, and vice president from 2001 to 2005. Aref registered as a parliamentary candidate for the 2008 election, but later withdrew to protest the disqualification of reformist candidates by the executive and supervisory boards. Born in 1951 in Iran’s central city of Yazd, Aref holds a doctorate in electrical engineering from Stanford University. He has taught at various Iranian universities since 1982. On 15 February, he attended an event at Amirkabir University along with Ali Motahari demanding the release of Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi, the Green Movement leaders who have been under house arrest since 2011. “The house arrest should either come to an end, or a legal authority should decide upon it,” he said. Aref remains a supporter of Khatami and Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. A reformist candidate, Jelodarzadeh has served as a representative in three different parliaments. She has been the only woman to serve on the parliamentary board of directors, a post she held from 2002-2004. During her time in parliament, Jelodarzadeh focused on the empowerment of women through workforce participation, cautious to remain within the permissible framework emphasizing women’s roles as mothers and homemakers. She advocated women’s access to education and employment, but stressed that such employment should be part-time and not interfere with family-related duties. Jelodarzadeh opposes gender discrimination in the workplace and believes women should be able to work in every sector. In her recent interview with Shargh newspaper, she said she hoped women would occupy 30% of seats in the next parliament. Two terms in office have seen this controversial MP stir blur the line between traditional factional allegiances. Motahari sees himself as both a principlist and a reformist, and has raised the ire of fundamentalists for his criticism of their policies. Unlike the majority of the principlists who have repeatedly condemned the 2009 post-presidential protests in Iran, Motahari has been critical of the government crackdowns on protesters, as well as the house arrest of Green Movement leaders Mousavi, his wife Zahra Rahnavard, and Karroubi. However, Motahari remains a conservative on cultural and social matters, including proper hijab for women. In 2013, he organized a parliament screening in which he showed photos of Iranian women in figure-hugging attire. “The interior minister should explain why he is indifferent to women wearing tights in Tehran and some other cities,” he said. “Since the Islamic revolution, the accepted dress code [for women] has been the chador, or a knee-long manteau, with a headscarf or veil.” Motahari is the son of the noted Islamic scholar Ayatollah Morteza Motahari, who was assassinated in 1979. He is also the brother-in-law of Ali Larijani, another parliamentary candidate and the current speaker of the parliament. Despite his conservative positions, Motahari has often locked horns with right-wing MPs. One parliamentary session last January even resulted in a physical altercation between Motahari and fundamentalists, who attacked him after he demanded the release of Mousavi and Karroubi. Motahari was also physically attacked last March by hardline plainclothesmen in Shiraz . The reformists, meanwhile, have welcomed Motahari to their ranks, adding him to their list of preferred candidates. Earlier this week, Motahari called on Iranians not to vote for those candidates who are against the nuclear deal. A supporter of Rafsanjani and President Hassan Rouhani, Motahari also appears at the top of the list of Sedaye Mellat (the Nation’s Voice), which features a combination of reformist and principlist candidates. Four-time MP Tavakoli is a principlist politician. In 1993 and 1997, he entered the presidential race but lost to Rafsanjani and Khatami, respectively. Tavakoli, who was initially a supporter of former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , but later became one of his fiercest critics, mostly on economic issues. In June 2014, Tavakoli accused Ahmadinejad’s administration of widespread corruption, and said he only voted for Ahmadinejad in 2009 because he believed him to be less of a threat to provoking society against the supreme leader than Mousavi. Tavakoli has been generally supportive of the Rouhani government. Tavakoli has a PhD in economics from the University of Nottingham, where he went on a scholarship from Iran’s ministry of science. His scholarship later became a controversial issue after some accused him of misusing the financial aid. In 2012 he claimed he received the scholarship based upon an order of Ayatollah Khamenei, but offered no further explanation. Currently in parliament, Tavakoli’s name is on the list of candidates promoted by the coalition of principlists. Tavakoli is Larijanis’ second-cousin, and his wife is Larijani’s first cousin. He has seven children. One of his two sons, Zahir, is married to the daughter of Sadegh Zibakalam, a prominent political analyst closely aligned with the reformists. Two-time MP and current parliament speaker, Larijani has sometimes been described as a ‘moderate principlist’ whose political views dovetail with those of pragmatists such as Rouhani. According to Morteza Haji, a reformist politician, Larijani’s support for the nuclear deal and Rouhani’s cabinet weakened his standing among the principlists. Larijani’s name is conspicuously absent from the principlists’ preferred list in Qom, the seat of Iran’s clerical elite, but appears on the preferred list of the conservative group Society of Seminary Teachers of Qom. “I am participating in the election independently, but that doesn’t mean that I am not a principlist,” Larijani said on 12 February. He was deputy chief of staff at the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps from 1982-1992, and served as minister of culture for two years during the presidency of Rafsanjani. In 1994, Ayatollah Khamenei appointed him chief of the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting, a post he held until 2004. On 22 February Iran’s top military man, Quds commander Ghasem Soleimani spoke in praise of Larijani, calling him an influential person when it comes to “regional developments,” and reiterating Larijani’s longtime support of “revolutionary movements.” Larijani is married to Ali Motahari’s sister. His younger brother, Sadegh, is the head of the judiciary, while his older brother, Javad, heads the judiciary’s human rights council. The Larijani family is widely considered to hold Ayatollah Khamenei’s trust on matters. Four-time MP Gholam Ali Haddad Adel is a top advisor to Khamenei. He was parliament speaker between 2005-2008, and is by some estimates geared to replace current speaker Ali Larijani in the next parliament. Haddad Adel is known to be among Khamenei’s circle of confidants. He is a member of the expediency discernment council, whose members are directly appointed by the Supreme Leader. His daughter is married to Mojtaba Khamenei, one of the Supreme Leader’s sons. In 2012, Haddad Adel put himself forward for the speaker seat, but lost the race to Larijani. Ali Motahari, a conservative member of parliament, lashed out against Haddad Adel, calling him unsuitable for the position. “People like Haddad think standing up for people’s rights means is tantamount to acting against the regime,” Motahari said. “These people will resort to any cruelty with the excuse of trying to preserve the regime.” Haddad Adel was born in 1945 in Tehran. He obtained his doctorate in philosophy from Tehran University, where he is still on the faculty of the philosophy department. Beside his education in the social sciences, Haddad Adel also holds a master’s degree in physics. During the past three decades, he held various cabinet positions, including vice minister of culture and Islamic guidance and vice minister of higher education. He also headed Iran’s academy of Persian language and literature. His name is on the preferred list of 30 principlist parliamentary candidates in Tehran. Principlist Eftekhari first won a parliamentary seat in 2004, and has been an MP ever since. She is currently speaker of the women’s faction in parliament, but is often criticized by women’s rights activists for her conservative views. In August 2008, Eftekhari spoke out in support of a controversial section of the family protection law, which allowed men to acquire a second wife without seeking their current wife’s consent: “Based on God’s order and Sharia, a man is not obliged to seek his first wife’s consent to remarry.” In December 2014, she told Adineh Tehran, a weekly, it’s damaging for women to hold “masculine jobs”. A mother of three sons, Eftekhari has a doctorate in theology from Tehran University. Her husband and father were both killed fighting in the Iran-Iraq war. Eftekhari’s name is on the coalition of principlists’ list of preferred candidates."
"John Brennan, Former C.I.A. Spymaster, Steps Out of the Shadows","Feature He quietly ruled the national-security state under President Obama. Now he’s coming forward to rail against Trump — and to defend his own legacy. Supported by By  Mattathias Schwartz O n June 4, John Brennan, the former C.I.A. director, made the long drive from suburban Virginia to New Jersey. He had plans to dine with his brother and an old high school friend. The evening would be a respite from Brennan’s public feud with the president of the United States, whom Brennan unfailingly refers to as “Mr. Trump.” A few days before, Brennan wrote an op-ed calling Trump “a snake-oil salesman.” The paper’s editors tried to persuade Brennan to use the word “president,” but Brennan refused. “I said no, I’m not going to refer to him as ‘president,’ ” Brennan told me. “Because he doesn’t deserve that, in my mind. Yes, he won the most electoral votes. But I think he has demonstrated, over and over again, that he is unfit to carry out the responsibilities of that office.” Trump fired back at Brennan a few hours after the op-ed was published, tweeting out a quote from a former Secret Service agent who had appeared on “Fox & Friends.” Brennan was both a “liar” and “a liar about being a liar,” the guest said. Around 7, Brennan arrived at the restaurant with his brother, Tom, a small-businessman who dabbled in real estate. Wearing crisp shirts tucked into jeans, the brothers could have been mistaken for any two Irish guys from North Jersey who made good. Brennan waved across the bar to his old friend Mike, an off-duty bartender nursing a pint of Guinness. Mike sat behind John during homeroom at their Catholic high school. “Room 204, Brother Christopher,” recalled Brennan, a collector of details. The brothers ordered two more, and the three men repaired to a table by the window, overlooking the street. They talked about their summer plans, who was sick, who was well, old rock concerts they’d been to — the Who, Mountain, the Rolling Stones at Madison Square Garden — and how much had changed since the old days. Mike told a story about Chuck Wepner, the inspiration for Rocky Balboa, whom they knew from their boyhood summers on the Jersey Shore. “He had a very marginal career, but he fought Ali,” said Tom. “He could take a punch,” said Brennan. Brennan himself could pass for a retired boxer. He is now 62, and his face seems to bear the evidence of some long struggle, its overhanging brows draping the eyes in shadow. He stands just over six feet tall, with broad shoulders and a gait marked by three hip replacements and multiple knee surgeries. Brennan served through the entire Obama presidency, first as the White House counterterrorism czar, then as director of the C.I.A. A Middle East specialist and trained Arabic speaker, he was involved in decision-making about Osama bin Laden, the Arab Spring, Benghazi, ISIS, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Syria, the Iran deal and Russian election meddling. Ben Rhodes, Obama’s aide and speechwriter, calls Brennan “the principal architect” of the administration’s drone policy and “in some ways, the White House’s principal liaison to the intelligence community” during Brennan’s years in the White House. Micah Zenko, an expert on drone policy and a fellow at the British think tank Chatham House, calls Brennan “the most lethal bureaucrat of all time, or at least since Henry Kissinger, who would pick up the phone and implore military commanders to bomb grids in northern Vietnam.” Now Brennan was out, having traded world-bestriding power for a handful of gigs: adviser on world events for clients of Kissinger Associates, visiting scholar at Fordham University and the University of Texas, commentator on breaking news for MSNBC. A few of Brennan’s colleagues from the Obama years said that I should be careful not to judge him by appearances. The dagger-eyed enforcer I had seen glowering behind the table in Senate committee hearings, they insisted, was not the man they knew. Indeed, Brennan’s voice is softer than his face, and different from the streetwise directness of his brother. It is the voice of a mild-mannered civil servant — cerebral, courtly, deferential and exquisitely self-conscious. “He’s so shy, in one sense,” former Vice President Joe Biden told me. “He’s not a gregarious guy.” The light residue of his New Jersey accent seems almost aristocratic; when he drops a syllable from government to make gub-ment, it sounds like a well-worn pet name. The Brennans ordered mussels and steaks. Mike got half a rack of ribs. By the time the food came, the talk had turned to Trump. Mike said he had heard a story about the Trump Organization stiffing a friend of a friend on a sizable landscaping bill. “I was sitting in my kitchen with my wife,” Brennan said. “I said to Kathy, ‘If there were any other president who criticized me privately, much less publicly, I’d be devastated.’ I really would. Mr. Trump criticizing me? That’s a badge of honor. And the fact that he is, you know, busying himself with tweeting against me? When he said, a few days before, he goes: ‘I’m going to have to focus on North Korea and Russia. I’ve got to get back to work.’ And then what does he do? His subsequent 20 or 30 tweets are all about Crooked Hillary, or the unconstitutionality of the special counsel. He has this obsession, this manic obsession with, understandably, his fate. Because I think he knows what he’s guilty of. He knows what he has done wrong. And he’s finding that it’s more difficult now to squirm out of it than it has been in the past.” Trump has tried to capitalize on Brennan’s involvement in the Russia probe, tweeting out his theories about a C.I.A.-and-F.B.I.-led conspiracy he calls “Spygate.” In Trump’s view, the Justice Department’s investigation of his ties to Russia is a plot by the so-called deep state to undermine his presidency. As evidence, he has offered a series of anti-Trump text messages exchanged by several senior F.B.I. employees who worked on the Clinton email and Russia investigations. Trump has also seized on the revelation of an informant, tasked by the F.B.I. to ask campaign associates about Russia’s hacking of Democratic emails in order to see if they had knowledge of it. Trump has insisted that the investigation was undertaken not because there was a reason to suspect his campaign may have colluded with Russia but because Democrats paid Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence official, to write a “phony,” “fake” 35-page dossier of salacious allegations about Trump and Russia. Instead of dealing with the very real evidence that Russia helped get him elected, Trump prefers to believe that Brennan and his all-powerful C.I.A. were pulling the strings. While Trump’s theories surrounding the election are half-baked demagogy, he has reason to be preoccupied with Brennan. As Obama’s C.I.A. director, Brennan would have read the top-secret reports supporting the intelligence community’s public conclusion that Vladimir Putin favored Trump and sought to manipulate American voters to elect him. According to The Guardian, Brennan received early intelligence tips from his British counterparts about suspicious contacts between Russia and Trump’s campaign. In summer 2016, he shared that intelligence with the F.B.I. director at the time, James Comey, just as the bureau’s investigation was getting underway. With his Spygate allegations, Trump has tried to turn the Russia investigation into a national referendum on the credibility of the intelligence community, with Brennan and Comey in the starring roles. He seems to sense that many find the C.I.A. and F.B.I. to be fundamentally untrustworthy, and that by attacking them, by forcing people to choose between trusting Brennan and trusting Trump, he could destroy the fragile notion that there is any truth in public life at all. Few things bother Brennan more than being called a liar. At the C.I.A., he tried to frame espionage as an honorable vocation. He made a high-profile push to reorganize the agency and stepped up recruitment of and support for racial, sexual and gender minorities. He called his staff “intelligence professionals,” rarely using the word “spy.” “We don’t steal secrets,” he once said . “We uncover, we discover, we reveal, we obtain, we elicit, we solicit.” But from time to time, he bent the truth in ways that are not uncommon for C.I.A. directors and high-ranking presidential aides. Brennan’s evasions differ from Trump’s lies — they are smaller, less frequent, more deniable. Brennan once asserted that nearly a full year of drone strikes had not killed a single civilian. After the killing of Osama bin Laden, he told reporters that the Qaeda leader had personally “engaged in a firefight” when in fact he was unarmed. (Brennan says he was conveying what he’d heard from Adm. William McRaven, who organized and led the operation. McRaven told me that he told Brennan the Navy SEALs “fought their way up the stairs. I didn’t mean to imply they had been in a firefight with bin Laden.” The miscommunication, he added, was “solely my responsibility.”) Brennan strenuously resisted admitting fault after the C.I.A. probed into the computers of the Senate staff members who were investigating the post-9/11 torture program. He gave the public a sanitized version of the truth and withheld the full one. He did things that the president wanted done but not known. And now, as a private citizen, he was asking the people to believe him about “Mr. Trump.” At dinner, there was a round of wine, and the conversation drifted toward the ad hominem. At one point, some of the saltier remarks caused Brennan to chuckle with mild embarrassment and drop his napkin over my iPhone, which was recording the conversation. Mike and Tom wanted to show me whose side they were on; Brennan was trying to show them respect while keeping them from going too far. “He has been married three times,” Mike said. “He cheated on his prior wife. Oh, but he’s a family man.” “I can’t understand how the evangelicals and the Christian right put up with his antics,” Brennan said. “They make excuses!” Tom said. “His — he’s a Christian?” Brennan asked, in wonderment. The New Jersey in him seemed ready to continue roughhousing. But moments later, his Washingtonian restraint kicked in. “This, too, shall pass,” he said abruptly. The table fell silent. The waitress came, and the men ordered a round of Irish whiskeys. Brennan’s public feud with Trump was just beginning when we first met for coffee in February in a hotel lobby in Norfolk, Va. He had come to Norfolk, home to the largest naval base in the country, to give a public speech for some 2,000 ticketholders. I had come to ask Brennan about Obama’s legacy, but Russia was dominating the national conversation. That morning on Twitter, while waiting to catch his flight in from Washington, Brennan threw a punch at the president: “It never ceases to amaze me how successful you have been making yourself so small, petty and banal with your tweets. Your insecurity is well deserved, as is your concern over Russia investigation.” Brennan told me that he didn’t plan to serve up any red-meat harangues in his speech that night. “I don’t focus on Donald Trump at all,” he said. “I will speak about what’s going on in the world. I will speak about the things that concern me.” Hours later, Brennan gussied himself up in a tuxedo and enamel cuff links bearing the seal of the C.I.A. Standing onstage at Chrysler Hall, he shifted his bulk from one tasseled black loafer to the other, hardly looking down at the notecards he held in front of his cummerbund. The employees of the C.I.A., he said, belonged to a “profession,” not some “rogue organization.” Globalization, he said, was both inevitable and desirable, though its benefits were unevenly distributed, leading to inequality, migration, populism and the decline of liberal democracy. As the audience warmed to Brennan, his resolve to avoid Trump-related topics began to slip. Twenty minutes on, he raised the possibility of “an eligibility requirement for people to run for office, not just here but around the globe,” mandating that candidates display “a familiarity with history, the Constitution, world events.” This brought laughter and some applause. He did not mention Trump by name until late in the Q. and A., when asked if his speaking on political issues might undermine the C.I.A. and call its neutrality into question. “Sometimes my Irishness comes up,” Brennan replied. He denied that his critiques of Trump were motivated by partisanship. He talked about Trump’s use of the C.I.A.’s Memorial Wall, which honors the agency’s fallen, as a backdrop for bragging about the crowds at his inauguration. He recalled Trump’s incendiary comments after the fatal protests in Charlottesville. “I’m going to continue to speak out, because I think we’re at a critical stage in our nation’s history,” Brennan said. “When I see there is dishonesty and a lack of integrity, yeah, I speak out.” Brennan’s willingness to trade blows with Trump is a break from the pattern set by former C.I.A. directors, who have largely stayed quiet during retirement, especially on classified matters that they were personally involved in only months before. In the weeks following the speech, Brennan took aim at many facets of Trump’s presidency — his exit of the Iran deal, his blind loyalty to Israel, his disrespect of alliances, his vicious anti-immigrant rhetoric. But at the core of his attack was Donald Trump the person. Brennan’s argument, culminating in the op-ed, was that Trump’s coarse, selfish and undignified character made him unfit for the job. “If there is a scintilla of decency left in you,” he tweeted on June 16 , responding to a Trump boast about his poll numbers, “you would focus on your responsibilities, not on yourself.” Brennan has also alluded to what might come out in the investigation by the special counsel, Robert Mueller, about the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia. “I’m not going to get into what I may have known or not known while I was the C.I.A. director,” he told NPR’s Mary Louise Kelly . “Is he afraid that Mr. Putin might have something on him? Maybe. I don’t know, but only Mr. Trump knows what he might be vulnerable to.” By dropping hints like these, Brennan has only fanned the flames of mistrust among Trump and his supporters. The segment of Trump voters who bought into “ Pizzagate ” — the infamous conspiracy theory that imagined a powerful pedophile ring at a Washington pizza restaurant — and tune into Alex Jones’s Infowars is now eager to believe in Spygate. But in a curious sense, the wellspring of fear that makes Spygate plausible to frightened outsiders is a mirror image of the disgust that Brennan, the consummate insider, expresses about the president’s character. Over decades, but accelerating in the years since 9/11, the executive branch’s ability to conduct national security with little transparency or oversight has grown steadily, to the point that the president and his advisers wield powers that are incomprehensible to the layperson and daunting even to elected officials who might like to rein those powers in. The more imperial the executive has become, the harder it is to grapple with what any administration is actually doing in real time, and the more public debate is reduced to the question of whether the president and his team can be trusted as human beings. It is hard for Trump to make the case for his own trustworthiness, given his erratic moods, frightening rhetoric and gleeful betrayals. Some in Congress, like Representatives Trey Gowdy and Paul Ryan, have defended the F.B.I.’s Russia investigation and pushed back against the Spygate narrative. “A confidential informant is not a spy,” says Senator Lindsey Graham , undermining Spygate’s central premise. But others want to take seriously the possibility that candidate Trump fell victim to those same imperial powers that Brennan encouraged Obama to use. “There is virtually no abuse of civil liberties that John Brennan hasn’t been a part of,” Senator Rand Paul told me by email, citing drone strikes, torture and surveillance. Later, he called on Brennan to testify publicly about “any secret info on candidate Trump ... from European or British intelligence sources.” Brennan’s warnings about Trump seemed at risk of getting lost in the noise, one among many competing sets of allegations. “I think his credibility is zero,” Brennan said on MSNBC , hours after the North Korea summit. “He continually lies to the American people and to the public,” he thundered. “How can anybody believe what he is saying?” His jabs were getting sharper and snappier; he was adapting to a media environment in which points don’t land without repetition and hyperbole. He was, in other words, beginning to sound more like his tweets, and perhaps just a bit like Donald Trump. Brennan’s father, Owen, was a blacksmith who immigrated to New Jersey from Ireland in 1948. Owen’s own father, Brennan told me, was “a supporter, an affiliate, say,” of the Irish Republican Army. Brennan moved twice while growing up, from one apartment to another before settling in a three-family house in North Bergen. His grandmother lived on the top floor. “My dad worked construction in those years,” Tom remembers. “Those jobs were not easy to come by.” When the construction business slowed down, Owen would find odd jobs. For a time, he commuted into Manhattan to fold papers for The Daily News. The Brennans scrimped so John and his brother and sister could be taught by Franciscan nuns, who made heaven and hell as tangible as two neighborhood subway lines. Brennan resolved to go to heaven, and the priesthood seemed like a sure way of getting there. He read about the popes and noticed that there had never been an American one. He decided that he would be the first. “If you’re going to be a priest, why not aspire to be the highest priest there is?” he told me. As a teenager, even as he absorbed his parents’ morality and work ethic, Brennan felt torn between the cloistered priesthood and a life of worldly experience, between pleasing his parents and escaping into a world that was larger than New Jersey. He read Saint Augustine and Hermann Hesse. He found a mentor in his cousin Thomas, who had traveled to Malaysia and Vietnam and was stationed in Indonesia, working at U.S.A.I.D. Thomas mailed back reel-to-reel audio recordings recounting his travels. On Sundays, after church, the family would gather around the kitchen table at Thomas’s father’s house to listen to them. Thomas told the family how lucky they were to be living in the free world, where there was adequate food and shelter and real opportunity. John wanted to follow Thomas’s example. He applied to and was accepted by the Georgetown School of Foreign Service but could not attend; the tuition was too high. Instead, he enrolled at Fordham, a Catholic university on the other side of the Hudson. He took the bus to school and worked nights at a supermarket deli. He devoted himself to studying Arabic and spent part of his junior year in Cairo. A few years later, in 1980, as a graduate student in political science at the University of Texas at Austin, Brennan would write his master’s thesis on the state of human rights in Egypt, under the rule of Anwar Sadat. The thesis grapples with a thorny problem of United States policy in the Middle East — how much repression by our allies is tolerable? Brennan responded to the problem with equivocation. In his view, Sadat’s repression of radical groups and censoring of the press was justifiable for the sake of “the preservation of democracy.” Other measures, like interfering with elections, were unjustifiable “regime perpetuation.” In the case of Egypt, he found, the ends do justify the means, but only sometimes. Back in New Jersey, Brennan married his hometown girlfriend. They had met at a bar in Edgewater; years before, Brennan played Little League baseball with her older brother. As Brennan tells it, he applied to join the C.I.A. around this time, after seeing a newspaper ad. An interviewer strapped his arm to a polygraph machine and asked if he had ever been a member of an organization that sought to overthrow the government of the United States. Brennan, not wanting to carry even the smallest deception on his conscience, said that he voted for Gus Hall, the Communist Party candidate for president, in 1976. (Decades later, Brennan volunteered the story of his Communist vote to a young woman who had asked him if participating in protests might disqualify her from working for the C.I.A. Reports of Brennan’s vote reached right-wing critics of the Obama administration, who tried to use this nearly 40-year-old vote as evidence of ongoing Communist sympathies. Brennan now says that it was cast in protest against the partisanship of the Watergate era.) At the C.I.A., Brennan quickly distinguished himself as a “deep select,” a young officer given extra visibility and fast promotions. After a tour in Saudi Arabia, he grew close to George Tenet, who was working at the National Security Council as a liaison between the C.I.A. and the Clinton White House, where Brennan sometimes delivered the president’s daily brief. Tenet became Clinton’s third C.I.A. director in 1997, and George W. Bush kept him on. Tenet had repeatedly tried to warn Bush’s team about the growing Qaeda threat, but not everyone shared his sense of urgency. Tenet and Bush took their failure to stop the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, personally. Waves of guilt and panic poured down through the C.I.A.’s hierarchy as rumors spread that there might be a second wave of attacks. “I remember going into the counterterrorism center,” says Jami Miscik, who led the C.I.A. Directorate of Intelligence at the time. “The analysts had their children sleeping on the floor. It was such an intense effort.” The atmosphere was one of ongoing crisis; high officials began to make distinctions between what was legal and what was right. Scraps of intelligence seemed to point toward terrifying hypotheticals: What if the C.I.A. got its hands on a Qaeda suspect who knew about a dirty bomb about to go off in New York City? The White House authorized the C.I.A. to carry out waterboardings, sensory deprivation and prolonged stress positions. At the time, they were known as Enhanced Interrogation Techniques, or E.I.T.s; eventually most everyone outside the C.I.A. would come to acknowledge them as forms of torture. After Gina Haspel, the current C.I.A director, faced tough questioning in the Senate over her role in the use of E.I.T.s, she wrote a letter stating that “the enhanced interrogation program is not one the C.I.A. should have undertaken,” given “the benefit of hindsight.” The letter stops short of expressing any regret. Brennan has had to walk a similar tightrope about his own record on waterboarding. Immediately after 9/11, he was the fourth-highest official in the C.I.A.’s hierarchy, responsible for logistics, budgets and personnel. Though he has said that he was not in the operational chain of command, he was copied on at least 50 internal C.I.A. emails describing the interrogation of one detainee. Unlike Obama, who admitted that “we tortured some folks,” he has refrained from referring to waterboarding as “torture.” But Brennan has repeatedly claimed that he took issue with the practice at the time, although he “did not try to stop it.” The three people who were above him at C.I.A. say they do not remember him giving voice to any qualms he might have had. I asked Brennan who else might remember him speaking up at that time. “I’m not going to say that I told Mary, Joe and Sue,” Brennan replied. “It wasn’t as though I was wearing that opposition on my sleeve throughout the agency. I expressed it privately, to individuals.” Tensions between the Bush White House and the C.I.A. reached a head over the 2003 decision to invade Iraq. After C.I.A. analysts refused to validate a nonexistent connection in Prague between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda, the Bush White House settled on the theory that Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. After the invasion, when the W.M.D.s failed to turn up, Bush’s team scapegoated Tenet over what he had supposedly called “slam dunk” intelligence to support the W.M.D. theory. Tenet, who wrote in his memoirs that “slam dunk” actually referred to something else, retired in 2004; Brennan left the agency the following year. The lesson for Brennan’s generation of C.I.A. officers was a demoralizing one — that serving the president could sometimes mean acting as political cannon fodder when things went wrong. In 2008, three weeks after Barack Obama won the Iowa caucuses, Brennan gave $2,300, then the legal maximum, to his campaign. Outside government for the first time since college, Brennan had spent a few years as head of the Analysis Corporation, selling contracts for custom software that the government could use to manage terrorist watch-lists. By the time of Obama’s Iowa win, he was one of a few former national-security officials who advised the candidate and his inner circle through email lists and conference calls. “It was important that someone with John’s counterterrorism credentials threw his weight behind Obama,” says Samantha Power, who later served as Obama’s ambassador to the United Nations. “Obama was seen by some as a community organizer who had been on the Hill for all of five minutes. John was a validator with real street cred in the national-security community.” Biden concurs: “Everyone knew John was a hard-ass,” he says. “He knew the intelligence community. He was a great asset for the president to have.” Brennan met Obama for the first time in Chicago during the transition and quickly won him over. They shared grievances about the Iraq war and what Brennan now calls “a very strong alignment of views” on counterterrorism, “in terms of how aggressive to be — to do everything possible to protect American lives, without making the problem worse.” Both believed that American relations with the Arab world depended on making it clear that the United States could go to war with terrorism while making peace with Islam. At first, Brennan wanted to be C.I.A. director, but he withdrew his name when liberal commentators started to scrutinize his post-9/11 record at the C.I.A. Instead, he became Obama’s “counterterrorism czar.” By dint of hard work and proximity to the White House decision-making process, his power would come to surpass that of most cabinet members. Brennan and Obama “had a mind meld,” says Gen. James Clapper, who was the director of national intelligence under Obama. “Almost like finishing each other’s sentences.” Brennan held the title of assistant to the president and sat on both the National Security Council and its influential deputies’ committee. When the time came to decide whether to sign off on a drone strike, Brennan would brief Obama on the intelligence and guide him through the decision, sometimes late at night, in the East Wing residence. With that, the C.I.A. had acquired a powerful ally with daily access to the president. In hindsight, the list of deliverables that Obama promised under the banner of Change may have been overambitious: Exit the bad war in Iraq. Win the good war in Afghanistan. Close Guantánamo. Ban torture, and pursue a “reckoning” for the torturers, in the words of Obama’s soon-to-be attorney general, Eric Holder. What’s more, Obama said he would reform the habit of unnecessary state secrecy that had given rise to such malignant policies. “It’s no coincidence that one of the most secretive administrations in history” pursued policies “that could not stand up to sunlight,” Obama said, slamming Bush on the campaign trail. The day after his inauguration, Obama signed a memo called “Transparency and Open Government” that promised to create “an unprecedented level of openness” and “disclose information rapidly.” A second Obama memo about public information requests asserted that, “in the face of doubt, openness prevails”; requests should be responded to “promptly and in a spirit of cooperation.” Obama’s transparency phase did not last long. His administration secretly subpoenaed reporters’ phone records and brought at least nine leak-related prosecutions, more than all previous administrations combined. The spirit of cooperation had long fled the scene by his final summer, when I visited his chief of staff at the time, Denis McDonough — a lean, gray-haired man in his 40s whose weary eyes suggested that those who had stuck with Obama through all eight years were now running on fumes. He grew up in an Irish-Catholic family with 11 children in Minnesota and became close to Brennan during Obama’s first term. Each had a small, windowless chamber in the basement beneath the Oval Office. In those days, Brennan would wake just after 4 in the morning and work in his basement West Wing office until 9 or 10 each night. Back home, he would continue working in his secure basement office and retire around midnight. During crises, he would sometimes forgo the commute and sleep in his chair. Vacation meant following the Obamas to Martha’s Vineyard and taking his own family along. “The president trusted John inherently, and I don’t think he ever felt that trust was misplaced,” McDonough told me later. “He was absolutely critical to President Obama’s success.” Eight minutes into my allotted 10 with McDonough, I spoke two words — “signature strikes” — and was met with a gentle interruption. “Why don’t you ask a different question?” McDonough said. “Because I’m not going to answer a question on something like that.” At the end of Obama’s second term, most of the public remained unaware of the existence of “signature strikes” — the killing of suspected militants whose identities are unknown, but who are deemed to be valid targets based on certain predetermined criteria, or “signatures.” Signatures can come from a connection to a suspected terrorist phone number, a suspected Al Qaeda camp or the fact that a person is armed. “It could be a bunch of guys on a hillside doing a live fire exercise and speaking Uzbek,” said a former administration official, who requested anonymity to discuss matters that are still nominally secret. The official added: “There are practical and legal problems with that.” Under Obama, the C.I.A. had authority to conduct many signature strikes without case-by-case presidential approval. The practice led to accusations that the C.I.A., to artificially suppress civilian casualty numbers, was deeming any unidentified military-age male killed in a strike zone as a presumed militant. Further confusing matters, officials can designate new areas to be “areas of active hostilities” or temporary war zones in places like Libya and Somalia. The term “signature strike” only applies outside of war zones; inside of these areas the rules are significantly looser. The lack of transparency around drone strikes made it hard to understand, let alone defend, United States policy. “The biggest conflict I had with my leadership was drone strikes,” says one former diplomat who worked in South Asia during Obama’s first term. “Official U.S. government policy is that you can’t talk about them, because they don’t exist,” the diplomat continued. “I quickly realized that I couldn’t be a credible representative of the U.S. government without talking about what was on the front page of every single newspaper.” Under Obama, the justification for holding such unaccountable power was the good character of the president and his staff. “Do I want this system to last forever? No,” one senior Obama official told The Washington Post in 2012 , referring to the drone program. “What is scary is the apparatus set up without John to run it.” If McDonough could not talk about signature strikes, perhaps he could talk about drone strikes against “high-value targets,” named and known terrorists. “Again, that sounds to me like a question that I’m not in a position to respond to,” McDonough replied. What did Brennan eat for lunch? “John ate soup.” McDonough made it clear that he does not look down on soup: “The soups here are excellent.” And then, lest I think a White House job consisted of lazing around and gorging on the many delectable soups: “He would eat at his desk.” And then, lest I think Brennan was a slob: “He is a fastidious character.” Each of his qualifications regarding Brennan’s lunch habits nested neatly into the previous one. This was a polished specimen of Obama-era rhetoric, a series of equivocations bent into the shape of a paper clip. “They were trying to have it both ways,” says Gen. Stanley McChrystal, who led Obama’s campaign in Afghanistan until mid-2010. “They were trying to convince the hard-liners that we’re doing enough and trying to convince the Islamic world that we’re not doing too much. But it takes more than drone strikes to solve these problems. You have got to stop people from wanting to be terrorists.” If Brennan played a role in acclimating Obama to the dark necessities of counterterrorism, so did unfolding events. His first year was marked by a mass shooting at Fort Hood and the “underwear bomber,” a terrifying close call in which a Nigerian national almost succeeded in detonating explosives aboard a Northwest Airlines flight to Detroit. There were intense disputes between the White House and the Pentagon over troop levels as the Afghanistan war began to look like a quagmire. Obama “did not want to be L.B.J.,” McChrystal says. “He did not want to lead America into a never-ending war.” But Afghanistan “felt a lot like Vietnam. You just couldn’t get around it. It was a really difficult thing for the administration.” Drones offered Obama a third way, between the bloodletting of a traditional ground war and the embarrassment of retreat. Brennan served as a crucial mediator between the hard-liners on the ground and White House insiders who favored a more judicious approach. “John got a reputation on the left as the guy who was overzealous in his use of drones, when in fact he was doing a lot to constrain them,” Ben Rhodes says. “He was definitely tapping the brakes.” As Obama’s confidence in Brennan grew, so did Brennan’s portfolio. He soon emerged not just as Obama’s chief drone warrior but also as a shadow envoy to much of the Middle East. He helped frame Obama’s landmark Cairo address, intended to reset United States relations with the Muslim world. He hand-delivered a letter from Obama to the embattled president of Yemen. In 2010, Brennan reportedly received a tip from Saudi intelligence that stopped the bombing of two United States-bound cargo planes. In 2013, he met with the Israeli prime minister and military chiefs to coordinate approaches to Syria. He wrangled with difficult allies in Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Egypt. As the Syria conflict deepened and Obama drew criticism for his indecision, The Times reported that Brennan’s C.I.A. undertook a billion-dollar covert campaign to arm and train rebels fighting against the Syrian leader, Bashar al-Assad. In May 2011, Brennan helped oversee the operation to kill Osama bin Laden, staying at the White House for three straight days. “John was meticulous in his stewardship of that process,” Rhodes recalls. The operation was risky. The trickiest variable was whether the tall man living in the Abbottabad compound was actually bin Laden. During the planning phase, Brennan made it clear that if the gamble failed, the Iraq debacle would not be repeated. This time no one would be blamed for having gotten the intelligence wrong. “If we go in and bin Laden is not there, that would not be an intelligence failure,” Brennan said at a deputies’ committee meeting, according to Michael Morell, deputy director of the C.I.A. at the time. Later that year, Brennan was involved in the decision to kill Anwar al-Awlaki, a United States citizen, whose killing was justified by two legal memos from Obama’s Office of Legal Counsel. The memos found that either the C.I.A. or the military could kill al-Awlaki without violating his constitutional right to due process or the federal ban on assassinations. Awlaki’s 16-year-old son, Abdulrahman, was also killed in Yemen, in a separate drone strike weeks later. Administration officials said that he was not the intended target. With bin Laden and al-Awlaki dead, Obama set about restraining the drone program in earnest. He had Brennan draw up a Presidential Policy Guidance, or P.P.G. For drone strikes conducted outside war zones, it required two forms of “near certainty”: first, that a target was present; and second, that no civilians would be killed. There was discussion of further reforms: An external body might be convened to approve individual drone strikes, or to review them after the fact. Signature strikes might come to an end. The C.I.A. might lose its drone program altogether. None of these changes wound up happening. The P.P.G. rule book, coupled with Brennan’s move from the White House to leadership of the C.I.A. in 2013, does seem to have had some effect; the number of drone strikes in Pakistan fell sharply. Outside Pakistan, however, the war on terror continued, driven especially by the rise of the Islamic State. Drones allowed Obama to reduce troop deployments and United States casualties, even as the geographic scope of the campaign spread to places like Libya and Somalia. In all, what Obama left behind was a troubling inheritance — vast, secret and mostly unilateral powers to spy and to kill in the name of fighting the global war on terror, powers that depend more on the good intentions of those who wield them than on any written law. Listening to Obama’s early rhetoric, it was easy to think that he was going to do something to pare those powers back and remove the country from its permanent post-9/11 war footing. The war against Al Qaeda would continue, he said, but with “an abiding confidence in the rule of law and due process; in checks and balances and accountability.” He would pursue “the strongest and most sustainable legal framework,” a legacy “that outlasts my administration, my presidency, that endures for the next president and the president after that.” But in the end, Obama’s record on counterterrorism was one of continuity, not change. Guantánamo shrank; it did not close. Obama responded to Edward Snowden’s disclosures by throwing his weight behind the National Security Agency. The C.I.A. kept its drones and signature strikes. Efforts that might have been intended to scale back the drone program wound up codifying it; the series of speeches that Obama presented as part of his “framework” — road maps to reform — had the effect of normalizing and putting a humane face on a policy of quasi assassination. During the final months of Obama’s second term came a gesture toward transparency, an executive order requiring the White House to release annually the number of noncombatants killed by drone strikes outside war zones. Their estimates for Obama’s years in office were far lower than those compiled by outside groups. To his successor, Obama bequeathed a much larger counterterrorism apparatus than he himself had inherited; Trump set about making full use of its powers while shaking off Obama’s self-imposed restraints. According to reports in The Times, Trump secretly replaced the P.P.G. , ending the centralized Obama-era strike-approval process and lowering a threshold for killing from the P.P.G.’s “near certainty” that the intended target was present to “reasonable certainty.” (The “near certainty” requirement for no civilian casualties remained in place.) Kill decisions that would have required White House approval were pushed down the chain of command into the Pentagon and C.I.A. Trump seemed keen to deliver on a campaign promise to kill not just ISIS fighters but also those around them. “We’re fighting a very politically correct war,” he said during the campaign. “You have to take out their families.” In Somalia, the number of drone strikes doubled during Trump’s first year, according to a report by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism. In Yemen, drone strikes tripled. According to The Washington Post, the C.I.A. showed Trump a video of a strike where operators waited to fire until the target had moved a safe distance away from his family. “Why did you wait?” Trump reportedly asked . While Brennan has seized on reports of Trump’s personal crudeness and his bad behavior around the Russia investigation, he has been mostly silent about Trump’s approach to drones. After I sent a question to Obama (who declined to be interviewed) on whether he had concerns about Trump’s use of “the authorities that you wielded,” Brennan was the one to respond. He said he was “disturbed” by press reports on the loosening of Obama’s standards and that “every effort must be made to avoid civilian casualties.” As eager as he was to question Trump’s character, he wasn’t yet ready to question the system under which a demagogue like Trump could wield so much unchecked power. By the time I met Brennan, I had spoken to several former officials who said that the P.P.G. was never intended to tie the hands of Obama’s successor. Such a thing was impossible; the president was the president and could do whatever he wanted. But multiple people involved with its drafting said they saw value in establishing a precedent that the incoming administration would have to make an active decision to throw out. “It’s like building a dam,” says Harold Koh, who worked closely with Brennan and served as the State Department’s chief lawyer during Obama’s first term. “If you try to build too high, it takes too long and never gets finished. But if a flood comes and overwhelms it, some people will say, why didn’t we build a higher dam? John did his best.” In late April, I met Brennan for lunch at a Morton’s Steakhouse in Northern Virginia. He sat down in the booth and ordered a Diet Coke with lime. That morning, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, led by one of Trump’s most devoted supporters, Representative Devin Nunes, had released a 253-page report that found no evidence of direct ties between Trump’s campaign and the Russian government. It cited testimony that Brennan had given on the Hill, in which he said, “I don’t know whether or not such collusion — that’s your term — existed.” At lunch, Brennan sounded a more suggestive note, telling me he had “serious questions about the extent of that interaction, cooperation, collusion.” He was careful to attribute this sentiment to “what I’ve been reading in the press.” “I try to be careful with the language that I use,” he said. “When people ask me questions, for example, about why is Mr. Trump so submissive to Vladimir Putin, and whether or not Mr. Trump fears that the Russians have something on him, I say, I don’t know. Perhaps. Maybe. I just don’t want to get into details about what I know or don’t know.” He added: “I have to be very mindful of my obligations as far as classified material is concerned.” The waitress returned. Brennan ordered crab cakes. I brought up drone strikes. Trump, it seemed, was making full use of the presidential power to kill. “What a president does during his or her term is subject to being modified, if not overturned, by successors,” Brennan said. “There was no illusion, nor could there have been, that what he put into place would” — and here he paused and looked up at the ceiling — “definitely stay in place in the subsequent administration.” He took a bite of crab cake. “Is there greater tolerance for civilian casualties? Maybe. Sounds like it.” He said he had heard reports from journalists of high civilian casualties in Mosul. Some reports have put the figure as high as 10,000. He said that he found those reports to be concerning. “But I don’t know the details of it,” he added. I asked Brennan about his own decision-making process. His answer suggested a possible reason that he hasn’t been outspoken regarding Trump’s drone policy: He had some degree of confidence, he said, in Gen. John Kelly, Trump’s chief of staff, who had served as an aide to two of Obama’s secretaries of defense. Brennan said he and Kelly had “spent a lot of time on the phone” during Obama’s first term, in “late-night calls, early-morning calls.” Again, with the decisions themselves hidden, the character of the decision maker loomed large. At lunch, Brennan talked about how he would take kill decisions to Obama. “There were recommendations I made that went both ways,” he said. “To take action or not take action, that I remember very well. Each of which had consequences. But if you’re not prepared to live with those consequences, then you probably shouldn’t be in those positions. Because. ... ” The food was gone and the straw from his Diet Coke lay on the table. He picked it up and began twisting it in his hands. “I agonize over them. I agonize over the decisions. I’m not saying every decision I made was perfect. By no means. It never will be.” Information was often incomplete or dated, he said. The P.P.G. was an attempt to systematize those hard calls. “That was where we were in the Obama administration,” he said. “We wanted to have that rigor.” The most famous case in which things went wrong was a 2015 drone strike in Pakistan . Along with the intended Qaeda targets, the strike killed two Western aid workers being held hostage: Giovanni Lo Porto, an Italian, and Warren Weinstein, an American. An internal review conducted by the C.I.A. reportedly concluded that there had been no error on the part of the operators. All procedures had been followed and the near-certainty standard had been met. Jason Amerine, a retired lieutenant colonel from the Army Special Forces who had been searching for Weinstein along with other hostages, told me that his team assessed in 2013 that drone strikes were “the No. 1 risk to hostages.” Amerine said he blamed the bureaucracy, not the C.I.A. “They didn’t know any better,” he said. “It’s tragic.” In the White House, Brennan took responsibility for Weinstein’s death, according to one person who was present. He personally apologized to Obama and briefed him on it, twice, in exhaustive detail. Over lunch, Brennan did not deny that this had happened but declined to share his side. “People will tell you whatever they want,” he said. “There are certain things I’m not going to get into.” Maybe he could speak in more general terms? “Sometimes, in war, things happen,” he said. “I don’t think I ever said that precision means it’s going to be foolproof, or collateral-free.” Most nights, he said, he would immediately fall asleep at the end of a 20-hour workday. But sometimes the day’s decisions would keep him up. “I would agonize over them,” he said. “Rethink and rethink and rethink. Wonder whether or not I had made the right recommendation, the right decision. If I had heard that something didn’t go as we had planned, I would continue to review it in my mind. What could we have done better? What went wrong? Why did I make that decision?” Why hadn’t Obama gotten rid of signature strikes? “When you say that signature strikes were supposed to come to an end, I don’t recall that ever being something that was on the table,” he said. He pulled back a bit to give his view of signature strikes, a term that was “the parlance of the media.” You may not know the target’s name, but you might have other information, he said. You might know that they were determined to carry out an attack, that they were “dirty as hell,” sometimes even “full Al Qaeda members.” You could still have near certainty. “There was never an intention on the part of the counterterrorism folks in the Obama administration to end signature strikes,” he said. “That is just wrong.” Brennan said he shared Obama’s position that the military alone should be responsible for drone strikes. Like others I spoke to from the Obama White House, he said this change failed to happen because of a lack of cooperation from Congress. “I’m not acknowledging that C.I.A. has ever had a drone program,” he added, making it clear that he would not discuss what was still classified. I brought up the Obama administration’s official tally of civilian drone victims and its wide divergence from estimates made by outside groups. “Are the numbers 100 percent accurate?” Brennan replied. “No. I’m certain they are not. They’re as close as we could get to an honest representation of combatant and noncombatant deaths. Might not the numbers be a little bit higher on the civilian side? Yeah, they might be. But we really tried to be as honest as possible with it. It’s hard to convince people of the care that is taken, of the anxiety, of the rigor that is applied. Of the deep, deep consideration that is given to these decisions. Of the agony that decision makers or operators go through.” Did that sense of moral seriousness still prevail under Trump? “I would like to think that nobody would want to kill an innocent person,” Brennan said. “That nobody would treat this responsibility and these capabilities cavalierly. Unfortunately, I think, sometimes in war, people will have greater tolerance for the deaths of civilians. Because they believe that the end justifies the means. And to me, I think, all life is sacred. Whether you’re a Syrian who is hunkered down in Raqqa who has been abused by ISIS — they have as much right to live as anyone else. I think the United States, in keeping with our values, needs to do everything possible to protect that person’s life, and not just take it because they happen to be in a war zone.” He picked up the straw, twisting it further in his hands. “How do you balance that?” he asked. “That’s where the agony comes in.” A few minutes before, he had written this off as subjective, a policy question. Now he didn’t seem so sure. “And that’s why this spectrum, a continuum about — what do you do in order to decimate as quickly as possible the terrorist forces, but at the same time try to protect the lives of that young Syrian boy or girl who is living in this environment of violence, who deserves a chance to live? How do you balance the equities? It’s tough! And throughout the course of the Obama administration, I felt really good that we had a president, and I was part of a team, that really valued protection of American life but also protection of innocent life. And I’m hoping that balance still prevails. But looking at some of the press reports, you know, I wonder if it does. I hope it does. I don’t know if it does.” What about Trump’s rhetoric? When the president says he wants to kill terrorists’ families, doesn’t that have an effect in the field? “Yeah,” he said. “And so you will have very strong, muscular U.S. action. And, it’s, you know, almost, you know — ‘Kill them all and let God sort them out.’ That — that’s wrong. America stands for something.” He talked about just-war theory, the proposition that war can be morally justified but that the standards for waging it must be high. “I have thought long and hard about the decision that this country made to drop nuclear weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Was that the right decision? I don’t know. Did it save a lot of American lives? Yeah, it probably did. Did it result in the deaths of more people than it saved, overall? It probably did. Because there’s no way that the untold people who were killed as a result of those strikes — U.S. forces never would have suffered those losses. And how do you value life? Is an American life worth so much more than others’ lives? No. I think all life is equal.” For a moment, the issue seemed to be settled. Then he seemed to hear the echo of his own words, which prompted him to add another line to the equation. “But! When you’re the president of the United States, or when you’re the assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism, your responsibility and obligation is to try to do what you can to protect American lives. But that doesn’t mean that you disregard a responsibility, a responsibility of just being a person, to not take others’ lives in a cavalier and an injudicious fashion. This is the struggle of war.” Brennan’s argument was suspended between his wish that all lives could be treated as equal and his inability to change a political calculus that dictated that they could not. A few days later, on May 1, the deadline arrived for Trump to issue his own report on civilian casualties, in keeping with Obama’s executive order. As president, Trump could easily have modified that part of the order, or replaced it with one of his own. Instead, the day came and went with no tally. (To date, none has been released.) Shortly after that, Brennan’s spokesman emailed what he said was a quote from Brennan in response to my questions on Warren Weinstein. It suggested that Brennan’s thinking was still evolving. “ ‘Near certainty’ means exactly that,” it read. “Tragically, innocents sometimes die, but rarely, at least that was the case during the Obama administration.” It went on: “War is hell, especially for those who are caught in the crossfire. And it is awful for those who had to make the tough decisions and who have to live with the results.” Mattathias Schwartz is a contributing writer for the magazine and a former staff writer at The New Yorker, where he won the Livingston Award for international reporting.

"Israel’s Fears, Amalek’s Arsenal","Advertisement By JEFFREY GOLDBERG MAY 16, 2009  WHEN the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, visits the White House on Monday for his first stage-setting visit, he will carry with him an agenda that clashes insistently with that of President Obama. Mr. Obama wants Mr. Netanyahu to endorse the creation of a Palestinian state. Mr. Netanyahu wants something else entirely: the president’s agreement that Iran must be prevented from acquiring nuclear weapons. Mr. Netanyahu, in his first term as prime minister in the late 1990s,  earned a reputation for conspicuous insincerity. It is therefore possible to interpret his fixation on Iran — he told me in a recent conversation that it is ruled by a “messianic apocalyptic cult” — as a way of avoiding the mare’s nest of problems associated with the Middle East peace process, especially the escalating pressure from the Obama administration to curb Jewish settlement on the West Bank. This reading of Mr. Netanyahu holds that he is, at bottom, a cynic (or, if you agree with him, a pragmatist), who will bluff vigorously but bend whenever he thinks it expedient or unavoidable. In his first term, he betrayed the principles of the Greater Israel movement by relinquishing part of Judaism’s second-holiest city, Hebron, to the control of Yasir Arafat. His pragmatism evinces itself, as well, in his apparent belief that the relationship between Israel and Washington is sacrosanct. In other words, Mr. Netanyahu, despite his rhetoric, would never launch a strike on Iran without the permission of Mr. Obama — permission that in no way appears forthcoming. But this is to misread both the prime minister and this moment in Jewish history. It is true that Mr. Netanyahu would prefer to avoid hard decisions concerning the Palestinian issue, for reasons both political (he is not, let us say, sympathetic to the cause of Palestinian self-determination) and strategic (he believes the Palestinians, divided and dysfunctional, their extremists firmly in the Iranian camp, are unready for compromise). Advertisement Nevertheless, the prime minister’s preoccupation with the Iranian nuclear program seems sincere and deeply felt. I recently asked one of his advisers to gauge for me the depth of Mr. Netanyahu’s anxiety about Iran. His answer: “Think Amalek.” Advertisement “Amalek,” in essence, is Hebrew for “existential threat.” Tradition holds that the Amalekites are the undying enemy of the Jews. They appear in Deuteronomy, attacking the rear columns of the Israelites on their escape from Egypt. The rabbis teach that successive generations of Jews have been forced to confront the Amalekites: Nebuchadnezzar, the Crusaders, Torquemada, Hitler and Stalin are all manifestations of Amalek’s malevolent spirit. If Iran’s nuclear program is, metaphorically, Amalek’s arsenal, then an Israeli prime minister is bound by Jewish history to seek its destruction, regardless of what his allies think. In our recent conversation, Mr. Netanyahu avoided metaphysics and biblical exegesis, but said that Iran’s desire for nuclear weapons represented a “hinge of history.” “Iran has threatened to annihilate a state,” he said. “In historical terms, this is an astounding thing. It’s a monumental outrage that goes effectively unchallenged in the court of public opinion. Sure, there are perfunctory condemnations, but there’s no j’accuse — there’s no shock.” He argued that one lesson of history is that “bad things tend to get worse if they’re not challenged early.” He went on, “Iranian leaders talk about Israel’s destruction or disappearance while simultaneously creating weapons to ensure its disappearance.” Mr. Netanyahu doesn’t believe that Iran would necessarily launch a nuclear-tipped missile at Tel Aviv. He argues instead that Iran could bring about the eventual end of Israel simply by possessing such weaponry. “Iran’s militant proxies would be able to fire rockets and engage in other terror activities while enjoying a nuclear umbrella,” he said. This could lead to the depopulation of the Negev and the Galilee, both of which have already endured sustained rocket attacks by Hamas and Hezbollah. More broadly, he said, a nuclear Iran “would embolden Islamic militants far and wide, on many continents, who would believe that this is a providential sign, that this fanaticism is on the ultimate road to triumph.” To understand why Mr. Netanyahu sees Iran as a new Amalek, it is essential to understand two aspects of his intellectual and emotional development: The scholarship of his father, and the martyrdom of his older brother. His father, Benzion Netanyahu, 99, is a pre-eminent historian of Spanish Jewry. “The Origins of the Inquisition in 15th-Century Spain,” his most notable book, toppled previously held understandings of the Inquisition’s birth. Advertisement Over more than 1,300 pages, Benzion Netanyahu argued that Spanish hatred of Jews was not merely theologically motivated but based in race hatred (the Spanish pursued the principle of limpieza de sangre, or the purity of blood) that reached back to the ancient world. The elder Netanyahu also argued that efforts by the Jews of Spain to accommodate their adversaries were futile, in part because the charges against them were devoid of logic or fact, and, perhaps most important, because the written or spoken expression of Jew hatred (his preferred term for anti-Semitism) inevitably led to physical persecution. “What emerges from our survey,” he wrote, “is that the Spanish Inquisition was by no means the result of a fortuitous concourse of circumstances and events. It was the product of a movement that called for its creation and labored for decades to bring it about.” A close reading of Benzion Netanyahu suggests a belief that anti-Semitism is a sui generis hatred, one that is shape-shifting, impervious to logic and eternal. The only rational response to such sentiment, in the Netanyahu view, is militant Jewish self-defense. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter. You must select a newsletter to subscribe to. Benjamin Netanyahu and his two brothers were raised in a home darkened by the history of the Inquisition, and they were taught Benzion’s understanding of the consequences of Jewish weakness. In his 1993 book, “A Place Among the Nations,” Benjamin Netanyahu wrote about what he saw as one of the miracles of the Zionist revolution: “The entire world is witnessing the historical transformation of the Jewish people from a condition of powerlessness to power, from a condition of being unable to meet the contingencies of a violent world to one in which the Jewish people is strong enough to pilot its own destiny.” If his father provided Mr. Netanyahu with his historical framework, his brother Yonatan bequeathed on him the model of a Jew who devoted his spirit to the cause of his people’s survival. Yonatan, who was killed while leading the 1976 raid on the Entebbe airport in Uganda  to free Israeli captives of Arab and German hijackers, is perhaps the most venerated figure in the post-Warsaw Ghetto Jewish martyrology, mainly because Entebbe still symbolizes the purest expression of the modern Jewish rejection of passivity. Friends and advisers say Benjamin Netanyahu took three lessons from his brother’s death: The first is that those who threaten Jews, and have the means to carry out their threats, should be neutralized pre-emptively. The second is that no one will defend the Jews except the Jews themselves. The third is that destiny has chosen the Netanyahus to expose and battle anti-Semitism — before it reaches the point of genocide. In his eulogy for Yonatan Netanyahu, Shimon Peres, then Israel’s defense minister, said: “There are times when the fate of an entire people rests on a handful of fighters and volunteers. They must secure the uprightness of our world in one short hour. In such moments, they have no one to ask, no one to turn to. The commanders on the spot determine the fate of the battle.” BENJAMIN Netanyahu faces the daunting task of maintaining Israel’s relationship with the United States, while at the same time forestalling Iran’s nuclear program. If Iran gains nuclear capacity, Israel will have judged him a failure as prime minister; if he does serious damage to his country’s standing in Washington, he will have failed as well. Mr. Netanyahu may be able to convince Mr. Obama that Iran poses an Amalek-sized threat to Israel, but he will have a much more difficult time convincing him that Iran poses an existential threat to America. It is certainly true that a nuclear Iran is not in the best interests of the United States. It would mean, among other things, the probable beginning of a nuclear arms race in the world’s most volatile region, and it would mean that the 30-year-struggle between America and Iran for domination of the Persian Gulf will be over, with Persia the victor. But the short-term costs, in particular, for an American strike — or an American-approved Israeli strike — could be appallingly high. Advertisement As the crisis worsens, Mr. Obama will find his options few, and those that exist will require him to bring to bear all his talents of persuasion. In his effort to engage Iran, he will need to promise a complete end to its international isolation in exchange for a halt to its nuclear program. But at the same time, he must be ready to threaten Iran with total estrangement from the West — the limiting of its gas imports, the choking-off of its banking system — if it continues its nuclear program. To do this, he must convince Europe, China and Russia that a nuclear Iran will be catastrophic for Middle East stability as well as for their own economies. If he’s unwilling to take military action against Iran, President Obama might soon enough be forced to design a containment strategy meant to scare a nuclear Iran into something resembling quiescence. Talk of containing Iran after it acquires a nuclear capacity, however, does not make the Israelis (or Iran’s Arab adversaries, for that matter) happy and, in fact, might push them closer to executing a military strike. The president, who has shown he understands the special dread Israelis feel about their precarious existence, surely knows this. Last year, during his campaign, he told me, “I know that that there are those who would argue that in some ways America has become a safe refuge for the Jewish people, but if you’ve gone through the Holocaust, then that does not offer the same sense of confidence and security as the idea that the Jewish people can take care of themselves no matter what happens.” Mr. Netanyahu says he supports Mr. Obama’s plan to engage the Iranians. He also supports the tightening of sanctions on the regime, if engagement doesn’t work. But there should be little doubt that, by the end of this year, if no progress is made, Mr. Netanyahu will seriously consider attacking Iran. His military advisers tell me they believe an attack, even an attack conducted without American help or permission, would have a reasonably high chance of setting back the Iranian program for two to five years. Around the world, this would be an extraordinarily unpopular step, but Mr. Netanyahu knows he would have much of the Israeli public behind him. Even the man who delivered the eulogy at his brother’s funeral, the far more dovish Shimon Peres, has assimilated the lessons Benzion taught his sons. When I visited recently with Mr. Peres, who is now Israel’s president, I asked him if there is a chance that his country has over-learned the lessons of Jewish history. He answered, “If we have to make a mistake of overreaction or underreaction, I think I prefer the overreaction.” Jeffrey Goldberg, a national correspondent for The Atlantic, is the author of “Prisoners: A Story of Friendship and Terror.” A version of this op-ed appears in print on , on Page WK14 of the New York edition with the headline: Israel’s Fears, Amalek’s Arsenal.

"China and EU strengthen promise to Paris deal with US poised to step away","Beijing and Brussels to set up new alliance to reduce global carbon emissions as Donald Trump says he will announce decision later on Thursday  Daniel Boffey and  Arthur Neslen in Brussels  Thu 1 Jun 2017 13.11 BST   First published on Wed 31 May 2017 18.31 BST   China and the EU will forge an alliance to take a leading role in tackling climate change in response to Donald Trump’s expected decision to pull the US out of the historic Paris agreement. Trump tweeted on Wednesday night that he would announce his decision at 3pm ET (8pm BST) on Thursday. There are fears that will he confirm reports that the US will soon join Nicaragua and Syria on the small list of countries refusing to back the climate accord , signed in 2015. I will be announcing my decision on Paris Accord, Thursday at 3:00 P.M. The White House Rose Garden. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! But Beijing and Brussels have been preparing to announce their intention to accelerate joint efforts to reduce global carbon emissions. According to a statement being prepared before an EU-China summit in Brussels on Thursday and Friday, the new alliance will say they are determined to “lead the energy transition” toward a low-carbon economy. The EU’s climate commissioner, Miguel Arias Cañete, told the Guardian: “The EU and China are joining forces to forge ahead on the implementation of the Paris agreement and accelerate the global transition to clean energy.” Cañete continued: “No one should be left behind, but the EU and China have decided to move forward. Our successful cooperation on issues like emissions trading and clean technologies are bearing fruit. Now is the time to further strengthen these ties to keep the wheels turning for ambitious global climate action.” In their declaration, Brussels and Beijing will also call on all parties “to uphold the Paris agreement” and signal their “highest political commitment” to doing so themselves. The document describes climate change as a “ national security issue” and “multiplying factor of social and political fragility” . The Paris pact is a “historic achievement” and “irreversible”, the document says. In a bid to calm jangling nerves in the developing world, the document reaffirms funding commitments and promises to bring forward new mid-century greenhouse gas reduction targets. The two blocs will also launch their first ever clean-energy cooperation, as well as measures on energy efficiency, low-emissions transport and low-carbon cooperation between cities. “The EU-China agreement on the full implementation on international commitments under the Paris agreement becomes even more important,” one EU source said. A senior EU official said there was a steely determination that the Paris agreement would not be allowed to unravel, having formally come into force last November. “This is not the end of the world,” she said. It's a climate change accord agreed by nearly 200 countries in December 2015, which came into force on 4 November 2016. The agreement commits world leaders to keeping global warming below 2C, seen as the threshold for safety by scientists, and pursuing a tougher target of 1.5C. The carbon emission curbs put forward by countries under Paris are not legally-binding but the framework of the accord, which includes a mechanism for periodically cranking those pledges up, is binding. The agreement also has a long-term goal for net zero emissions which would effectively phase out fossil fuels. It is hoped that the opposition for action on climate change in the White House will not be matched at the state level, where programmes are already in place and where there is a political will to defy the Washington line. The expected announcement in Brussels illustrates China’s determination to take a leadership role in the world as Trump turns the US inwards and prepares to shun its commitments under an international agreement Barack Obama had described as a “turning point for our planet” and a “major leap for mankind”. The joint EU-China statement will offer a high level of detail on how they intend to make real the promises they made when they agreed to limit global warming to well below 2C (3.6F). The EU, which has pioneered an emissions trading system, has agreed to provide China with €10m ($11.2m) to support its plan to roll out its own programme this year. Both sides will also promise to help developing countries reduce their carbon footprint, and the EU will increasingly share its technological knowhow. “Tackling climate change and reforming our energy systems are significant drivers of job creation, investment opportunities and economic growth,” the joint statement is expected to say. On Wednesday, reports emerged from Washington that Trump had, after months of prevarication, decided to remove the US from the agreement – despite pressure from world leaders at last weekend’s G7 summit. The speculation in the US was followed by a tweet from the president in which he said he would announce his decision “on the Paris accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” The expected decision from Trump – who once described climate change as a Chinese hoax – has appalled leaders in the EU and China, but there is a resolve to maintain the momentum behind the Paris agreement. EU sources said there was no evidence that any other countries would follow Washington’s lead. Finnish prime minister Juha Sipila reacted to the reports that Trump intended to withdraw from the Paris agreement by saying that climate change won’t be reversed “by closing your eyes” – and calling the expected withdrawal “a big setback”. In Denmark, the country’s climate minister, Lars Christian Lilleholt, said that “if true, this is a really, really bad signal from the United States.” On Thursday night in Brussels, the Chinese prime minister, Li Keqiang, will join the president of the European council, Donald Tusk, and European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker for an informal dinner before the main events the following day. A series of communiques and memorandums of understanding are expected to be released. The issues range from a need to increase free trade and ensure respect for global rules and norms, to dealing with non-competitive practices. The EU will also raise its continued concerns about human rights abuses in China, in particular in relation to new legislation on non-governmental organisations and the media. However it will be the joint climate change statement that will be the centrepiece of the summit. An EU official said: “The climate change discussions will be about how to promote the implementation of the deal in Paris. How to promote the use of clean energies. “This is a survival question for many Chinese cities and regions. And also for India. Europe has unprecedented knowhow in this field – technological knowhow, and also legal and regulatory knowhow to promote the use of such technologies. This is therefore a key area of cooperation between us.” Wendel Trio, the Director of Climate Action Network Europe said: “The summit shows that climate protection is and will remain top priority in the international cooperation, no matter what the US administration does. “The strengthened climate alliance between the EU and China should trigger more climate action. This will smooth the way for the two powers to ramp up their Paris climate pledges by 2020, when they are due to be resubmitted. Both are set to overachieve their targets and can afford to make an even bigger contribution.” Li Shuo, the climate policy adviser of Greenpeace East Asia, said it was crucial for the largest emitters of carbon to fill the vacuum left by the US’s likely decision. He said: “The rapid backlash of US climate action requires enhanced leadership from all other countries. At the upcoming EU-China summit, Beijing and Brussels need to demonstrate they are putting new and collective leadership into concrete terms. If US-China climate cooperation gave birth to the Paris agreement, now it is up to EU and China to defend and enhance it.”"
"The Foreign Policy Agenda","Advertisement NOV. 11, 2012  National security didn’t play heavily in the presidential election. But President Obama ’s legacy, and the country’s future, will be shaped as much by the foreign policy and defense decisions he makes over the next four years as by those on the domestic side. One of Mr. Obama’s singular contributions has been his vision of a world without nuclear weapons . It is a lofty goal that won’t be achieved in his second term, or maybe for years after that. But it offers a framework for reducing America’s stockpile and for arguing credibly that other countries should follow suit. In 2010, Mr. Obama won Senate ratification of a treaty with Russia that makes modest cuts in deployed long-range nuclear weapons. It is time to pursue further reductions in those deployed systems, and to seek cuts in warheads held in reserve and in short-range nuclear weapons, where Moscow has a big advantage. Nuclear arms are one area in which the ability of Washington and Moscow to work together is essential. If Mr. Obama can draw the other nuclear powers, including China , Pakistan , India and Israel , into the discussions and persuade the Senate to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, so much the better. The end of the campaign season might reduce the dangerous partisan posturing over Iran’s nuclear program . Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency are to resume talks next month, but any diplomatic solution will at some point require direct negotiations between Washington and Tehran. Meanwhile, international sanctions, which have seriously damaged Iran’s economy, need to be rigorously enforced and strengthened. Advertisement American military commanders are expected to recommend a timetable soon for withdrawing forces from Afghanistan . After a decade of American blood spilled there, President Obama should declare that the schedule will be dictated only by the security of the troops, and the withdrawal should take no more than a year. Advertisement Mr. Obama’s policies have severely weakened Al Qaeda , but extremism is growing in many regions, like North Africa and Pakistan. Dealing with that challenge will likely become harder, as will the choices Mr. Obama must make. For one thing, he will have to examine whether the expanding use of drones is the right approach. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter. You must select a newsletter to subscribe to. As for the Arab Spring countries, Mr. Obama has been wise to recognize that Washington cannot dictate their democratic evolutions. But he should be more engaged, offering more assistance to Islamic leaders who need to build their economies quickly while reminding them that American support will be calibrated based on their commitment to human rights and the rule of law. He should continue to resist calls for American military intervention in Syria , but he should search for ways to keep fortifying the opposition in that civil war, especially since the factions there now seem to be unifying. Many are pessimistic that anything can be done about an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal as long as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is in office and Palestinians are divided between Fatah and Hamas . It would be a mistake for Mr. Obama to cross this challenge off his list. He needs to keep seeking openings to promote the two-state solution. Mr. Obama is expected to use his second term to deepen engagement with Asia to protect American military interests and ensure American access to economic opportunities in that region. This could be a challenge given the coming change of leadership in Beijing . It is an inexhaustible list. Mr. Obama put major new or controversial initiatives on hold this year while the campaign was under way. Now he has two years before another election season impedes his ability to get things done. He needs to decide on his priorities and act while he has the political space and capital to do so.

"FTSE 100 hits record high as markets digest US-China tariff truce","Pound falls 0.4% against the dollar, boosting overseas earners in the UK’s leading index  Mon 21 May 2018 17.34 BST   Last modified on Mon 21 May 2018 23.50 BST   The FTSE 100 soared to a new record on Monday after news of a truce in the contentious trade dispute between the US and China cheered investors and helped send the pound lower against the dollar. News that the world’s two largest economies had backed away from a potentially disastrous trade war and agreed to abandon plans to raise tariffs on each other’s exports lifted the UK’s leading index to a peak of 7868.12, the first time it has climbed above 7800. This beats the previous high of 7792.56 set in the middle of January and is more than 14% above this year’s low of 6866 recorded towards the end of March when the UK expelled Russian diplomats after the Salisbury nerve agent attack. The index lost some of its gains as the day progressed but still ended at a new record close of 7859.17, up 80.38 points or 1.03% on the day. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: “Investors seemingly haven’t been put off by the general lack of specifics surrounding what was actually agreed between the US and China, crucial details like the extent to which America’s deficit with its rival will be reduced and how this new trading ‘framework’ will be implemented.” The UK market has been steadily rising over the past few days, with investors shrugging off concerns about the customs union and the Irish border. The previous record close came as recently as last Thursday, with the market helped by a weak pound and rising oil prices. The trade truce gave another boost to the dollar, removing for the moment at least the fears of the damage the dispute could do to the US and global economy. The pound fell 0.4% against the dollar to $1.3414, giving a lift to the large number of overseas earners in the FTSE 100 who benefit from a weaker sterling. Brent crude rose 0.42% to $78.84 a barrel after climbing above $80 last week, pushing the share prices of oil and commodity companies higher. Dave Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets said: “Supply concerns in light of President Trump’s decision to withdraw the US from the Iranian nuclear deal still persist. The relatively high price has encouraged others to keep production levels high.” Mergers and acquisitions have also played a part in boosting company valuations, with GKN and Ladbroke Coral already falling to predators this year and Sky , Sainsbury’s, SSE, packaging group Smurfit Kappa and Shire all involved in takeover situations. Russ Mould, investment director at asset management group AJ Bell also pointed out that investors buying shares in FTSE 100 companies could receive better than average returns. He said: “The FTSE 100 offers a dividend yield above 4%, according to an aggregate of consensus dividend forecasts for each individual constituent. This beats cash and the 1.49% yield offered by the benchmark 10-year government bond or gilt hands down. Such a yield could be a source of support for the index and chip in a healthy percentage of total returns from UK stocks in 2018.” Most European markets were also lifted by the trade talks truce. Germany’s Dax was closed for the Whitsuntide Monday holiday but France’s Cac finished 0.4% higher at 5637 and Europe’s Stoxx 600 added 0.35%. However Italy’s FTSE MIB fell 1.5% on continuing concerns about the policies of its new coalition government and possible tensions with the rest of the European Union. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 1.21% higher at 25,013. It was the first time the index had closed above 25,000 since March. But gold slipped back $2 to $1288 an ounce due to the rise in the dollar, and as investors shunned safe havens in favour of riskier assets."
"Ukraine: a local crisis with global repercussions","Mon 17 Mar 2014 13.43 GMT   First published on Mon 17 Mar 2014 13.43 GMT   If international relations are a seamless web, then the crisis over Russia's actions in Ukraine risks entangling other knotty current issues – from efforts to contain Iran's nuclear ambitions, through the continuing carnage in Syria to wider disarmament ambitions. For all the echoes of cold war days in the standoff over Crimea, its repercussions could affect some of the toughest problems of today's multipolar world, in which US power is perceived as being in retreat and Barack Obama has been criticised at home and abroad for a reluctance to use force and failure to act decisively. Given the current tensions, it seems highly likely that wider US-Russian co-operation will become harder. That matters: without agreement between Moscow and Washington, a deal would not have been possible after last year's Syrian chemical weapons crisis, which briefly threatened a dangerous escalation of the war. And Syria's agony is still far from over. Looking ahead, without Vladimir Putin's goodwill Obama may well find it far harder to manage the complex logistics of the long-awaited withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan . On another sensitive front, analysts have warned that Iran may feel emboldened by the confrontation between Russia and the US, because so much depends on their collaboration. "From the Iranian point of view," commented George Friedman of the Stratfor consultancy, "the US urgency to make peace [with Iran], along with Russia's interest in impeding Washington's progress, could temporarily boost Tehran's leverage in talks with Washington." Israel , which is concerned to maintain its own (undeclared) nuclear monopoly, and which is deeply suspicious of the western rapprochement with Tehran, appears worried. A Jerusalem Post correspondent warns: "Putin may strike back at western responses to his Ukrainian moves – such as trade sanctions and kicking Russia out of the G8 – by actively undermining US and western policy regarding Iran, or working against the current diplomatic process with the Palestinians." Russia, some US officials reportedly fear, may even move to torpedo a final deal on the Iranian nuclear dossier by striking its own bilateral energy agreement outside the negotiating framework of the P5 + 1 (the five permanent members of the UN security council, plus Germany). But Sadeq Zibakalam, of Tehran University, doubted the row between Russia and the west would benefit Iran because, he said, Moscow's position was weakening. Asian commentators have suggested that if the US and Europe allow Russia to take over Ukraine unchecked, North Korea and China are also likely to behave more aggressively in future. The crisis looks like good news for Syria's president, Bashar al-Assad . It will surely lessen the already slim prospects of pressure from Moscow – his most important international supporter – to make any significant concessions to the rebels fighting to overthrow him. Putin's insistence that Russian forces in Crimea are in fact Ukrainian "volunteers" echoes the crude propaganda of the Syrian war. And hopes that the Geneva II talks would map an exit strategy to end the conflict had, in any case, faded before Ukraine blew up. It seems a long time since the famous "reset" of US-Russian relations early in Obama's first term. Progress then included the "new start" treaty to reduce nuclear weapons, and Russia's membership of the World Trade Organisation. The White House also hoped for enhanced co-operation with the Kremlin over North Korea, Afghanistan, trade, and military-to-military engagement. Arms control experts warn now that the outcome of the Ukraine standoff will have an impact on nuclear nonproliferation. International security assurances were central to persuading Kiev to agree to get rid of its nuclear arsenal in 1994, under the terms of that year's Budapest Memorandum. Moscow, it is worth recalling, pledged then "to respect the independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of Ukraine", and "to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine". If Washington and London fail to stand by that commitment now, it would clearly discredit the idea of such assurances. However, or whenever, this crisis ends, the ripple effect will be felt far beyond Ukraine's borders. • Supporters say Trident fleet needed as new cold war threatens • Critics say nuclear posture "illogical and paranoid" • Opportunity presented by next week's nuclear summit"
"The Rage of 2016","Advertisement Supported by By  Roger Cohen NEW YORK — The long wave unfurled at last. Perhaps it is no surprise that the two societies that felt its furious force — the United States and Britain — are also the open societies at the hub of globalized turbo-capitalism and finance. For at least a decade, accelerating since the crash of 2008, fears and resentments had been building over the impunity of elites, the dizzying disruption of technology, the influx of migrants and the precariousness of modern existence. In Western societies, for too long, there had been no victories, no glory and diminishing certainties. Wars were waged; nobody knew how they could be won. Their wounds festered. The distance between metropolis and periphery grew into a cultural chasm. Many things became unsayable; even gender became debatable. Truth blurred, then was sidelined, in an online tribal cacophony. Jobs went. Inequality thrust itself in your face. What the powerful said and the lives people lived were so unrelated that politics looked increasingly like a big heist. Debacle followed debacle — the euro, the Iraq War, the Great Recession — and their architects never paid. Syria encapsulated the West’s newfound impotence, a kind of seeping amorality; and, in its bloody dismemberment, Syria sent into Europe a human tide that rabble-rousers seized upon. And so the British voted to quit the European Union, symbol of a continent’s triumph over fascism and destructive nationalism. Americans voted on Nov. 8 for Donald J. Trump, who used much of the xenophobic, fear-mongering language of 1930s Europe to assemble an angry mob large enough that he triumphed over a compromised Hillary Clinton. Neither victory was large, but democracies can usher in radical change by the narrowest of margins. To give the Republican president-elect his due, he intuited an immense disquiet and spoke to it in unambiguous language. A quarter-century after the post-Cold War zenith of liberal democracies and neoliberal economics, illiberalism and authoritarianism are on the march. It’s open season for anyone’s inner bigot. Violence is in the air, awaiting a spark. The winning political card today, as Mr. Trump has shown and Marine Le Pen may demonstrate in the French presidential election next year, is to lead “the people” against a “rigged system,” Muslim migration and the tyrannical consensus of overpaid experts. The postwar order — its military alliances, trade pacts, political integration and legal framework — feels flimsy, and the nature of the American power undergirding it all is suddenly unclear. Nobody excites Mr. Trump as much as Russia’s Vladimir V. Putin, who is to democracy what a sledgehammer is to a Ming vase. Strongmen and autocrats everywhere — not least in Egypt and the Gulf states — are exulting at Mr. Trump’s victory. It is too early to say what Mr. Trump will do and how many of his wild campaign promises he will keep, but it’s safe to predict turbulence. Irascibility, impetuosity and inattention define him, however curtailed they may prove to be by his entourage and the responsibilities of power. He is, for now, in over his head. NATO will grow weaker. Baltic States will feel more vulnerable. Syria’s Bashar al-Assad, backed by a Putin-Trump entente, will grow stronger. Chinese-American trade tensions will sharpen, in approximate sync with military tensions in the East and South China seas. The Iran nuclear deal, painstakingly negotiated by the major powers, could unravel, making the Middle East exponentially more dangerous. Any jihadi attack or other assault on America will not be met with restraint; Mr. Trump seems to regard nukes as an underused asset. Fossil fuels will make a comeback. The world’s Paris-enshrined commitment to fight climate change will be undermined. The approximately 65 million migrants on the move, about one-third of them refugees, will find shelter and dignity scarce as xenophobic nationalism moves into the political mainstream across Central Europe and elsewhere. Technology’s implacable advance, and the great strides being made by artificial intelligence, will test Mr. Trump’s promise to bring manufacturing jobs back to America. Some forms of employment are gone forever, and not even a self-styled savior can conjure their return. The Trans-Pacific Partnership already looks dead; other trade deals, including the North American Free Trade Agreement, which symbolized the ever-more-open trading system of past decades, could be nixed or substantially diluted. Will all this assuage the people’s ire? Perhaps Mr. Trump really does have some fairy dust he can scatter for a while. But of course “the people” were only part of a divided population, millions and millions of whom did not want — and will resist — the global nationalist and authoritarian lurch. They will do so on the streets, in the courts, via the press and through the checks and balances the framers of the Constitution created precisely to rein in a demagogue. Still, Mr. Trump has enormous powers, a Republican-controlled Congress and a mission to make America great again, whatever that means or takes. The struggle to preserve liberalism will be long. It may well be led now by the likes of Angela Merkel in Germany and Justin Trudeau in Canada. The mantle of custodian of the well-being of the free world sounds like a rip-off to Mr. Trump, who thinks deals and little else. It could well be that America has passed the torch. Western democracies are in the midst of an upheaval they only dimly grasp. Virtual direct democracy through social media has outflanked representative democracy. The impact of the smartphone on the human psyche is as yet scarcely understood; its addictiveness is treacherous and can be the enemy of thought. Mr. Trump hijacked the Republican Party like a man borrowing a dinner jacket for an evening. His campaign moved through Twitter to the aroused masses; it had no use or need for conventional channels. The major political parties in Britain and the United States will have to prove their relevance again. Democracies, it is clear, have not been delivering to the less privileged, who were disenfranchised or discarded in the swirl of technology’s advance. A lot of thought is now needed to find ways to restore faith in liberal, free-market societies; to show that they can be fairer and more equitable and offer more opportunities across the social spectrum. Germany, with its successful balance of capitalism and solidarity, its respect for the labor force and its commitments to both higher education and technical training, offers one model. The rage of 2016 will not abate by itself. The liberal elites’ arrogance and ignorance has been astounding. It is time to listen to the people who voted for change, be humble and think again. That, of course, does not mean succumbing to the hatemongers and racists among them: They must be fought every inch of the way. Nor does it mean succumbing to a post-truth society: Facts are the linchpins of progress. But so brutal a comeuppance cannot be met by more of the same.

"Transcript of the 2016 Debate Between the Running Mates","Advertisement Supported by QUIJANO: Good evening. From Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia, and welcome to the first, and only, vice presidential debate of 2016, sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. QUIJANO: I’m Elaine Quijano, anchor at CBSN, and correspondent for CBS News. It’s an honor to moderate this debate between Senator Tim Kaine and Governor Mike Pence. Both are longtime public servants who are also proud fathers of sons serving in the U.S. Marines. The campaigns have agreed to the rules of this 90-minute debate. There will be nine different segments covering domestic and foreign policy issues. Each segment will begin with a question to both candidates who will each have two minutes to answer. Then I’ll ask follow-up questions to facilitate a discussion between the candidates. By coin toss, it’s been determined that Senator Kaine will be first to answer the opening question. QUIJANO: We have an enthusiastic audience tonight. They’ve agreed to only express that enthusiasm once at the end of the debate and right now as we welcome Governor Mike Pence and Senator Tim Kaine. (APPLAUSE) Gentlemen, welcome. It truly is a privilege to be with both of you tonight. QUIJANO: I’d like to start with the topic of presidential leadership. Twenty-eight years ago tomorrow night, Lloyd Bentsen said the vice presidential debate was not about the qualifications for the vice presidency, but about how if tragedy should occur, the vice president has to step in without any margin for error, without time for preparation, to take over the responsibility for the biggest job in the world. What about your qualities, your skills, and your temperament equip you to step into that role at a moment’s notice? Senator Kaine? KAINE: Elaine, thank you for being here tonight, and, Governor Pence, welcome. It is so great to be back at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia. This is a very special place. Sixty-five years ago, a young, courageous woman, Barbara Johns, led a walkout of her high school, Moton High School. She made history by protesting school segregation. She believed our nation was stronger together. And that walkout led to the Brown v. Board of Education decision that moved us down the path toward equality. I am so proud to be running with another strong, history-making woman, Hillary Clinton, to be president of the United States. I’m proud because her vision of stronger together, building an economy that works for all, not just those at the top, being safe in the world not only with a strong military, but also strong alliances to battle terrorism and climate change, and also to build a community of respect, just like Barbara Johns tried to do 65 years ago. That’s why I’m so proud to be her running mate. Hillary told me why she asked me to be her running mate. She said the test of a Clinton administration will not be the signing of a bill or the passage of a bill. It’ll be whether we can make somebody’s life better, whether we can make a classroom better learning environment for schoolkids or teachers, whether we can make a safer — it’s going to be about results. And she said to me, you’ve been a missionary and a civil rights lawyer. You’ve been a city councilman and mayor. You’ve been a lieutenant governor and governor and now a U.S. senator. I think you will help me figure out how to govern this nation so that we always keep in mind that the success of the administration is the difference we make in people’s lives. And that’s what I bring to the ticket, that experience having served at all levels of government. But my primary role is to be Hillary Clinton’s right-hand person and strong supporter as she puts together the most historic administration possible. And I relish that role. I’m so proud of her. KAINE: I’ll just say this: We trust Hillary Clinton, my wife and I, and we trust her with the most important thing in our life. We have a son deployed overseas in the Marine Corps right now. We trust Hillary Clinton as president and commander-in-chief, but the thought of Donald Trump as commander-in-chief scares us to death. QUIJANO: Governor Pence? PENCE: Well, first off, thank you, Elaine, and thank you to — thank you to Norwood University for their wonderful hospitality and the Commission on Presidential Debates. It’s deeply humbling for me to be here, to be surrounded by my — my wonderful family. And, Senator Kaine, it’s an honor to be here with you, as well. And I just — I also want to say — I want to say thanks to everyone that’s looking in tonight, who understands what an enormously important time this is in the life of our nation. For the last seven-and-a-half years, we’ve seen America’s place in the world weakened. We’ve seen an economy stifled by more taxes, more regulation, a war on coal, and a failing health care reform come to be known as Obamacare, and the American people know that we need to make a change. And so I want to thank all of you for being — being with us tonight. PENCE: I also want to thank Donald Trump for making that call and inviting us to be a part of this ticket. I have to tell you, I’m a — I’m a small-town boy from a place not too different from Farmville. I grew up with a cornfield in my backyard. My grandfather had immigrated to this country when he was about my son’s age. My mom and dad built a — everything that matters in a small town in Southern Indiana. They built a family and — and a good name and a business. And they raised a family. And I dreamed some day of representing my home town in Washington, D.C., but I — honestly, Elaine, I never imagined — never imagined I’d have the opportunity to be governor of the state that I love, let alone be sitting at a table like this in this kind of a position. So to answer your question, I would say I — I would hope that if — if the responsibility ever fell to me in this role, that I would meet it with the way that I’m going to meet the responsibility should I be elected vice president of the United States. And that’s to bring a lifetime of experience, a lifetime growing up in a small town, a lifetime where I’ve served in the Congress of the United States, where — where I’ve led a state that works in the great state of Indiana, and whatever other responsibilities might follow from this, I — I would hope and, frankly, I would pray to be able to meet that moment with that — that lifetime of experience. QUIJANO: Senator Kaine, on the campaign trail, you praised Secretary Clinton’s character, including her commitment to public service, yet 60 percent of voters don’t think she’s trustworthy. Why do so many people distrust her? Is it because they have questions about her e-mails and the Clinton Foundation? KAINE: Elaine, let me tell you why I trust Hillary Clinton. Here’s what people should look at as they look at a public servant. Do they have a passion in their life that showed up before they were in public life? And have they held onto that passion throughout their life, regardless of whether they were in office or not, succeeding or failing? Hillary Clinton has that passion. From a time as a kid in a Methodist youth group in the suburbs of Chicago, she has been focused on serving others with a special focus on empowering families and kids. As a civil rights lawyer in the South, with the Children’s Defense Fund, first lady of Arkansas and this country, senator, secretary of state, it’s always been about putting others first. And that’s a sharp contrast with Donald Trump. Donald Trump always puts himself first. He built a business career, in the words of one of his own campaign staffers, “off the backs of the little guy.” And as a candidate, he started his campaign with a speech where he called Mexicans rapists and criminals, and he has pursued the discredited and really outrageous lie that President Obama wasn’t born in the United States. It is so painful to suggest that we go back to think about these days where an African-American could not be a citizen of the United States. And I can’t imagine how Governor Pence can defend the insult- driven selfish “me first” style of Donald Trump. QUIJANO: Governor Pence, let me ask you, you have said Donald Trump is, quote, “thoughtful, compassionate, and steady.” Yet 67 percent of voters feel he is a risky choice, and 65 percent feel he does not have the right kind of temperament to be president. Why do so many Americans think Mr. Trump is simply too erratic? PENCE: Well, let me — let me say first and foremost that, Senator, you and Hillary Clinton would know a lot about an insult- driven campaign. It really is remarkable. At a time when literally, in the wake of Hillary Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state, where she was the architect of the Obama administration’s foreign policy, we see entire portions of the world, particularly the wider Middle East, literally spinning out of control. I mean, the situation we’re watching hour by hour in Syria today is the result of the failed foreign policy and the weak foreign policy that Hillary Clinton helped lead in this administration and create. The newly emboldened — the aggression of Russia, whether it was in Ukraine or now they’re heavy-handed approach... KAINE: You guys love Russia. You both have said... PENCE: ... their heavy-handed approach. KAINE: You both have said — you both have said Vladimir Putin is a better leader than the president. PENCE: Well... (CROSSTALK) QUIJANO: Well, we’re going to get to Russia in just a moment. But I do want to get back to the question at... PENCE: But in the midst — Elaine, thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Senator, I’ll... KAINE: These guys have praised Vladimir Putin as a great leader. How can that... (CROSSTALK) QUIJANO: Yes, and we will get to that, Senator. We do have that coming up here. But in the meantime, the questions... PENCE: Well, Senator, I must have hit a... (CROSSTALK) PENCE: I must have hit a nerve here. QUIJANO: Why the disconnect? PENCE: Because at a time of great challenge in the life of this nation, where we’ve weakened America’s place in the world, stifled America’s economy, the campaign of Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine has been an avalanche of insults. Look, to get to your question about trustworthiness, Donald Trump has built a business through hard times and through good times. He’s brought an extraordinary business acumen. He’s employed tens of thousands of people in this country. KAINE: And paid few taxes and lost a billion a year. (CROSSTALK) QUIJANO : And why the disconnect with your running mate? PENCE: But there’s a — there’s a reason why people question the trustworthiness of Hillary Clinton. And that’s because they’re paying attention. I mean, the reality is, when she was secretary of state, Senator, come on. She had a Clinton Foundation accepting contributions from foreign governments. KAINE: You are Donald Trump’s apprentice. Let me talk about this... (CROSSTALK) PENCE: Senator, I think I’m still on my time. KAINE: Well, I think — isn’t this a discussion? QUIJANO: This is our open discussion. KAINE: Yeah, let’s talk about the state of... (CROSSTALK) PENCE: Well, let me interrupt — let me interrupt you and finish my sentence, if I can. KAINE: Finish your sentence. PENCE: The Clinton Foundation accepted foreign contributions from foreign governments and foreign donors while she was secretary of state. KAINE: OK, now I can weigh in. Now... PENCE: She had a private server... KAINE: Now, I get to weigh in. Now, let me just say this... PENCE: ... that was discovered... (CROSSTALK) QUIJANO: ... Senator, you have an opportunity to respond. PENCE: ... keep that pay to play process out of the reach of the public. KAINE: Governor Pence — Governor Pence doesn’t think the world’s going so well and he, you know, is going to say it’s everybody’s fault. PENCE: Do you? KAINE: Let me tell you this. When Hillary Clinton became secretary of state, Governor Pence, did you know that Osama bin Laden was alive? PENCE: Yes. KAINE: Do you know that we had 175,000 troops deployed in the battlefield in Iraq and Afghanistan? Do you know that Iran was racing toward a nuclear weapon and Russia was expanding its stockpile? Under Secretary Clinton’s leadership, she was part of the national team, public safety team that went after and revived the dormant hunt against bin Laden and wiped him off the face of the Earth. She worked to deal with the Russians to reduce their chemical weapons stockpile. She worked a tough negotiation with nations around the world to eliminate the Iranian nuclear weapons program without firing a shot. PENCE: Eliminate the Iranian nuclear weapons program? KAINE: Absolutely, without firing a shot. And instead of 175,000 American troops deployed overseas, we now have 15,000. PENCE: Right and... KAINE: These are very, very good things. PENCE: And Iraq has been overrun by ISIS, because Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate... KAINE: Well, if you want to put more American troops in Iraq, you can propose that. PENCE: Hillary Clinton — Hillary Clinton — Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate a status of forces agreement... KAINE: No, that is incorrect. That’s incorrect. PENCE: And so we removed — we removed all of our... QUIJANO: Gentlemen, we’ll get to... (CROSSTALK) PENCE: ... troops from Iraq, and ISIS was able to be conjured up in that vacuum. KAINE: But I’d like to correct... PENCE: ... and overrun vast areas of Iraq. KAINE: Governor, President Bush said we would leave Iraq at the end of 2011. And, Elaine, Iraq didn’t want our troops to stay, and they wouldn’t give us the protection for our troops. And guess what? If a nation where our troops are serving does not want us to stay, we’re not going to stay without their protection. PENCE: It was a failure of the secretary of state... QUIJANO: We need to move on to the next topic, gentlemen. KAINE: If Governor Pence wants to put more troops back in Iraq, that’s... QUIJANO: There are a lot of people wondering in this country about the economy. Let’s turn to the issue of the economy. KAINE: OK. QUIJANO: According to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, neither of your economic plans will reduce the growing $19 trillion gross national debt. In fact, your plans would add even more to it. Both of you were governors who balanced state budgets. Are you concerned that adding more to the debt could be disastrous for the country. Governor Pence? PENCE: I think the fact that — that under this past administration was of which Hillary Clinton was a part, we’ve almost doubled the national debt is atrocious. I mean, I’m very proud of the fact that — I come from a state that works. The state of Indiana has balanced budgets. We cut taxes, we’ve made record investments in education and in infrastructure, and I still finish my term with $2 billion in the bank. That’s a little bit different than when Senator Kaine was governor here in Virginia. He actually — he actually tried to raise taxes by about $4 billion. He left his state about $2 billion in the hole. In the state of Indiana, we’ve cut unemployment in half; unemployment doubled when he was governor. PENCE: But I think he’s a very fitting running mate for Hillary Clinton, because in the wake of a season where American families are struggling in this economy under the weight of higher taxes and Obamacare and the war on coal and the stifling avalanche of regulation coming out of this administration, Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want more of the same. It really is remarkable that they actually are advocating a trillion dollars in tax increases, which I get that. You tried to raise taxes here in Virginia and were unsuccessful. But a trillion dollars in tax increases, more regulation, more of the same war on coal, and more of Obamacare that now even former President Bill Clinton calls Obamacare a crazy plan. But Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to build on Obamacare. They want to expand it into a single-payer program. And for all the world, Hillary Clinton just thinks Obamacare is a good start. Look, Donald Trump and I have a plan to get this economy moving again just the way that it worked in the 1980s, just the way it worked in the 1960s, and that is by lowering taxes across the board for working families, small businesses and family farms, ending the war on coal that is hurting jobs and hurting this economy even here in Virginia, repealing Obamacare lock, stock, and barrel, and repealing all of the executive orders that Barack Obama has signed that are stifling economic growth in this economy. We can get America moving again. Put on top of that the kind of trade deals that’ll put the American worker first, and you’ve got a prescription for real growth. And when you get the economy growing, Elaine, that’s when you can deal with the national debt. When we get back to 3.5 percent to 4 percent growth with Donald Trump’s plan will do, then we’re going to have the resources to meet our nation’s needs at home and abroad, and we’re going to have the ability to bring down the national debt. QUIJANO: Senator Kaine? KAINE: Elaine, on the economy, there’s a fundamental choice for the American electorate. Do you want a “you’re hired” president in Hillary Clinton or do you want a “you’re fired” president in Donald Trump? I think that’s not such a hard choice. Hillary and I have a plan that’s on the table that’s a “you’re hired” plan. Five components. First thing we do is we invest in manufacturing, infrastructure, and research in the clean energy jobs of tomorrow. Second thing is we invest in our workforce, from pre-K education to great teachers to debt-free college and tuition-free college for families that make less than $125,000 a year. Third, we promote fairness by raising the minimum wage, so you can’t work full-time and be under the poverty level, and by paying women equal pay for equal work. Fourth, we promote small business growth, just as we’ve done in Virginia, to make it easier to start and grow small businesses. Hillary and I each grew up in small-business families. My dad, who ran an iron working and welding shop, is here tonight. And, fifth, we have a tax plan that targets tax relief to middle- class individuals and small businesses and asks those at the very top who’ve benefited as we’ve come out of recession to pay more. KAINE: The Trump plan is a different plan. It’s a “you’re fired” plan. And there’s two key elements to it. First, Donald Trump said wages are too high. And both Donald Trump and Mike Pence think we ought to eliminate the federal minimum wage. Mike Pence, when he was in Congress, voted against raising the minimum wage above $5.15. And he has been a one-man bulwark against minimum wage increases in Indiana. The second component of the plan is massive tax breaks for the very top, trillions of dollars of tax breaks for people just like Donald Trump. The problem with this, Elaine, is that’s exactly what we did 10 years ago and it put the economy into the deepest recession — the deepest recession since the 1930s. Independent analysts say the Clinton plan would grow the economy by 10.5 million jobs. The Trump plan would cost 3.5 million jobs. And Donald Trump — why would he do this? Because his tax plan basically helps him. And if he ever met his promise and he gave his tax returns to the American public like he said he would, we would see just how much his economic plan is really a Trump-first plan. QUIJANO: On that point, Governor Pence, recently the New York Times released part of Mr. Trump’s 1995 tax return and reported that he could have avoided paying federal income taxes for years. Yesterday, Mr. Trump said he brilliantly used the laws to pay as little tax as legally possible. Does that seem fair to you? PENCE: Well, first, let me say, I appreciated the “you’re hired,” “you’re fired” thing, Senator. You use that a whole lot. And I think your running mate used a lot of pre-done lines. Look, what — what you all just heard out there is more taxes, $2 trillion in more spending, more deficits, more debt, more government. And if you think that’s all working, then you look at the other side of the table. I mean, the truth of the matter is, the policies of this administration, which Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine want to continue, have run this economy into a ditch. We’re in the... KAINE: Fifteen million new jobs? PENCE: ... slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression. KAINE: Fifteen million new jobs? QUIJANO: Governor... (CROSSTALK) PENCE: There are millions more people living in poverty today than the day that Barack Obama with Hillary Clinton at his side... KAINE: And the poverty level and the median income... PENCE: ... stepped into the Oval Office. KAINE: ... improved dramatically between 2014 and 2015. PENCE: You — honestly, Senator, you can roll out the numbers and the sunny side, but I got to tell you, people in Scranton know different. People in Fort Wayne, Indiana, know different. I mean, this economy is struggling. The answer to this economy is not more taxes. KAINE: But it’s not the giveaway tax relief to the folks at the top. PENCE: It’s not more spending... (CROSSTALK) KAINE: I am interested to hear whether he’ll defend his running mate’s not releasing taxes and not paying taxes. PENCE: Absolutely I will. QUIJANO: Governor, with all due respect, the question was about whether it seems fair to you that Mr. Trump said he brilliantly used the laws to pay as little tax as legally possible. PENCE: Well, this is probably the difference between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine. And, I mean, Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine — God bless you for it, career public servants, that’s great — Donald Trump is a businessman, not a career politician. He actually built a business. Those tax returns that were — that came out publicly this week show that he faced some pretty tough times 20 years ago. But like virtually every other business, including the New York Times not too long ago, he used what’s called net operating loss. We have a tax code, Senator, that actually is designed to encourage entrepreneurship in this country. KAINE: But why won’t he release his tax returns? PENCE: Well, we’re answering the question about — about a business thing, is he... KAINE: I do want to come back to that, but... PENCE: His tax returns — his tax returns showed he went through a very difficult time, but he used the tax code just the way it’s supposed to be used. And he did it brilliantly. KAINE: How do you know that? You haven’t seen his tax returns. PENCE: He created a runway — because he’s created a business that’s worth billions of dollars today. KAINE: How do you know that? PENCE: And with regard to paying taxes, this whole riff about not paying taxes and people saying he didn’t pay taxes for years, Donald Trump has created tens of thousands of jobs. And he’s paid payroll taxes, sales taxes, property taxes... KAINE: Elaine, let me talk about something. QUIJANO: Senator, I’m going to give you about 30 seconds to respond, and I have question on Social Security for you. KAINE: OK. PENCE: The only issue on taxes — Hillary Clinton is going to raise taxes, and Donald Trump and I are going to cut them. KAINE: Donald Trump started this campaign in 2014 and he said, “If I run for president, I will absolutely release my taxes.” He’s broken his first... PENCE: And he will. KAINE: He’s broken his first promise. Second, he stood on the stage... PENCE: He hasn’t broken his promise. He said he’s... KAINE: He stood on the stage last week and when Hillary said, you haven’t been paying taxes, he said, “That makes me smart.” So it’s smart not to pay for our military? It’s smart not to pay for veterans? It’s smart not to pay for teachers? And I guess all of us who do pay for those things, I guess we’re stupid. And the last thing I’ll say is this... PENCE: Senator, do you take all the deductions that you’re entitled to? KAINE: The last thing — the last thing I want to ask Governor Pence is... PENCE: I do. KAINE: Governor Pence had to give Donald Trump his tax returns to show he was qualified to be vice president. Donald Trump must give the American public his tax returns to show that he’s qualified to be president. And he’s breaking his promise. PENCE: Elaine, I have to respond to this. QUIJANO: You get very little time, 20 seconds. PENCE: I’ll be — I’ll be very respectful. QUIJANO: Governor? PENCE: Look, Donald Trump has filed over 100 pages of financial disclosure, which is what the law requires. KAINE: But he said he would release his tax returns. QUIJANO: All right, Gentlemen... PENCE: The American people can review that. And he’s going — Senator, he’s going to release his tax returns when the audit is over... QUIJANO: ... I need to ask you about Social Security... KAINE: Richard Nixon released tax returns when he was under audit. PENCE: They’re going to raise your taxes. We’re going to cut your taxes. QUIJANO: Gentlemen... KAINE: If you can’t meet Nixon’s standard... QUIJANO: The people at home cannot understand either one of you when you speak over each other. I would please ask you to wait until it is that the other is finished. KAINE: All right. We’re having fun up here. QUIJANO: Senator Kaine, on the issue of Social Security, in 18 years, when the Social Security Trust Funds run out of money, you’ll be 76. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates your benefits could be cut by as much as $7,500 per year. What would your administration do to prevent this cut? KAINE: First, we’re going to protect Social Security, which is one of the greatest programs that the American government has ever done. It happened at a time when you would work your whole life, your whole life, raising your kids, working, being a Little League coach or a Sunday school teacher, and then you would retire into poverty. And Social Security has enabled people to retire with dignity and overwhelmingly not be in poverty. We have to keep it solvent. And we will keep it solvent. And we’ll look for strategies like adjusting the payroll tax cap upward in order to do that. Here’s what Hillary and I will not do. And I want to make this very plain. We will never, ever engage in a risky scheme to privatize Social Security. Donald Trump wrote a book and he said Social Security is a Ponzi scheme and privatization would be good for all of us. And when Congressman Pence was in Congress, he was the chief cheerleader for the privatization of Social Security. Even after President Bush stopped pushing for it, Congressman Pence kept pushing for it. We’re going to stand up against efforts to privatize Social Security. And we’ll look for ways to keep it solvent going forward, focusing primarily on the payroll tax cap. QUIJANO: Governor Pence, I’ll give you an opportunity to respond. PENCE: Well, thanks, Elaine. There they go again. OK... KAINE: Go read — go read the book. PENCE: All Donald Trump — all Donald Trump and I have said about Social Security is we’re going to meet our obligations to our seniors. That’s it. KAINE: Go read the book. PENCE: We’ve said we’re going to meet the obligations of Medicare. That’s what this campaign is really about, Senator. And I get, this is — this is the old scare tactic that they roll out... KAINE: But — but you have a voting record, Governor. PENCE: And I get all of that. I just, look... KAINE: I... PENCE: There’s a question that you asked a little bit earlier that I want to go back to. KAINE: I can’t believe that you won’t defend your own voting record. PENCE: I have to go back to. QUIJANO: We... PENCE: Well, look, I — you’re running with Hillary Clinton, who wants to raise taxes by $1 trillion, increase spending by $2 trillion, and you say you’re going to keep the promises of Social Security. Donald Trump and I are going to cut taxes. We’re going to — we’re going to — we’re going to... KAINE: You’re not going to cut taxes. You’re going to raise taxes on the middle class. PENCE: ... reform government programs so we can meet the obligations of Social Security and Medicare. QUIJANO: All right. PENCE: Stay on the path that your party has us on, we’re going to be in a — in a mountain range of debt. And we’re going to face hard choices and... (CROSSTALK) QUIJANO: Gentleman, I want to move on now. KAINE: You did ask this question about debt, and the debt explosion on the Trump plan is much, much bigger than anything on the Clinton side. Q UIJANO: All right. Let me move on now... PENCE: Three hundred and five (ph) economists said your plan is bad for the economy. QUIJANO: ... to the issue of law enforcement and race relations. Law enforcement and race relations. After the Dallas police shooting, Police Chief David Brown said, quote, “We’re asking cops to do too much in this country. Every societal failure we put it off on the cops to solve. Not enough mental health funding, not enough drug addiction funding, schools fail, let’s give it to the cops.” Do we ask too much of police officers in this country? And how would you specifically address the chief’s concerns? Senator Kaine? KAINE: Elaine, I think that’s a very fair comment. I think we put a lot on police shoulders. And this is something I got a lot of scar tissue and experience on. I was a city councilman and mayor in Richmond. And when I came in, we had one of the highest homicide rates in the United States. We fought very, very hard over the course of my time in local office with our police department, and we reduced our homicide rate nearly in half. And then when I was governor of Virginia, we worked hard, too. And we did something we had really wanted to do. For the first time ever, we cracked the top 10, 10 safest states, because we worked together. Here’s what I learned as a mayor and a governor. The way you make communities safer and the way you make police safer is through community policing. You build the bonds between the community and the police force, build bonds of understanding, and then when people feel comfortable in their communities, that gap between the police and the communities they serve narrows. And when that gap narrows, it’s safer for the communities and it’s safer for the police. That model still works across our country, but there are some other models that don’t work, an overly aggressive, more militarized model. Donald Trump recently said we need to do more stop-and-frisk around the country. That would be a big mistake because it polarizes the relationship between the police and the community. So here’s what we’ll do. We’ll focus on community policing. We will focus on — and Hillary Clinton has rolled out a really comprehensive mental health reform package that she worked on with law enforcement professionals, and we will also fight the scourge of gun violence in the United States. I’m a gun-owner. I’m a strong Second Amendment supporter. But I’ve got a lot of scar tissue, because when I was governor of Virginia, there was a horrible shooting at Virginia Tech, and we learned that through that painful situation that gaps in the background record check system should have been closed and it could have prevented that crime, and so we’re going to work to do things like close background record checks. And if we do, we won’t have the tragedies that we did. One of those killed at Virginia Tech was a guy named Liviu Librescu. He was a 70-plus-year-old Romanian Holocaust survivor. He had survived the Holocaust. Then he survived the Soviet Union takeover of his country. But then he was a visiting professor at Virginia Tech, and he couldn’t survive the scourge of gun violence. We can support the Second Amendment and do things like background record checks and make us safer, and that will make police safer, too. QUIJANO: Governor Pence? PENCE: You know, my uncle was a cop, a career cop, on the beat in downtown Chicago. He was my hero when I was growing up. And we’d go up to visit my dad’s family in Chicago. My three brothers and I would marvel at my uncle when he would come out in his uniform, sidearm at his side. Police officers are the best of us. And the men and women, white, African-American, Asian, Latino, Hispanic, they put their lives on the line every single day. And let my say, at the risk of agreeing with you, community policing is a great idea. It’s worked in the Hoosier state. And we fully support that. Donald Trump and I are going to make sure that law enforcement have the resources and the tools to be able to really restore law and order to the cities and communities in this nation. It’s probably — probably why the 330,000 members of the Fraternal Order of Police endorsed Donald Trump as the next president of the United States of America, because they see his commitment to them. They see his commitment to law and order. But they also — they also hear the bad mouthing, the bad mouthing that comes from people that seize upon tragedy in the wake of police action shootings as — as a reason to — to use a broad brush to accuse law enforcement of — of implicit bias or institutional racism. And that really has got to stop. I mean, when an African-American police officer in Charlotte named Brentley Vinson, an all-star football player who went to Liberty University here in the state, came home, followed his dad into law enforcement, joined the force in Charlotte, joined the force in Charlotte in 2014, was involved in a police action shooting that claimed the life of Keith — Keith Lamont Scott, it was a tragedy. I mean, I — we — we mourn with those who mourn. We — we grieve with those who grieve. And we’re saddened at the loss of life. But Hillary Clinton actually referred to that moment as an example of implicit bias in the police force, where — where she used — when she was asked in the debate a week ago whether there was implicit bias in law enforcement, her only answer was that there’s implicit bias in everyone in the United States. I just think... KAINE: Can I — can I explain... PENCE: ... I just think what we ought to do is we ought to stop seizing on these moments of tragedy. We ought to assure the public that we’ll have a full and complete and transparent investigation whenever there’s a loss of life because of police action. But, Senator, please, you know, enough of this seeking every opportunity to demean law enforcement broadly by making the accusation of implicit bias every time tragedy occurs. KAINE: Elaine — Elaine, people shouldn’t be afraid to bring up issues of bias in law enforcement. And if you’re afraid to have... PENCE: I’m not afraid to bring that up. KAINE: And if — if you’re afraid to have the discussion, you’ll never solve it. And so here’s — here’s an example, heartbreaking. We would agree this was a heartbreaking example. The guy, Philando Castile, who was killed in St. Paul, he was a worker, a valued worker in a local school. And he was killed for no apparent reason in an incident that will be discussed and will be investigated. But when folks went and explored this situation, what they found is that Philando Castile, who was a — they called him Mr. Rogers with Dreadlocks in the school that he worked. The kids loved him. But he had been stopped by police 40 or 50 times before that fatal incident. And if you look at sentencing in this country, African-Americans and Latinos get sentenced for the same crimes at very different rates. PENCE: We need criminal justice reform. KAINE: Well, we do. PENCE: Indiana has passed criminal justice reform. KAINE: But I just want to say, those who say that we should not... PENCE: But that’s not what you’re talking about. KAINE: ... we should not be able to bring up and talk about bias in the system, we’ll never solve the problem... QUIJANO: Governor Pence... (CROSSTALK) QUIJANO: Governor Pence... PENCE: Senator, when African-American police officers involved in a police action shooting involving an African-American, why would Hillary Clinton accuse that African-American police officer of implicit bias? KAINE: Well, I guess I can’t believe you are defending the position that there is no bias and it’s a topic we don’t even... (CROSSTALK) QUIJANO: Governor Pence, I have a question on that point. PENCE: I did not make that statement. I... QUIJANO: Your fellow Republican, Governor Pence, Senator Tim Scott, who is African-American, recently spoke on the Senate floor. He said he was stopped seven times by law enforcement in one year. KAINE: A U.S. senator. QUIJANO: He said, “I have felt the anger, the frustration, the sadness, and the humiliation that comes with feeling like you’re being targeted for nothing more than being just yourself.” What would you say to Senator Scott about his experiences? PENCE: Well, I have the deepest respect for Senator Scott, and he’s a close friend. And what I would say is that we — we need to adopt criminal justice reform nationally. I — I signed criminal justice reform in the state of Indiana, Senator, and we’re very proud of it. I worked when I was Congress on a second chance act. We have got to do a better job recognizing and correcting the errors in the system that do reflect on institutional bias in criminal justice. But what — what — what Donald Trump and I are saying is let’s not have the reflex of assuming the worst of men and women in law enforcement. We truly do believe that law enforcement is not a force for racism or division in our country... KAINE: Elaine, can I... QUIJANO: So what would you say to Senator Scott, Governor? PENCE: Law enforcement in this country is a force for good. They are the — they truly are people that put their lives on the line every single day. But I would — I would suggest to you, what we need to do is assert a stronger leadership at the national level to support law enforcement. You just heard Senator Kaine reject stop-and-frisk. Well, I would suggest to you that the families that live in our inner cities that are besieged by crime... KAINE: Elaine, let me — let me... QUIJANO: Governor, the question is about Senator Scott. What would — what would you tell Senator Scott? KAINE: Elaine, if I could — if I could jump in. I’ve heard Senator Scott make that eloquent plea. And look, criminal justice is about respecting the law and being respected by the law. So there is a fundamental respect issue here. And I just want to talk about the tone that’s set from the top. Donald Trump during his campaign has called Mexicans rapists and criminals. He’s called women slobs, pigs, dogs, disgusting. I don’t like saying that in front of my wife and my mother. He attacked an Indiana-born federal judge and said he was unqualified to hear a federal lawsuit because his parents were Mexican. He went after John McCain, a POW, and said he wasn’t hero because he’d been captured. He said African-Americans are living in Hell. And he perpetrated this outrageous and bigoted lie that President Obama is not a U.S. citizen. If you want to have a society where people are respected and respect laws, you can’t have somebody at the top who demeans every group that he talks about. And I just — again, I cannot believe that Governor Pence will defend the insult-driven campaign that Donald Trump has run. QUIJANO: All right. I want to turn to our next segment now, immigration. Your running mates have both said that undocumented immigrants who have committed violent crimes should be deported. What would you tell the millions of undocumented immigrants who have not committed violent crimes? Governor Pence? PENCE: Donald Trump’s laid out a plan to end illegal immigration once and for all in this country. We’ve been talking it to death for 20 years. Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to continue the policies of open borders, amnesty, catch and release, sanctuary cities, all the things that are driving — that are driving wages down in this country, Senator, and also too often with criminal aliens in the country, it’s bringing heartbreak. But I — Donald Trump has a plan that he laid out in Arizona, that will deal systemically with illegal immigration, beginning with border security, internal enforcement. It’s probably why for the first time in the history of Immigration and Customs Enforcement their union actually endorsed Donald Trump as the next president of the United States, because they know they need help to enforce the laws of this country. And Donald Trump has laid out a priority to remove criminal aliens, remove people that have overstayed their visas. And — and once we have accomplished all of that, which will — which will strengthen our economy, strengthen the rule of law in the country and make our communities safer once the criminal aliens are out, then we’ll deal with those that remain. But I have to tell you, I just — I was listening to the avalanche of insults coming out of Senator Kaine a minute ago. KAINE: These were Donald’s — hold on a second, Governor. (CROSSTALK) PENCE: It’s my time, Senator. QUIJANO: It is, in fact, the governor’s time. KAINE: I apologize. It’s your two minutes. I apologize. PENCE: Thanks. I forgive you. He says ours is an insult-driven campaign. Did you all just hear that? Ours is an insult-driven campaign? I mean, to be honest with you, if Donald Trump had said all of the things that you’ve said he said in the way you said he said them, he still wouldn’t have a fraction of the insults that Hillary Clinton leveled when she said that half of our supporters were a basket of deplorables. It’s — she said they were irredeemable, they were not American. I mean, it’s extraordinary. And then she labeled one after another “ism” on millions of Americans who believe that we can have a stronger America at home and abroad, who believe we can get this economy moving again, who believe that we can end illegal immigration once and for all. So, Senator, this — this insult-driven campaign, I mean... QUIJANO: Governor... PENCE: That’s small potatoes compared to Hillary Clinton... QUIJANO: Senator Kaine? PENCE: .... calling half of Donald Trump’s supporters a basket of deplorables. KAINE: Hillary Clinton said something on the campaign trail, and the very next day, she said, you know what, I shouldn’t have said that. PENCE: She said she shouldn’t have said half. QUIJANO: Governor, this is Senator Kaine’s two minutes, please. KAINE: Yeah, that’s right, so now we’re even. PENCE: Yeah. (LAUGHTER) KAINE: Look for Donald trump apologizing to John McCain for saying he wasn’t a hero... PENCE: Oh... KAINE: ... to Donald Trump apologizing for calling women slobs, pigs, dogs, disgusting. PENCE: She apologized for saying “half.” QUIJANO: Governor. It is his two minutes, please. KAINE: Did Donald Trump apologize for taking after somebody in a Twitter war and making fun of her weight? Did he apologize for saying African-Americans are living in Hell? Did he apologize for saying President Obama was not even a citizen of the United States? You will look in vain to see Donald Trump ever taking responsibility for anybody and apologizing. Immigration. There’s two plans on the table. Hillary and I believe in comprehensive immigration reform. Donald Trump believes in deportation nation. You’ve got to pick your choice. Hillary and I want a bipartisan reform that will put keeping families together as the top goal, second, that will help focus enforcement efforts on those who are violent, third, that will do more border control, and, fourth, that will provide a path to citizenship for those who work hard, pay taxes, play by the rules, and take criminal background record checks. That’s our proposal. Donald Trump proposes to deport 16 million people, 11 million who are here without documents. And both Donald Trump and Mike Pence want to get rid of birthright citizenship. So if you’re born here, but your parents don’t have documents, they want to eliminate that. That’s another 4.5 million people. These guys — and Donald Trump have said it — deportation force. They want to go house to house, school to school, business to business, and kick out 16 million people. And I cannot believe... PENCE: That’s nonsense. That’s nonsense. KAINE: I cannot believe that Governor Pence would sit here and defend his running mate’s claim that we should create a deportation force to — so that they’ll all be gone. PENCE: Senator, we have a deportation force. It’s called Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. And the union for Immigrations and Customs Enforcement for the first time in their history endorsed Donald Trump to be the next president of the United States of America. KAINE: So you like the 16 million deportations? PENCE: Senator, that’s — that’s nonsense. Look, what you just heard is they have a plan for open borders, amnesty. That’s... (CROSSTALK) KAINE: Our plan is like Ronald Reagan’s plan from 1986. PENCE: They call it comprehensive immigration reform — they call it comprehensive immigration reform on Capitol Hill. We all know the routine. It’s amnesty. And you heard one of the last things he mentioned was border security. PENCE: That’s how Washington always plays it. KAINE: No, I... PENCE: They always say we’re going to do this, we’re going to do that, we’ll eventually get the border... (CROSSTALK) KAINE: ... border security three years ago, and Governor Pence was against it. QUIJANO: Governor, Mr. Trump has said... PENCE: Ronald Reagan said a nation without borders is not a nation. Donald Trump is committed to restoring the borders of this nation and securing our nation, enforcing our laws. QUIJANO: So, Governor, how would these millions of undocumented immigrants leave? Would they be forcibly removed? PENCE: Well, I think Donald Trump laid out a series of priorities that doesn’t ends with border security. It begins with border security. And after we secure the border, not only build a wall, but beneath the ground and in the air, we do internal enforcement. But he said the focus has to be on criminal aliens. We just — we just had a conversation about law enforcement. We just had a conversation about the — the violence that’s besetting our cities. The reality is that there’s heartbreak and tragedy that has struck American families because people that came into this country illegally are now involved in criminal enterprise and activity. And we don’t have the resources or the will to deport them systemically. Donald Trump has said we’re going to move those people out, people who’ve overstayed their visas. We’re going to enforce the law of this country. We’re going to strengthen Immigrations and Customs Enforcements with more resources and more personnel to be able to do that. And then Donald Trump has made it clear, once we’ve done all of those things, that we’re going to reform the immigration system that we have... KAINE: I just have to correct Governor Pence.... PENCE: ... where people can come into this country. KAINE: I have to... PENCE: That’s the order that you should do it. Border security, removing criminal aliens, upholding with law, and then — but then, Senator, I’ll work you when you go back to the Senate, I promise you, we’ll work you to reform the immigration system. KAINE: I look forward to working together in whatever capacities we serve in. But I just want to make it very, very clear that he’s trying to fuzz up what Donald Trump has said. When Donald Trump spoke in Phoenix, he looked the audience in the eye and he said, no, we’re building a wall, and we’re deporting everybody. He said, quote, “They will all be gone.” “They will all be gone.” And this is one of these ones where you can just go to the tape on it and see what Donald Trump has said. And to add... PENCE: He’s talking about criminal aliens. KAINE: And to add to it, and to add to it, and to add to it, we are a nation of immigrants. Mike Pence and I both are descended from immigrant families. Some things, you know, maybe weren’t said so great about the Irish when they came, but we’ve done well by absorbing immigrants, and it’s made our nation stronger. When Donald Trump says Mexicans are rapists and criminals, Mexican immigrants, when Donald Trump says about your judge, a Hoosier judge, he said that Judge Curiel was unqualified to hear a case because his parents were Mexican, I can’t imagine how you could defend that. QUIJANO: Gentleman, I’d like to shift now to the threat of terrorism. Do you think the world today is a safer or more dangerous place than it was eight years ago? Has the terrorist threat increased or decreased? Senator Kaine? KAINE: The terrorist threat has decreased in some ways, because bin Laden is dead. The terrorist threat has decreased in some ways because an Iranian nuclear weapons program has been stopped. The terrorist threat to United States troops has been decreased in some ways because there’s not 175,000 in a dangerous part of the world. There’s only 15,000. But there are other parts of the world that are challenging. Let me tell you this: To beat terrorism, there’s only one candidate who can do it, and it’s Hillary Clinton. Remember, Hillary Clinton was the senator from New York on 9/11. She was there at the World Trade Center when they were still searching for victims and survivors. That’s seared onto her, the need to beat terrorism. And she’s got a plan to do it. She was part of the national security team that wiped out bin Laden. Here’s her plan to defeat ISIL. First, we’ve got to keep taking out their leaders on the battlefield. She was part of the team that got bin Laden, and she’ll lead the team that will get Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the head of ISIS. Second, we’ve got to disrupt financing networks, third, disrupt their ability to recruit on the Internet, in their safe havens. But, fourth, we also have to work with allies to share and surge intelligence. That’s the Hillary Clinton plan; she’s got the experience to do it. Donald Trump. Donald Trump can’t start a Twitter war with Miss Universe without shooting himself in the foot. Donald Trump doesn’t have a plan. He said, “I have a secret plan,” and then he said, “Um, I know more than all the generals about ISIL.” And then he said, “I’m going to call the generals to help me figure out a plan.” And finally he said, “I’m going to fire all the generals.” He doesn’t have a plan. But he does have dangerous ideas. Here’s four. He trash talks the military. The military is a disaster, John McCain’s no hero, the generals need all to be fired, and I know more than them. He wants to tear up alliances. NATO is obsolete, and we’ll only work together with Israel if they pay “big league.” Third, he loves dictators. He’s got kind of a personal Mount Rushmore, Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong-un, Moammar Gadhafi... PENCE: Oh, please. Come on. KAINE: ... and Saddam Hussein. And last and most dangerously, Donald Trump believes — Donald Trump believes that the world will be safer if more nations have nuclear weapons. He’s said Saudi Arabia should get them, Japan should get them, Korea should get them. And when he was confronted with this, and told, wait a minute, terrorists could get those, proliferation could lead to nuclear war, here’s what Donald Trump said, and I quote: “Go ahead, folks, enjoy yourselves.” I’d love to hear Governor Pence tell me what’s so enjoyable or comical about nuclear war. QUIJANO: Governor Pence? PENCE: Did you work on that one a long time? Because that had a lot of really creative lines in it. KAINE: Well, I’m going to see if you can defend any of it. PENCE: Well, look, I can defend — I — I — I can — I can make very clear to the American people, after traveling millions of miles as our secretary of state, after being the architect of the foreign policy of this administration, America is less safe today than it was the day that Barack Obama became president of the United States. It’s absolutely inarguable. We’ve weakened America’s place in the world. It’s been a combination of factors, but mostly it’s been a lack of leadership. I mean, I will give you — and I was in Washington, D.C., on 9/11. I saw the clouds of smoke rise from the Pentagon. KAINE: I was in Virginia where the Pentagon’s... (CROSSTALK) PENCE: I know you were. We all lived through that day as a nation. It was heartbreaking. And I want to give this president credit for bringing Osama bin Laden to justice. But the truth is, Osama bin Laden led Al Qaida. Our primary threat today is ISIS. And because Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate a status of forces agreement that would have allowed some American combat troops to remain in Iraq and secure the hard fought gains the American soldier had won by 2009, ISIS was able to be literally conjured up out of the desert, and it’s overrun vast areas that the American soldier had won in Operation Iraqi Freedom. My heart breaks for the likes of Lance Cpl. Scott Zubowski. He fell in Fallujah in 2005. He fought hard through some of the most difficult days in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and he paid the ultimate sacrifice to defend our freedom and secure that nation. And that nation was secured in 2009. But because Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama failed to provide a status of forces agreement and leave sufficient troops in there, we are back at war. The president just ordered more troops on the ground. We are back at war in Iraq. And Scott Zubowski, whose mom would always come to Memorial Day events in Newcastle, Indiana, to see me, and I’d give her a hug and tell her we’re never going to forget her son and we never will, Scott Zubowski and the sacrifices the American soldier made were squandered in Iraq because this administration created a vacuum in which ISIS was able to grow. And a reference to the Iranian deal, the Iranian deal that Hillary Clinton initiated, $150 billion to the radical mullahs in Iran. KAINE: Stopping a nuclear weapons program without firing a shot? PENCE: You didn’t stop the nuclear weapons program. KAINE: Yes, we did. PENCE: You essentially... KAINE: Even the Israeli military says it stopped. PENCE: ... guaranteed that Iran will someday become a nuclear power, because there’s no limitations once the period of time of the treaty comes off. QUIJANO: Governor Pence, Mr. Trump has proposed extreme vetting of immigrants from parts of the world that export terrorism. But that does not address many of the recent terrorist attacks in the United States, such as the Orlando nightclub massacre and the recent bombings in New York and New Jersey. Those were homegrown, committed by U.S. citizens and legal residents. What specific tools would you use to prevent those kinds of attacks? PENCE: Well, I think it’s — I think it’s a great question, Elaine, but it really does begin with us reforming our immigration system and putting the interests, particularly the safety and security of the American people, first. I mean, Donald Trump has called for extreme vetting for people coming into this country so that we don’t bring people into the United States who are hostile to our Bill of Rights freedoms, who are hostile to the American way life. But also, Donald Trump and I are committed to suspending the Syrian refugee program and programs and immigration from areas of the world that have been compromised by terrorism. Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to increase the Syrian refugee program by 500... (CROSSTALK) KAINE: Elaine, I want to... (CROSSTALK) QUIJANO: Governor, the question was about homegrown. PENCE: Yeah, and so — but first, you know, let’s make sure we’re putting the safety and security of the American people first instead of Hillary Clinton expanding the Syrian refugee program... KAINE: Or instead of you violating the Constitution by blocking people based on their national origin rather than whether they’re dangerous. PENCE: That’s not — that’s absolutely false. KAINE: That’s what the Seventh Circuit decided just — here’s the difference, Elaine. PENCE: The Seventh Circuit... KAINE: We have different views on — on refugee issues and on immigration. Hillary and I want to do enforcement based on, are people dangerous? These guys say all Mexicans are bad. PENCE: That’s absolutely false. KAINE: And with respect to refugees, we want to keep people out if they’re dangerous. Donald Trump said keep them out if they’re Muslim. Mike Pence... PENCE: Absolutely... KAINE: ... put a program in place to keep them out if they’re from Syria. And yesterday an appellate court with three Republican judges struck down the Pence plan... PENCE: Right. Right. KAINE: ... and said it was discriminatory... PENCE: And those judges — those judges said... KAINE: We should focus upon danger, not upon discrimination. QUIJANO: Governor? PENCE: Elaine, to your point, those judges said it was because there wasn’t any evidence yet that — that ISIS had infiltrated the United States. Well, Germany just arrested three Syrian refugees that were connected to ISIS. (CROSSTALK) KAINE: But they told you there’s a right way and a wrong way to do it. PENCE: But, look, if you’re going to be critical of me on that, that’s fair game. I will tell you, after two Syrian refugees were involved in the attack in Paris that is called Paris’ 9/11, as governor of the state of Indiana, I have no higher priority than the safety and security of the people of my state. KAINE: But, Governor Pence... PENCE: So you bet I suspended that program. KAINE: But, Governor Pence, I just... PENCE: And I stand by that decision. And if I’m vice president of the United States or Donald Trump is president, we’re going to put the safety and security of the American people first. KAINE: Sure. Can we just be clear — Hillary and I will do immigration enforcement and we’ll vet refugees based on whether they’re dangerous or not. We won’t do it based on discriminating against you from the country you come from or the religion that you practice. PENCE: But the problem with that... KAINE: That is completely antithetical to the Jeffersonian values of... (CROSSTALK) PENCE: Elaine, the director of the FBI, our homeland security, said we can’t know for certain who these people are coming from Syria. KAINE: Yes, we can, and when we don’t let them know, we don’t let them in. PENCE: So — the FBI... KAINE: When we don’t know who they are, we don’t let them in. PENCE: The FBI and homeland security said we can’t know for certain. You’ve got to err on the side of the safety and security of the American people, Senator. I understand the... KAINE: By trashing all Syrians or trashing all Muslims? PENCE: ... the U.N. wants us to expand the Syrian refugee program... QUIJANO: Senator Kaine, let me ask you this. Secretary Clinton... PENCE: We’re going to put the safety and security of the American people first. QUIJANO: ... has talked about an intelligence surge. KAINE: Yes. QUIJANO: What exactly would an intelligence surge look like? And how would that help identify terrorists with no operational connection to a foreign terrorist organization? KAINE: Intelligence surge is two-thirds, Elaine. It’s two things. It’s, first, dramatically expanding our intelligence capacities by hiring great professionals, but also we’ve got some of the best intel and cyber employees in the world right here in the United States working for many of our private sector companies. So it involves increasing our own workforce, but striking great partnerships with some of our cyber and intel experts in the private sector so that we can, consistent with constitutional principles, gather more intelligence. But the second piece of this is really, really important. It also means creating stronger alliances, because you gather intelligence and then you share your intelligence back and forth with allies. And that’s how you find out who may be trying to recruit, who may be trying to come to one country or the next. Alliances are critical. That’s why Donald Trump’s claim that he wants to — that NATO is obsolete and that we need to get rid of NATO is so dangerous. PENCE: That’s not his plan. KAINE: Well, he said NATO is obsolete. And, look, if you put aside — push aside your alliances, who you’re going to share intelligence with? Hillary Clinton is the secretary of state who knows how to build alliances. She built the sanctions regime around the word that stopped the Iranian nuclear weapons program. And that’s what an intelligence surge means. Better skill and capacity, but also better alliances. QUIJANO: All right. I’d like to turn now to the tragedy in Syria. Two hundred fifty thousand... PENCE: Can I speak about the cybersecurity surge at all? QUIJANO: You can — you can have 30 seconds, Governor, quickly, please. PENCE: First, Donald Trump just spoke about this issue this week. We have got to bring together the best resources of this country to understand that cyber warfare is the new warfare of the asymmetrical enemies that we face in this country. And I look forward if I’m privileged to be in this role of working with you in the Senate to make sure that we resource that effort. KAINE: We will work together in whatever roles we inhabit. PENCE: We have an intelligence, sir (ph). But I will also tell you that it’s important in this moment to remember that Hillary Clinton had a private server in her home that had classified information on it... QUIJANO: And I don’t — 30 seconds is on up. PENCE: ... about drone strikes, e-mails from the president of the United States of America were on there. QUIJANO: Right. PENCE: Her private server was subject to being hacked by foreign... (CROSSTALK) QUIJANO: I’d like to ask you about Syria, Governor. PENCE: We could put cybersecurity first if we just make sure the next secretary of state doesn’t have a private server. (CROSSTALK) KAINE: And all investigation concluded that not one reasonable prosecutor would take any additional step. You don’t get to decide the rights and wrongs of this. We have a justice system that does that. And a Republican FBI director did an investigation and concluded that... (CROSSTALK) QUIJANO: All right, we are moving on now. Two hundred fifty thousand people... PENCE: If your son or my son handled classified information the way Hillary Clinton did... QUIJANO: ... one hundred thousand of them children — Governor... PENCE: ... they’d be court martialed. KAINE: That is absolutely false and you know that. PENCE: Absolutely true. KAINE: And you know that, Governor. QUIJANO: Governor... PENCE: It’s absolutely true. QUIJANO: Gentlemen, please. KAINE: Because the FBI did an investigation. QUIJANO: Gentlemen. KAINE: And they concluded that there was no reasonable prosecutor who would take it further. Sorry. QUIJANO: Senator Kaine, Governor Pence, please. KAINE: Syria. QUIJANO: I want to turn now to Syria. Two hundred fifty thousand people, 100,000 of them children, are under siege in Aleppo, Syria. Bunker buster bombs, cluster munitions, and incendiary weapons are being dropped on them by Russian and Syrian militaries. Does the U.S. have a responsibility to protect civilians and prevent mass casualties on this scale, Governor Pence? PENCE: The United States of America needs to begin to exercise strong leadership to protect the vulnerable citizens and over 100,000 children in Aleppo. Hillary Clinton’s top priority when she became secretary of state was the Russian reset, the Russians reset. After the Russian reset, the Russians invaded Ukraine and took over Crimea. And the small and bullying leader of Russia is now dictating terms to the United States to the point where all the United States of America — the greatest nation on Earth — just withdraws from talks about a cease-fire while Vladimir Putin puts a missile defense system in Syria while he marshals the forces and begins — look, we have got to begin to lean into this with strong, broad-shouldered American leadership. It begins by rebuilding our military. And the Russians and the Chinese have been making enormous investments in the military. We have the smallest Navy since 1916. We have the lowest number of troops since the end of the Second World War. We’ve got to work with Congress, and Donald Trump will, to rebuild our military and project American strength in the world. But about Aleppo and about Syria, I truly do believe that what America ought to do right now is immediately establish safe zones, so that families and vulnerable families with children can move out of those areas, work with our Arab partners, real time, right now, to make that happen. And secondly, I just have to tell you that the provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength. And if Russia chooses to be involved and continue, I should say, to be involved in this barbaric attack on civilians in Aleppo, the United States of America should be prepared to use military force to strike military targets of the Assad regime to prevent them from this humanitarian crisis that is taking place in Aleppo. There’s a broad range of other things that we ought to do, as well. We ought to deploy a missile defense shield to the Czech Republic and Poland which Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama pulled back on out of not wanting to offend the Russians back in 2009. QUIJANO: Governor, your two minutes are up. PENCE: We’ve just got to have American strength on the world stage. When Donald Trump becomes president of the United States, the Russians and other countries in the world will know they’re dealing with a strong American president. QUIJANO: Senator Kaine? KAINE: Hillary and I also agree that the establishment of humanitarian zones in northern Syria with the provision of international human aid, consistent with the U.N. Security Council resolution that was passed in February 2014, would be a very, very good idea. And Hillary also has the ability to stand up to Russia in a way that this ticket does not. Donald Trump, again and again, has praised Vladimir Putin. And it’s clear that he has business dealings with Russian oligarchs who are very connected to Putin. The Trump campaign management team had to be fired a month or so ago because of those shadowy connections with pro-Putin forces. Governor Pence made the odd claim, he said inarguably Vladimir Putin is a better leader than President Obama. Vladimir Putin has run his economy into the ground. He persecutes LGBT folks and journalists. If you don’t know the difference between dictatorship and leadership, then you got to go back to a fifth-grade civics class. I’ll tell you what offends me... PENCE: Well, that offended me. KAINE: Governor Pence just said — Governor Pence just said that Donald Trump will rebuild the military. No, he won’t. Donald Trump is avoiding paying taxes. The New York Times story — and we need to get this — but the New York Times suggested that he probably didn’t pay taxes for about 18 years starting in 1995. Those years included the years of 9/11. So get this. On 9/11, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump’s hometown was attacked by the worst terrorist attack in the history of the United States. Young men and women — young men and women signed up to serve in the military to fight terrorism. Hillary Clinton went to Washington to get funds to rebuild her city and protect first responders, but Donald Trump was fighting a very different fight. It was a fight to avoid paying taxes so that he wouldn’t support the fight against terror. QUIJANO: The question was about Aleppo, Senator. KAINE: He wouldn’t support troops. He wouldn’t — he wouldn’t support — this is important, Elaine. When a guy running for president will not support the troops, not support veterans, not support teachers, that’s really important. QUIJANO: Right. KAINE: And I said about Aleppo, we do agree the notion is we have to create a humanitarian zone in northern Syria. It’s very important. QUIJANO: Governor Pence, you had mentioned no-fly zone. Where would you propose setting up a safe zone specifically? How would you keep it safe? PENCE: Well, first and foremost, Donald Trump supports our troops. Donald Trump supports our veterans. KAINE: He won’t pay taxes. PENCE: Donald Trump has paid all the taxes that he’s — do you not take deductions? How does that work? QUIJANO: Gentlemen, this is about Syria. I’d like to... (CROSSTALK) PENCE: Honestly, Senator. Honestly, Senator. KAINE: It is about our troops. It is about our troops. PENCE: I understand why you want to change — I understand why you want to change the subject. KAINE: How can you support the troops if you won’t pay taxes? PENCE: I understand why you want to change the subject. And let me be very clear on this Russian thing. The larger question here... KAINE: Do you think Donald Trump is smart to not pay taxes? QUIJANO: Gentlemen, we’re going to have time to get to Russia here. PENCE: What we’re dealing with is the — you know, there’s an old proverb that says the Russian bear never dies, it just hibernates. And the truth of the matter is, the weak and feckless foreign policy of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama has awakened an aggression in Russia that first appeared a few years ago with their move in Georgia, now their move into Crimea, now their move into the wider Middle East. And all the while, all we do is fold our arms and say we’re not having talks anymore. To answer your question, we just need American strength. We need to — we need to marshal the resources of our allies in the region, and in the immediate, we need to act and act now to get people out of harm’s way. QUIJANO: And exactly how would those safe zones work? How would they remain safe? PENCE: The — the safe zones would have to be — as the senator said, there’s already a framework for this that’s been recognized by the international community. The United States of America needs to be prepared to work with our allies in the region to create a route for safe passage and then to protect people in those areas, including with a no-fly zone. But, look, this is very tough stuff. I served on the Foreign Affairs Committee for a decade. I traveled in and out of that region for 10 years. I saw what the American soldier won in Operation Iraqi Freedom. And to see the weak and feckless leadership that Hillary Clinton was the architect of and the foreign policy of the Obama administration... KAINE: Well, let me — let me come back... PENCE: ... is deeply troubling to me. That will all change the day Donald Trump becomes president of the United States. KAINE: ... and talk about — let me talk about the things that Governor Pence doesn’t want to acknowledge, Elaine. He doesn’t want to acknowledge that we stopped the Iranian nuclear weapons program. He doesn’t want to acknowledge... PENCE: We didn’t. KAINE: ... that Hillary was part of a team that got bin Laden. He doesn’t want to acknowledge... PENCE: I just did. KAINE: ... that it’s a good thing, not a bad thing, that it’s a good thing — not a bad thing — that we’re down from 175,000 troops deployed overseas to 15,000. But let me tell you what will really make the Middle East dangerous. Donald Trump’s idea that more nations should get nuclear weapons, Saudi Arabia, Japan, South Korea. Ronald Reagan said something really interesting about nuclear proliferation back in the 1980s. He said the problem with nuclear proliferation is that some fool or maniac could trigger a catastrophic event. And I think that’s who Governor Pence’s running mate is, exactly who Governor Reagan warned us about. PENCE: And come on. Senator. Senator, that was even beneath you and Hillary Clinton. And that — that’s pretty low. KAINE: But do you — do you think — do you think we should have — more nuclear weapons in the world will make us safer? PENCE: Senator, the... KAINE: That’s what Donald Trump thinks. PENCE: Ronald Reagan also said nuclear war should never be fought because it can never be won. And the United States of America needs to make investments in modernizing our nuclear force for both deterrence... KAINE: But can you defend Donald Trump’s claim that more nations should get nuclear weapons? PENCE: ... and assurance to our allies. But let me go back to this Iran thing. I mean, he keeps saying that they prevented — that Hillary Clinton started the deal with the Iranians prevented Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. (CROSSTALK) KAINE: That’s what the Israeli joint chiefs of staff is saying right now. PENCE: Well, that’s not what — that’s not what Israel thinks. KAINE: Gadi Eizenkot, you can go check it. PENCE: You wouldn’t necessarily know that. KAINE: Go to the tape. PENCE: I know you boycotted Prime Minister Netanyahu’s speech when he came before the Congress. KAINE: No, I visited him in his office. I visited him in his office. PENCE: You boycotted the speech. The point is, what this Iran — so-called Iran deal did was essentially guarantee — I mean, when I was in Congress, I fought hard on a bipartisan basis with Republican and Democrat members to move forward the toughest sanctions, it — literally in the history of the United States, against Iran. KAINE: And then Hillary used them to get a deal. PENCE: We were bringing them to heel, but the goal was always that we would only lift the sanctions if Iran permanently renounced their nuclear ambitions. KAINE: Elaine, let me just mention one thing. (CROSSTALK) PENCE: They have not — Elaine, let me finish a sentence. They have not renounced their nuclear ambitions. And when the deal’s period runs out, there’s no limitation on them obtaining weapons. That... (CROSSTALK) QUIJANO: And very quickly, Senator. KAINE: Elaine... PENCE: ... and the fact that they got $1.7 billion in a ransom payment... QUIJANO: We need to talk about Russia. Very quickly, though, Senator, please. PENCE: ... is astonishing to the American people. KAINE: Six times tonight, I have said to Governor Pence I can’t imagine how you can defend your running mate’s position on one issue after the next. And in all six cases, he’s refused to defend his running mate. PENCE: Well, let’s — no, no, don’t put words in my mouth. QUIJANO: All right. PENCE: He’s going... (CROSSTALK) KAINE: And yet he is asking everybody to vote for somebody that he cannot defend. And I just think that should be underlined. PENCE: No, I’m — look... (CROSSTALK) QUIJANO: All right, gentlemen, let’s talk about Russia. This is a topic that has come up. PENCE: I’m very, very happy to defend Donald Trump. If he wants to take these one at a time, I’ll take them one at a time. QUIJANO: I will give you an opportunity to do that. KAINE: More nations should get nuclear weapons. Try to defend that. PENCE: Don’t put words in my mouth. Well, he never said that, Senator. KAINE: He absolutely said it. Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Japan. PENCE: Most of the stuffy you’ve said, he’s never said. QUIJANO: Gentlemen, Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine, annexed Crimea, and has provided crucial military support to the Assad regime. What steps, if any, would your administration take to counter these actions? Senator Kaine? KAINE: You’ve got to be tough on Russia. So let’s start with not praising Vladimir Putin as a great leader. Donald Trump and Mike Pence have said he’s a great leader. And Donald Trump has business... PENCE: No, we haven’t. KAINE: ... has business dealings — has business dealings with Russia that he refuses to disclose. Hillary Clinton has gone toe-to- toe with Russia. She went toe-to-toe with Russia as secretary of state to do the New START Agreement to reduce Russia’s nuclear stockpile. She’s had the experience doing it. She went toe-to-toe with Russia and lodged protests when they went into Georgia. And we’ve done the same thing about Ukraine, but more than launching protests, we’ve put punishing economic sanctions on Russia that we need to continue. Donald Trump, on the other hand, didn’t know that Russia had invaded the Crimea. PENCE: Oh, that’s nonsense. KAINE: He was on a TV show a couple months back, and he said, “I’ll guarantee you this, Russia’s not going into the Ukraine.” And he had to be reminded that they had gone into the Crimea two years before. PENCE: He knew that. KAINE: Hillary Clinton has gone toe-to-toe with Russia to work out a deal on New START. She got them engaged on a meaningful way to cap Iran’s nuclear weapons program. And yet she stood up to them on issues such as Syria and their invasion of Georgia. You’ve got to have the ability to do that, and Hillary does. On the other hand, in Donald Trump, you have somebody who praises Vladimir Putin all the time. America should really wonder about a President Trump, who had a campaign manager with ties to Putin, pro- Putin elements in the Ukraine, who had to be fired for that reason. They should wonder — when Donald Trump is sitting down with Vladimir Putin, is it going to be America’s bottom line or is it going to be Donald Trump’s bottom line that he’s going to be worried about with all of his business dealings? Now, this could be solved if Donald Trump would be willing to release his tax returns, as he told the American public that he would do. And I know he’s laughing at this, but every president... PENCE: But what’s it got to do with Russia? KAINE: Every president since Richard Nixon has done it, and Donald Trump has said I’m doing business with Russia. The only way the American public will see whether he has a conflict of interest... PENCE: No, he hasn’t said that. KAINE: He has, actually. QUIJANO: Senator, your time is up. Governor? PENCE: Well, thanks. I’m just trying to keep up with the insult-driven campaign on the other side of the table. KAINE: You know, I’m just saying facts about your running mate. PENCE: Yeah. KAINE: And I know you can’t defend. QUIJANO: Senator, please. This is the governor’s two minutes. PENCE: I’m happy to defend him, Senator. Don’t put words in my mouth that I’m not defending him. KAINE: You’re not. PENCE: I’m happy to defend him. Most of what you said is completely false, and the American people know that. KAINE: I’ll run through the list of things where you won’t defend... PENCE: This isn’t the old days where you can just say stuff and people believe it. QUIJANO: Senator, please. This is Governor Pence’s two minutes. PENCE: Look, this is the alternative universe of Washington, D.C., versus reality. Hillary Clinton said her number-one priority was a reset with Russia. That reset resulted in the invasion of Ukraine, after they’d infiltrated with what are called little green men, Russian soldiers that were dressing up like Ukrainian dissidents, and then they moved all the way into Crimea, took over the Crimean Peninsula. Donald Trump knew that happened. He basically was saying it’s not going to happen again. The truth of the matter is that what you have in the rise of aggressive Russia, which has had — increased its influence in Iran, that’s now — now because of this deal is on a pathway in the future to obtain a nuclear — the leading state sponsor of terror in the world in Iran now has a closer working relationship with Russia because of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama’s foreign policy and $150 billion and sanctions all being lifted. And then, of course, Syria, I mean, it really is extraordinary that — Syria is imploding. You just asked a very thoughtful question about the disaster in Aleppo. ISIS is headquartered in Raqqa. It is — ISIS from Raqqa has overrun vast areas that at great sacrifice the American soldier won in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and yet Senator Kaine still sits here, loyal soldier — I get all that — in saying that the foreign policy of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama somehow made the world more secure. I mean, it really is astonishing that on the day... KAINE: We even wiped out the leader of Al Qaida. PENCE: ... on the day that Iran released four American hostages... KAINE: We stopped Iran from getting nuclear weapons. QUIJANO: Governor... PENCE: ... we delivered $400 million in cash as a ransom payment for Americans held by the radical mullahs in Tehran. (CROSSTALK) QUIJANO: Governor, yesterday, Mr. Trump said... KAINE: And we stopped a nuclear weapons program without a shot. QUIJANO: ... quote, “Putin has no respect for Hillary Clinton and no respect for Obama.” Why do you think he’ll respect a Trump- Pence administration? PENCE: Strength. Plain and simple. KAINE: Business dealings. PENCE: Donald Trump — that’s nonsense. Donald Trump is a strong leader... KAINE: Donald Trump’s son says that the Trump organization... PENCE: ... who is going to lead with American strength. QUIJANO: Please, Senator, I’ll give you a chance to respond. PENCE: We’re going to rebuild our military. And let me — let me — this whole Putin thing. Look, America is stronger than Russia. Our economy is 16 times larger than the Russian economy. America’s political system is superior to the crony, corrupt capitalist system in Russia in every way. When Donald Trump and I observe that, as I’ve said in Syria, in Iran, in Ukraine, that the small and bullying leader of Russia has been stronger on the world stage than this administration, that’s stating painful facts. That’s not an endorsement of Vladimir Putin. That’s an indictment of the weak and feckless leadership... QUIJANO: Senator Kaine? PENCE: ... of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. KAINE: Well, this is one where we can just kind of go to the tape on it. But Governor Pence said, inarguably, Vladimir Putin is a better leader than President Obama. PENCE: That is absolutely inaccurate. KAINE: And — and — and I just think a guy who praises... PENCE: He said he’s stronger — he’s been stronger on the world stage. KAINE: No, he said leader. And if — and I’ll just say this, Governor. PENCE: You just said better. KAINE: If you mistake leadership for dictatorship, and you can’t tell the difference, a country that’s running its economy into the ground... PENCE: Yeah, here we go. This is the grade school thing again? KAINE: ... persecuting journalists... PENCE: Right, this is grade school. KAINE: ... if you can’t tell the difference, you shouldn’t be commander-in-chief. PENCE: Yeah. KAINE: And with Donald Trump — Donald Trump’s sons say that they have all these business dealings with Russia. Those could be disclosed with tax returns, but they refuse to do them. Americans need to worry about whether Donald Trump will be watching out for America’s bottom line or his own bottom line. QUIJANO: Senator Kaine, what went wrong with the Russia reset? KAINE: Vladimir Putin. Vladimir Putin is a dictator. QUIJANO: And what would do you differently? KAINE: Vladimir Putin is a dictator. He’s not a leader. Anybody who thinks otherwise doesn’t know Russian history and they don’t know Vladimir Putin. Hillary Clinton knows exactly who this guy is. John McCain said, I look in his eyes and I see KGB. And Hillary kind of has that same feeling. PENCE: Right. KAINE: So how do deal with him? You’ve got to — we do have to deal with Russia in a lot of different ways. There are areas where we can cooperate. So it was Hillary Clinton who worked with Russia on the New START Treaty to reduce their nuclear weapons stockpile. It was Hillary Clinton that worked with Russia to get them engaged in a community of nations to stop the Iranian nuclear weapons without firing a shot. She’s not going around praising Vladimir Putin as a great guy. But she knows how to sit down at a table and negotiate tough deals. This is a very challenging part of the world, and we ought to have a commander-in-chief who is prepared and done it, rather than somebody who goes around praising Vladimir Putin as a great leader. QUIJANO: All right, I’d like to ask now about North Korea, Iran and the threat of nuclear weapons. North Korea recently conducted its fifth and most powerful nuclear test. PENCE: Right. QUIJANO: What specific steps would you take to prevent North Korea from developing a nuclear-armed missile capable of reaching the United States? Governor Pence? PENCE: Well, first, we need to — we need to make a commitment to rebuild our military, including modernizing our nuclear forces. And we also need — we also need an effective American diplomacy that will marshal the resources of nations in the Asian Pacific Rim to put pressure on North Korea, on Kim Jong-un, to abandon his nuclear ambitions. It has to remain the policy of the United States of America the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, plain and simple. And when Donald Trump is president of the United States, we’re — we’re not going to have the — the kind of posture in the world that has Russia invading Crimea and Ukraine, that has the Chinese building new islands in the South China Sea, that has literally the world, including North Korea, flouting American power. We’re going to — we’re going to go back to the days of peace through strength. But I have to tell you that — that all this talk about tax returns — and I get it, you know, you want to keep bringing that up. It must have — must have... KAINE: Until he... (CROSSTALK) PENCE: ... done well in some focus group. But here — Hillary Clinton and her husband set up a private foundation called the Clinton Foundation. While she was secretary of state, the Clinton Foundation accepted tens of millions of dollars from foreign governments and foreign donors. Now, you all need to know out there, this is basic stuff. Foreign donors, and certainly foreign governments, cannot participate in the American political process. They cannot make financial contributions. But the Clintons figured out a way to create a foundation where foreign governments and foreign donors could donate millions of dollars. And then we found, thanks to the good work of the Associated Press, that more than half her private meetings when she was secretary of state were given to major donors of the Clinton Foundation. When you talk about all these — all these baseless rumors about Russia and the rest, Hillary Clinton — you asked the trustworthy question at the very beginning — the reason... QUIJANO: Governor, your two minutes are up. PENCE: ... the reason the American people don’t trust Hillary Clinton is because they are looking at the pay to play politics that she operated with the Clinton Foundation through a private server... QUIJANO: Governor, please. PENCE: ... while she’s secretary of state. QUIJANO: Your two minutes are up, Governor. PENCE: And they’re saying enough is enough. QUIJANO: Senator Kaine? KAINE: I’m going to talk about the foundation, and then I’ll talk about North Korea. So, on the foundation. I am glad to talk about the foundation. The Clinton Foundation is one of the highest- rated charities in the world. It provides AIDS drugs to about 11.5 million people. It helps Americans deal with opioid overdoses. It gets higher rankings for its charity than the American Red Cross does. The Clinton foundation does an awful lot of good work. Hillary Clinton as secretary of state took no action to benefit the foundation. The State Department did an investigation, and they concluded that everything Hillary Clinton did as secretary of state was completely in the interest of the United States. So the foundation does good work. And Hillary Clinton as secretary of state acted in the interests of the United States. But let’s compare this now with the Trump organization and the Trump Foundation. The Trump organization is an octopus-like organization with tentacles all over the world whose conflict of interests could only be known if Donald Trump would release his tax returns. He’s refused to do it. His sons have said that the organization has a lot of business dealings in Russia. And remember, the Trump organization is not a non-profit. It’s putting money into Donald Trump’s pockets and into the pockets of his children, whereas the Clinton Foundation is a non- profit and no Clinton family member draws any salary. PENCE: The Trump Foundation is non-profit. KAINE: In addition, Donald Trump has a foundation. The foundation was just fined for illegally contributing foundation dollars to a political campaign of a Florida attorney general. They made an illegal contribution, and then they tried to hide it by disguising it to somebody else. And the person they donated to was somebody whose office was charged with investigating Trump University. This is the difference between a foundation that does good work and a secretary of state who acted in accordance with American interest and somebody who is conflicted and doing work around the world and won’t share with the American public what he’s doing and what those conflicts are. QUIJANO: Governor, I will give you 30 seconds to respond, because I know you want to, but, again, I would remind you both this was about North Korea. (LAUGHTER) PENCE: Well, Thank you. Thank you. The Trump Foundation is a private family foundation. They give virtually every cent in the Trump Foundation to charitable causes. KAINE: Political contributions? PENCE: Less than ten cents on the dollar in the Clinton Foundation has gone to charitable causes. KAINE: A $20,000 portrait of Donald Trump? PENCE: Less than 10 cents on the dollar of the Clinton Foundation has gone to charitable causes. KAINE: Ninety percent. PENCE: It has been a platform for the Clintons to travel the world, to have staff. But honestly, Senator, we would know a lot more about it if Hillary Clinton would just turn over the 33,000 e-mails... QUIJANO: All right, let’s turn back to North Korea... PENCE: ... that she refused to turn over in her private server... Q UIJANO: Senator Kaine... PENCE: ... and we’d have a much better picture of what the Clinton Foundation was about. Q UIJANO: Senator Kaine, if you had intelligence that North Korea was about to launch a missile, a nuclear-armed missile capable of reaching the United States, would you take preemptive action? KAINE: If we — look, a president should take action to defend the United States against imminent threat. You have to. A president has to do that. Now exactly what action, you would have to determine what your intelligence was, how certain you were of that intelligence, but you would have to take action. You asked the question about how do we deal with a North Korea. I’m on the Foreign Relations Committee. We just did an extensive sanctions package against North Korea. And interestingly enough, Elaine, the U.N. followed and did this — virtually the same package. Often China will use their veto in the Security Council to veto a package like that. They’re starting to get worried about North Korea, too. So they actually supported the sanctions package, even though many of the sanctions are against Chinese firms, Chinese financial institutions. So we’re working together with China, and we need to. China’s another one of those relationships where it’s competitive, it’s also challenging, and in times like North Korea, we have to be able to cooperate. Hillary understands that very well. She went once famously to China and stood up at a human rights meeting and looked them in the eye and said, “Women’s rights are human rights.” They didn’t want her to say that, but she did. But she’s also worked on a lot of diplomatic and important diplomatic deals with China. And that’s what it’s going to take. The thing I would worry a little bit about is that Donald Trump owes about $650 million to banks, including the Bank of China. I’m not sure he could stand up so tough to the people who have loaned him money. QUIJANO: All right. I’d like to turn to our next segment now. And in this, I’d like to focus on social issues. You have both been open about the role that faith has played in your lives. Can you discuss in detail a time when you struggled to balance your personal faith and a public policy position? Senator Kaine? KAINE: Yeah, that’s an easy one for me, Elaine. It’s an easy one. I’m really fortunate. I grew up in a wonderful household with great Irish Catholic parents. My mom and dad are sitting right here. I was educated by Jesuits at Rockhurst High School in Kansas City. My 40th reunion is in 10 days. And I worked with Jesuit missionaries in Honduras, now nearly 35 years ago, and they were the heroes of my life. I try to practice my religion in a very devout way and follow the teachings of my church in my own personal life. But I don’t believe in this nation, a First Amendment nation, where we don’t raise any religion over the other, and we allow people to worship as they please, that the doctrines of any one religion should be mandated for everyone. For me, the hardest struggle in my faith life was the Catholic Church is against the death penalty and so am I. But I was governor of a state, and the state law said that there was a death penalty for crimes if the jury determined them to be heinous. And so I had to grapple with that. When I was running for governor, I was attacked pretty strongly because of my position on the death penalty. But I looked the voters of Virginia in the eye and said, look, this is my religion. I’m not going to change my religious practice to get one vote, but I know how to take an oath and uphold the law. And if you elect me, I will uphold the law. And I was elected, and I did. It was very, very difficult to allow executions to go forward, but in circumstances where I didn’t feel like there was a case for clemency, I told Virginia voters I would uphold the law, and I did. That was a real struggle. But I think it is really, really important that those of us who have deep faith lives don’t feel that we could just substitute our own views for everybody else in society, regardless of their views. QUIJANO: Governor Pence? PENCE: Well, it’s a wonderful question. And my Christian faith is at the very heart of who I am. I was also raised in a wonderful family of faith. It was a church on Sunday morning and grace before dinner. PENCE: But my Christian faith became real for me when I made a personal decision for Christ when I was a freshman in college. And I’ve tried to live that out however imperfectly every day of my life since. And with my wife at my side, we’ve followed a calling into public service, where we’ve — we’ve tried to — we’ve tried to keep faith with the values that we cherish. And with regard to when I struggle, I appreciate, and — and — and — I have a great deal of respect for Senator Kaine’s sincere faith. I truly do. KAINE: That’s shared. PENCE: But for me, I would tell you that for me the sanctity of life proceeds out of the belief that — that ancient principle that — where God says before you were formed in the womb, I knew you, and so for my first time in public life, I sought to stand with great compassion for the sanctity of life. The state of Indiana has also sought to make sure that we expand alternatives in health care counseling for women, non-abortion alternatives. I’m also very pleased at the fact we’re well on our way in Indiana to becoming the most pro-adoption state in America. I think if you’re going to be pro-life, you should — you should be pro- adoption. But what I can’t understand is with Hillary Clinton and now Senator Kaine at her side is to support a practice like partial-birth abortion. I mean, to hold to the view — and I know Senator Kaine, you hold pro-life views personally — but the very idea that a child that is almost born into the world could still have their life taken from them is just anathema to me. And I cannot — I can’t conscience about — about a party that supports that. Or that — I know you’ve historically opposed taxpayer funding of abortion. But Hillary Clinton wants to — wants to repeal the longstanding provision in the law where we said we wouldn’t use taxpayer dollars to fund abortion. So for me, my faith informs my life. I try and spend a little time on my knees every day. But it all for me begins with cherishing the dignity, the worth, the value of every human life. KAINE: Elaine, this is a fundamental question, a fundamental question. Hillary and I are both people out of religious backgrounds, from Methodist church experience, which was really formative for her as a public servant. But we really feel like you should live fully and with enthusiasm the commands of your faith. But it is not the role of the public servant to mandate that for everybody else. So let’s talk about abortion and choice. Let’s talk about them. We support Roe v. Wade. We support the constitutional right of American women to consult their own conscience, their own supportive partner, their own minister, but then make their own decision about pregnancy. That’s something we trust American women to do that. And we don’t think that women should be punished, as Donald Trump said they should, for making the decision to have an abortion. Governor Pence wants to repeal Roe v. Wade. He said he wants to put it on the ash heap of history. And we have some young people in the audience who weren’t even born when Roe was decided. This is pretty important. Before Roe v. Wade, states could pass criminal laws to do just that, to punish women if they made the choice to terminate a pregnancy. I think you should live your moral values. But the last thing, the very last thing that government should do is have laws that would punish women who make reproductive choices. And that is the fundamental difference between a Clinton-Kaine ticket and a Trump- Pence ticket that wants to punish women who make that choice. PENCE: No, it’s really not. Donald Trump and I would never support legislation that punished women who made the heartbreaking choice to end a pregnancy. KAINE: Then why did Donald Trump say that? PENCE: We just never would. KAINE: Why did he say that? PENCE: Well, look, it’s — look, he’s not a polished politician like you and Hillary Clinton. And so... KAINE: Well, I would admit that’s not a polished... (CROSSTALK) PENCE: You know, things don’t always come out exactly the way he means them. KAINE: Well, can I say... PENCE: But I’m telling you what the policy of our administration would be. KAINE: Great line from the — great line from the gospel of Matthew. From the fullness of the heart, the mouth speaks. PENCE: Yeah. KAINE: When Donald Trump says women should be punished or Mexicans are rapists and criminals... PENCE: I’m telling you... KAINE: ... or John McCain is not a hero, he is showing you who he is. PENCE: Senator, you’ve whipped out that Mexican thing again. He — look... KAINE: Can you defend it? PENCE: There are criminal aliens in this country, Tim, who have come into this country illegally who are perpetrating violence and taking American lives. KAINE: You want to — you want to use a big tar brush against Mexicans on that? PENCE: He also said and many of them are good people. You keep leaving that out of your quote. And if you want me to go there, I’ll go there. But here’s — there is a choice, and it is a choice on life. I couldn’t be more proud to be standing with Donald Trump, who’s standing for the right to life. It’s a principle that — Senator Kaine — and I’m very gentle about this, because I really do respect you — it’s a principle that you embrace. And I have appreciated the fact that you’ve supported the Hyde amendment, which bans the use of taxpayer funding for abortion, in the past, but that’s not Hillary Clinton’s view. People need to understand, we can come together as a nation. We can create a culture of life. More and more young people today are embracing life because we know we are — we’re better for it. We can — like Mother Teresa said at that famous national prayer breakfast... KAINE: This is important — PENCE: ... bring the — let’s welcome the children into our world. There are so many families around the country who can’t have children. We could improve adoption... KAINE: But, Governor... PENCE: ... so that families that can’t have children can adopt more readily those children from crisis pregnancies. KAINE: Governor, why don’t you trust women to make this choice for themselves? We can encourage people to support life. Of course we can. But why don’t you trust women? Why doesn’t Donald Trump trust women to make this choice for themselves? That’s what we ought to be doing in public life. Living our lives of faith or motivation with enthusiasm and excitement, convincing other, dialoguing with each other about important moral issues of the day... PENCE: Because there are... KAINE: ... but on fundamental issues of morality, we should let women make their own decisions. PENCE: Because there is — a society can be judged by how it deals with its most vulnerable, the aged, the infirm, the disabled, and the unborn. I believe it with all my heart. And I couldn’t be more proud to be standing with a pro-life candidate in Donald Trump. QUIJANO: I do have one final question for you both tonight. It has been a divisive campaign. Senator Kaine, if your ticket wins, what specifically are you going to do to unify the country and reassure the people who voted against you? KAINE: That’s a really important one. That may be the $64,000 question, because it has been a divisive campaign. And again, Hillary is running a campaign about stronger together, and Donald Trump — and this is — this is not directed at this man, except to the extent that he can’t defend Donald Trump — Donald Trump has run a campaign that’s been about one insult after the next. But we do have to bring the country together. So here’s what we’ll do. Hillary Clinton was first lady, then senator for eight years and secretary of state. And I served in the Senate. And I’m really amazed, Elaine, as I talk to Republican senators, how well they regard and respect Hillary Clinton. She was on the Armed Services Committee. She was on other committees. She worked across the aisle when she was first lady to get the CHIP program passed so that 8 million low-income kids have health insurance in this country, including 150,000 in Indiana. She worked across the aisle after 9/11 to get health benefits for the first responders who bravely went into the towers and into the Pentagon. She worked to get benefits for — TRICARE benefits for National Guard members, including Hoosiers and Virginians in the National Guard. She has a track record of working across the aisle to make things happen. And, you know, Elaine, I have the same track record. I was a governor of Virginia with two Republican houses. And in the Senate, I have good working relationships across the aisle. Because I think it’s fine to be a Democrat or Republican or independent, but after Election Day, the goal is work together. And Hillary Clinton has a track record of accomplishment across the aisle that will enable her to do just that when we work with the new Congress in January. QUIJANO: Governor, how will you unify the country if you win? PENCE: Well, thank you, Elaine, and thanks for a great discussion... KAINE: Absolutely. PENCE: ... tonight. Thank you, Senator. This is a very challenging time in the life of our nation. Weakened America’s place in the world after the leadership of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama on the world stage has been followed by an economy that is truly struggling, stifled by an avalanche of more taxes, more regulation, Obamacare, the war on coal, and the kind of trade deals that have put American workers in the back seat. I think the best way that we can bring people together is through change in Washington, D.C. You know, I served in Washington, D.C., for 12 years in the Congress of the United States. And I served with many Republicans and Democrats, men and women of goodwill. The potential is there to really change the direction of this country, but it’s going to take leadership to do it. The American people want to see our nation standing tall on the world stage again. They want to see us supporting our military, rebuilding our military, commanding the respect of the world, and they want to see the American economy off to the races again. They want to see an American comeback. And Donald Trump’s entire career has been about building. It’s been about — it’s going through hardship just like a businessperson does and finding a way through smarts and ingenuity and resilience to fight forward and — when Donald Trump becomes president of the United States, we’re going to have a stronger America. When you hear him say he wants to make America great again, when we do that, I truly do believe the American people are going to be standing taller. They’re going to see that real change can happen after decades of just talking about it. And when that happens, the American people are going to stand tall, stand together, and we’ll have the kind of unity that’s been missing for way too long. QUIJANO: All right, gentlemen, thank you so much. This concludes the vice presidential debate. My thanks to the candidates, the commission, and to you for watching. Please tune in this Sunday for the second presidential debate at Washington University in St. Louis and the final debate on October 19th at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. From Farmville, Virginia, I’m Elaine Quijano of CBS News. Good night. An earlier version of this article, transcribed and provided by the Federal News Service, quoted incorrectly from an exchange between Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia and Gov.

"Debate Over Paris Climate Deal Could Turn on a Single Phrase","Advertisement Supported by By  John Schwartz WASHINGTON — The debate within the Trump administration over what to do about the Paris climate agreement has reached a critical phase, according to people familiar with the internal negotiations. The decision could hinge on the interpretation of a single phrase in a single provision of a document that took years to write. The question is whether to walk away from the agreement sealed by the Obama administration and nearly 200 other nations at the end of 2015 — as Donald J. Trump promised as a presidential candidate to do — or to weaken the nation’s commitment under the deal to reducing greenhouse gases while remaining in the accord. The provision at issue, Article 4.11, states that a nation “may at any time adjust its existing nationally determined contribution with a view to enhancing its level of ambition.” The question is whether the ability to “adjust” is like a ratchet, allowing progress only in one direction — upward — or if it permits a country to weaken its commitment without violating the terms of the deal. The fight within the White House over what to do about the Paris deal has been going on for months . One side, led by the president’s chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, and Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, has argued that the language of the provision does not allow nations to weaken their commitments. They urge the president to withdraw entirely from the Paris deal. Another faction, which includes the president’s daughter Ivanka Trump and Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and colleagues, believes that the agreement does allow downward adjustments to nations’ goals and targets, and that the administration should modify the commitment, not walk away. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, too, has called for the administration to “renegotiate” the climate pact without withdrawing from it. If Mr. Bannon’s side of the debate wins the contest for Mr. Trump’s approval, the announcement of a decision to withdraw from the climate deal could come as early as next week. The two sides clashed over the issue in a meeting on Thursday, when the White House Counsel’s Office surprised Ms. Trump by suggesting that Mr. Pruitt’s faction might have the law on its side, Politico reported . The conflict led to an unusual meeting on Monday involving lawyers from several government agencies, reportedly including the White House, the Justice Department and the State Department. Among the hard-line opponents of action against climate change both inside and outside the White House, the strong resistance to the notion that the Paris agreement includes downward flexibility is accompanied by warnings that efforts to relax commitments will lead to burdensome lawsuits from activists. Christopher C. Horner, a senior legal fellow at the Energy and Environment Legal Institute, said liberal state attorneys general and climate activists would inevitably sue over efforts to weaken the targets. “This will be most aggressive in the Ninth Circuit, which hopefully triggers some memories in the minds of administration lawyers,” he said, referring to the fight over the administration’s immigration plan, which has been stayed by the California-based federal appeals court. “Despite the mad rush to insist that plain language means either the opposite of what it says, or else nothing at all, under any canon of construction, Article 4 does not permit revisions downward,” Mr. Horner said. “The language is deliberate and reads only one way: the way it was written and, as the context affirms, was plainly intended.” The officials aligned with Ms. Trump and Mr. Tillerson, however, have suggested privately that the legal theory of a strictly binding agreement is little more than a ploy to force the administration to pull out of the deal. Todd D. Stern, the lead climate negotiator in the Obama administration and an expert on the deal, said negotiators wrote the flexibility to reduce targets into the agreement by careful design. “It wasn’t like, ‘Boy, nobody thought of that,’” he said. The issue was discussed intensely in Paris, he explained. “There were countries that wanted to say, ‘Thou shalt not, you are precluded from adjusting now.’ We did not want to do that,” he said. Downward adjustment had already occurred with climate commitments. Japan, after losing nuclear power facilities in the Fukushima disaster, had to adjust its targets downward. The United States had feared that without the ability to adjust targets, countries would lowball their commitments, Mr. Stern said. He said leaving the Paris agreement would be a “serious mistake” that would have grave consequences: “I think it would produce broad collateral damage for the U.S. internationally.” The question of whether the administration will leave the climate agreement has drawn broad opposition from the nation’s trading partners and businesses, and even from fossil fuel companies. In a recent letter to administration officials, Exxon Mobil called the agreement “an effective framework for addressing the risks of climate change .” At the coal company Cloud Peak Energy, a spokesman, Rick Curtsinger, said, “We do believe that it needs to be amended, but think that it’s important to stay at the negotiating table.” Colin Marshall, the company’s chief executive, sent a letter to Mr. Trump on April 6 urging him to remain in the Paris agreement, “albeit with a much different pledge on emissions,” and to promote technologies that can reduce the greenhouse gases produced by the use of coal. Other nations have urged the United States to remain at the Paris table, including Britain , Canada and Australia, where Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has said his country will stay in the deal even if the United States withdraws. Maros Sefcovic , a vice president of the European Commission, has urged American officials to stick with the agreement, but has also said that if not, “we are ready to continue to provide the leadership on climate change.” An article on Wednesday on the debate within the Trump administration over the Paris climate agreement misquoted Todd D. Stern, the lead climate negotiator in the Obama administration. He said it would be a “serious mistake” to leave the Paris agreement; he did not say lowering United States commitments under the agreement would be a serious mistake.

"President Trump, Brexit, Syria: Your Friday Briefing","Advertisement Supported by Let us help you start your day. By  Penn Bullock (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up .) Good morning. President Trump plans to declare a national emergency, Amazon nixes a New York headquarters and Britain’s Parliament delivered more Brexit chaos. Here’s the latest: A two-month war of attrition between the president and Congress has effectively ended, but at the possible cost of a new battle. The White House announced that President Trump would sign a border deal passed by the Senate that averts a partial government shutdown, but also that he would declare a national emergency in order to circumvent Congress and unilaterally allocate billions of dollars for his promised border wall. Here’s how a national emergency declaration would work. It could provoke a constitutional clash between the president and Congress over control of the federal purse . Lawmakers would have two avenues of opposition : legislation, which Mr. Trump could veto, and the courts. Legal specialists warned of high long-term costs to American democracy . Other news from Washington: Andrew McCabe, the former deputy F.B.I. director, said the agency was so alarmed by Mr. Trump’s decision to fire the bureau’s director, James Comey, in 2017 that Justice Department officials considered encouraging cabinet members to invoke a constitutional amendment to remove him from office . And the Senate confirmed William Barr as attorney general, despite concerns from Democrats that he might not make public the findings of his department’s Russia investigation. The technology giant announced that it would not “move forward” with plans to build a sprawling corporate campus in Long Island City, Queens , after stiff opposition from some local lawmakers and unions empowered by the rise of Democratic political strength. Amazon had forecast that the campus would have created more than 25,000 jobs. The opposition: A point of contention was the $3 billion package of incentives and subsidies the city and state agreed to — their largest ever, dedicated to one of the world’s richest companies. City officials had also agreed to remake plans for the Queens waterfront and give the company’s chief, Jeff Bezos, access to a helicopter pad. There was also concern over the company’s anti-union practices and the changes its huge presence would bring to Queens. Before Amazon’s announcement, we looked at the resistance . Prime Minister Theresa May’s efforts to salvage her Brexit plan suffered a significant parliamentary defeat . Details: Parliament rejected a motion in support of Mrs. May’s tattered Brexit strategy, which hinges on reopening negotiations with the E.U. The motion was intended to reassure the E.U. that Parliament would back Mrs. May in any negotiations. Instead, lawmakers show that they aren’t rallying around her or any plan. The debate: The motion was defeated because of a widening divide within the Conservative Party over whether Britain should take a “no-deal” Brexit off the table. Hard-line Brexit supporters want to lord the possibility over the E.U. as leverage, and sunk the motion to assert that prerogative. But the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, warned Britain that the balance of power was not in its favor and that it was becoming a “middling economy.” Looking ahead: Several ministers are threatening to resign if Mrs. May hasn’t secured a revised deal with the E.U. by Feb. 27. Some analysts believe the outcome of Brexit will remain unclear until a few days before the March 29 deadline. As the U.S. works with the Taliban on a peace deal to end nearly two decades of war, many young Afghans worry that the basic liberties they have become used to under a civilian government could be at risk. This year, Valentine’s Day turned into a day of protest, with poetry expressing not love but fear. One verse in particular — “I kiss you amid the Taliban” — has become a rallying cry. Background: Last month, the Taliban and U.S. negotiators agreed in principle to a framework for the phased withdrawal of American troops, but the Afghan government has been left out of the process. Women in particular have voiced concerns about their rights. E.U. economy: The German economy did not grow in the year’s final quarter, the government said. The news is partly an effect of President Trump’s trade policies and is a bad sign for Europe, where the middle-class has shrunk in most places since the late-2000s recession. Iran: Vice President Mike Pence lashed out at Britain, France and Germany at a conference on Middle East security, accusing them of trying to “break American sanctions” against Iran and demanding that they abandon the Iranian nuclear accord. His attempts to wrangle an anti-Iran alliance led to awkward moments . Switzerland: A warmer climate is rapidly melting away most of the glaciers in the Alps , and engineers are adjusting their approach to the country’s biggest energy source — water. Climate change: Thousands of young people in Britain are expected to take to the streets on Friday to join a growing youth-led movement across Europe protesting insufficient action on climate change. India: Prompting comparisons to censorship in China, India’s government proposed giving itself enormous new powers to suppress internet content . Critics say the regulations would be unconstitutional. Egypt: The country’s Parliament approved a sweeping measure that clears the way for President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi to stay in power until 2034 , further entrenching his authoritarian rule and the military’s dominance. Chad: French airstrikes against Chadian rebels this month in support of Chad’s longtime autocratic ruler , Idriss Déby, unsettled members of the opposition and resurfaced questions about whether France operates as a neocolonial power in parts of Africa. Sweden: The country placed its ambassador to China under investigation after she was accused of arranging unauthorized, secret talks to free a detained Swedish bookseller. Britain: A 19-year-old woman who left Britain in 2015 to join ISIS and recently fled its last speck of territory in Syria told a newspaper that she was nine months pregnant and wanted to come home . But her future is deeply uncertain. Ryan Adams: Seven women and over a dozen associates came forward with accounts of how the prolific singer-songwriter dangled career opportunities while pursuing female artists for sex. He has denied the accusations. London: The Japanese architect Junya Ishigami will design this year’s Serpentine Pavilion , a temporary structure put up each summer in Hyde Park. Overlooked no more: Mabel Grammer’s self-run adoption agency made it possible for marginalized mixed-race children in Germany to find homes after World War II. She didn’t get a Times obituary, until now . Recipe of the day: Looking for a light meal? Serve simmered kabocha squash over rice with a fried egg.

Our Back Story on Wednesday on the Fahrenheit and Celsius scales included a fact surprising to us: The temperature scale devised by Anders Celsius in the early 18th century set the boiling point at zero degrees and the freezing point at 100, the opposite of current use. It was also a surprise to some readers, who wrote in to ask whether we had our facts straight. Fortunately, we did. Celsius, from Sweden, wanted to be able to measure frigid temperatures without using negative numbers , because the minus sign could be overlooked, resulting in errors.

"Rand Paul announces presidential bid with promises of 'liberty and limited government'","The US senator from Kentucky is the second declared Republican candidate in what is expected to be a crowded 2016 field  Paul Lewis in Louisville, Kentucky  Tue 7 Apr 2015 16.09 BST   Last modified on Wed 29 Nov 2017 20.31 GMT   Republican senator Rand Paul launched his campaign for the presidency on Tuesday with a moderated version of the libertarianism he hopes will set him apart from the congested field of candidates vying for the conservative base. At a campaign at a rally in his home state of Kentucky, Paul promised tax cuts, term limits for congressmen and an immediate end to “warrantless surveillance” by the National Security Agency as part of return to constitutional principles he said would “take our country back”. He did so in tones that are unusual for a Republican candidate – speaking at length about inner-city poverty and promising to repeal “any law that disproportionately incarcerates people of colour”. His speech was critical of both Republicans and Democrats, quoting Martin Luther King in one breath and Ronald Reagan in the next. His formal entry into the contest marks a key moment in the nascent race for the Republican nomination, which is set to be the most congested presidential primary either party has held since 1976. There could be more than 10 presidential hopefuls vying for the Republican ticket, none of whom has so far emerged as a clear frontrunner. Paul is the first of the four leading contenders who are polling best in the early caucus and primary states to formally declare his candidacy. The others – former Florida governor Jeb Bush, Wisconsin governor Scott Walker and Florida senator Marco Rubio – are expected to announce in the coming weeks. Ted Cruz, the Texas senator most closely aligned with the Tea Party, became the first Republican to announce his candidacy last month, but is one of a larger pool of second-tier presidential aspirants. Paul, a 52-year-old ophthalmologist elected to the US Senate in 2010, stands apart from the field of likely Republican candidates on non-economic issues. He supports, for example, the moderation of marijuana laws and Washington’s recent rapprochement with Cuba. His speech on Tuesday was squarely directed at the Republican party faithful that will select who will run against the presumptive Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton, in 2016. His address to supporters in a downtown hotel in Louisville was a purist articulation of American political ideals combined with an effort to convince conservative sceptics he has the muscle to be commander-in-chief. Senior operatives in Paul’s campaign concede privately that perceptions that his libertarian-infused philosophy renders him soft on national security are perhaps his greatest weakness in the nomination phase. Foreign policy has been rising up the agenda for Republican primary voters, particularly since the emergence of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, forcing Paul to moderate his position in recent months, even backing an increase in military spending. On Tuesday, he was was sure to throw red meat to the hawks in his party. “Without question we must defend ourselves and American interests from our enemies, but until we name the enemy, we can’t win the war,” he said. “The enemy is radical Islam. You can’t get around it. And not only will I name the enemy, I will do whatever it takes to defend America from these haters of mankind.” But in a nod to his more libertarian roots, he advocated a foreign policy that “encourages stability, not chaos” and added: “I see an America strong enough to deter foreign aggression, yet wise enough to avoid unnecessary intervention.” Paul told the crowd of enthusiastic supporters that he envisioned an American national defence that is “unparalleled, undefeatable and unencumbered by overseas nation-building”. His father, Ron Paul, 79, a former a Texan congressman, who is more unequivocally critical of American imperialism, was on the stage but kept a low profile, sitting on the far side, in the corner. The senator did not refer to him by name but opened his speech by thanking “my parents”. Rand Paul hopes draw on the considerable libertarian network constructed by his father during his three attempts to run for president, without being painted as his political heir apparent, or alienating the hawks in the party who saw Ron Paul as a dangerous radical. Ron Paul came third and second in the Iowa and New Hampshire caucus and primary in 2012, buoyed by an enthusiastic base of younger libertarian activists, but never broke through as a credible contender. Yet even in its diluted form, the younger Paul’s libertarian brand promises an unusual mix of free-market, anti-regulation economics with positions on criminal justice and foreign policy that will appeal to younger voters, anti-war campaigners, civil libertarians and others on the left. The perils of that unorthodox approach were immediately apparent as he was attacked by well-funded opponents on both the left and right. The Democratic mega-donor Tom Steyer, a hedge fund manager seeking to make the environment something more than a marginal issue in the 2016 presidential race, sent activists to the riverside Louisville hotel where Paul made his announcement to draw attention to questions he has raised about the science behind climate change. Steyer’s group hired a mezzanine in Galt House hotel – the same facility rented by Paul on the banks of the Ohio river – to hang banners reading: “Senator Paul, Young Voters Won’t Be Fooled.” Meanwhile, a conservative nonprofit unveiled a of TV ad railing against Paul over his support for nuclear negotiations with Iran. Rick Reed, who runs Foundation for a Secure and Prosperous America, which is paying for the ads to be broadcast from Wednesday, is the same Republican operative who orchestrated the “Swiftboat Veterans for Truth Campaign” that was hugely damaging to Democrat John Kerry’s presidential campaign in 2004. “Rand Paul is wrong and dangerous,” a narrator on the ad says. “Tell him to stop siding with Obama.” The ad ends with the image of a nuclear mushroom cloud and the words: “One Iranian bomb would be a disaster.” The ad will run from Wednesday in all four early-nomination states Paul is traveling to. Perhaps surprisingly, Paul did not waver from his position on the Iran negotiations, saying only that the deal should be approved by Congress – a position shared by many in the legislature, including some Democrats. He said he was worried about statements Iran had made about the framework nuclear agreement, and raised concerns that Barack Obama may “unilaterally and prematurely halt sanctions”. But unlike all the other probable Republican candidates, Paul did not directly criticise the emerging nuclear deal, saying only that he could not support an agreement “that does not end Iran’s nuclear ambitions and have strong verification measures”. “Everyone needs to realise that negotiations are not inherently bad,” he added. “Our goal always should be and always is peace, not war.” His attempt to prove his commander-in-chief bona fides will reach a crescendo on Thursday, when he gives a speech in front of the USS Yorktown, a decommissioned war ship docked on the South Carolina coast. The South Carolina stop is part of an unusually ambitious five-day, five-state tour to kickstart Paul’s presidential campaign that will also see him travel to three other early nomination states: New Hampshire, Iowa and Nevada. He intends to galvanise support among the party’s base, including evangelical Christians, while broadening the party’s support. The rows of multi-racial faces that formed the stage backdrop during Paul’s rally in Louisville were intended, his aides said, to “look like America”. The carefully selected row of supporters consisted of only one white man with a long beard – the libertarian stereotype. Neither was there the quorum of ponytails and scruffy students that would typically be expected at one of his father’s rallies. But the crowd certainly looked more mixed than a traditional Republican event. Brandon Shepherd, a 22-year-old student – sporting beard, ponytail and scruffy jacket – said he was drawn to Paul’s message of “small government, more focus on the economy here and less involvement in world affairs”. He was undeterred by Paul’s recent foreign policy shifts, or his ambiguous answers on climate change and gay rights which, Shepherds said, were probably at odds with his own views. “I understand he’s got to do that,” he said. “He’s trying to appeal to the Republican party.”  National Republicans are going to do very little between now and November 2016. Instead, says Jeb Lund , you have would-be presidential clowns"
"Could Iran's high profile executions change capital punishment laws?","From Reyhaneh Jabbari, to Balal, famous cases are shifting the discourse on human rights in the Islamic republic Marketa Hulpachova for Tehran Bureau  Fri 16 May 2014 11.47 BST   Last modified on Mon 16 Nov 2015 12.42 GMT   Earlier this spring, film director Asghar Farhadi wrote an emotional open letter on behalf of a woman who faced execution for fatally stabbing a man who had tried to rape her. Twenty-six-year-old Reyhaneh Jabbari has been behind bars for seven years after the man’s relatives demanded capital punishment under ghesas, a Sharia-based legal code based on reciprocal justice. Jabari’s case has stirred controversy at home and abroad, and has been the subject of a passionate debate in private discussions and the Persian-language blogosphere. Still, Farhadi had to craft his sentences carefully when addressing the issue in Iran’s public sphere, where an entirely different set of rules apply. While Iran’s clerical establishment has been known to show a surprising level of leniency on a host of sensitive sociocultural topics, cornerstone Islamic legal principles such as ghesas present an immovable red line. One recent illustration is the March closing of the newspaper Aseman , which lost its publishing license after its editors made a passing reference to a critical discussion about ghesas in a bank-page article. Two days earlier, the same newspaper had, without ramification, printed a front-page feature about the first domestic publication of The Colonel, a politically charged novel that criticizes the1979 revolution and had been banned in Iran for decades. To avoid prodding the system in one of its most sensitive spots, Iranian intellectuals and human rights activists have only one tool at their disposal. Since they cannot criticize the practice of ghesas and capital punishment itself, they emphasize the option of mercy, or rahmat, which allows victims to forgive the perpetrator up to seconds before the scheduled execution. While the ultimate choice between punishment and forgiveness rest with the victim or the victim’s relatives, a combination of social pressures and the system’s own preference to relegate ghesas to remedial punishments, such as fines or imprisonment, are highly influential. This results in periodic phenomena like the case of Balal, a young man whose 16 April execution was halted after the mother of the man Balal was convicted of killing relinquished her right to ghesas as Balal stood on the scaffold. Unlike other categories of crimes in the Iranian penal code, which leave the administration of punishment in the hands of the Islamic jurisprudent, ghesas are crimes that involve murder and bodily injury, and thus emphasize the rights of the victim. In traditional Islamic societies, the families of a murder victim had the right to eye-for-an-eye retaliation that remains codified in the modern Iranian legal system. The difference is that the state - not the victims - are responsible for carrying out the actual punishment. Under Iranian law, everything from sodomy to blasphemy against the Prophet Mohammad is subject to capital punishment, but only in the case of ghesas does the weight of the decision lie outside the realm of the state. Watchdog groups have warned of a general surge in the number of executions since the start of Hassan Rouhani’s presidency. However, Iranian legal scholars have also noted that on the whole, judges prefer to relegate a majority of capital and corporal punishments to monetary penalties, or deyet. But since the judiciary cannot directly influence the punishment for a ghesas case, the option of mercy and forgiveness, enshrined as it is in Sharia law, presents a unique opportunity for all groups striving to reform the system from within. On one hand, mercy represents a lone bridge between rights advocates and Iran’s conservative ruling class, which has on multiple occasions demonstrated a willingness to reform human rights laws in the country if they are based on homegrown Islamic principles. International criticism of Iran’s human rights standards, such as the European parliament’s recent resolution , is generally poorly received by conservative political groups inside the country, who associate the outside pressure with colonialism and ulterior foreign policy motives. Still, the human rights topic presents an issue of legitimacy for the clerical ruling class, whose members struggle to reconcile the traditional reading of Sharia with modern legal norms emphasizing reconciliation over retribution. “In the context of complex political wrangling within Iran’s multifaceted state, hard-line state agents move toward universal human rights by actually reclaiming an enlightened heritage and nativizing human rights as the measure of Islam’s capacity for mercy ,” writes University of Washington scholar Arzoo Oshanloo. On the other hand, mercy and “the spectacle of the scaffold” provide the system with a dangerous tool that demonstrates authoritarian power to domestic audiences while projecting a more humanitarian image of the country to international critics. “The Islamic Republic of Iran simultaneously mobilizes multiple modes of power in an effort to show how it is authentic and global, modern and Islamic, and perhaps most important, merciful and just,” Osanloo writes. “The spectacular performance of Islamic penal justice is an exertion of state power that lends greater credence to the authority of a modern state.” The authoritarian nature of the state makes Brown University’s Mehrangiz Kar, a prominent human rights lawyer, skeptical about Iran’s ability to reform capital punishment laws according to its own rules. She points to the absence of an independent judiciary, as well as a highly politicized system in which judges and lawmakers are more concerned with preserving their own interests than reforming outdated laws and administering fair rulings. In addition, the Iranian legal system allows gender and creed-based discrimination, which is in direct contrast to basic human rights principles, Kar said. “One cannot be too hopeful about the reform of laws based on religious beliefs that assigns differential values to human life,” she told Tehran Bureau. However, Kar notes that even Iran does not exist in a bubble. Since the strict interpretations of Shari’a were only imposed in recent decades, capital punishment is more controversial in Iran than elsewhere in the Middle East, as Iranian society “had no memory of these kinds of harsh punishments until the Islamic Revolution,” she said. This lack of experience means more social discussion and changing beliefs affected by international norms. However, impact on the system itself is low due to the dearth of spaces for free public discussion. “If we had freedom of speech, there might be hope of ghesas reform,” Kar said. “For now, all we have as an outlet is cyberspace, as anyone who criticizes the system from the outside gets accused of supporting Western imperialism.” Still, the mercy concept allows a small handful of prominent figures to address public sentiments without falling outside the framework of regime-approved discourse. These include Adel Ferdosipour , the outspoken sports commentator whose pleas for forgiveness proved influential in Balal’s case, as well as director Farhadi , who supported Jabbari with a broad appeal for tolerance and solidarity. “In our society, forgiving even in small doses has been forgotten,” he wrote, addressing the family of Jabbari’s alleged assailant on the front pages of the reformist daily Shargh. “Perhaps it is more meaningful for your loss to forgive [Jabbari] for the sake of humanity.” Progress towards a comprehensive settlement slows to a crawl as detailed drafting begins How far should Iran go to resolve concerns over past weapons research to reach a comprehensive deal?

"A Very Modern Take on a Classic Chinese Painting","For a visual survey of recent headline-grabbing events in China, look no further than the latest photographic project by the artist Dai Xiang, inspired by the 12th-century scroll painting âAlong the River During the Qingming Festival.â Mr. Dai borrows the visual and conceptual framework of that painting â not to mention its title â to produce a patchwork of meticulous vignettes of everyday Chinese society. But in a bid to channel the spirit of the times, he swaps out the sentimental depictions of urban life in the Song dynasty for scenes that are far more familiar to modern-day residents of Chinese cities: chengguan, or urban management officials, bullying local vendors; rapacious real estate developers mapping out plans to forcibly evict residents; government officials in dark suits on inspection tours; propaganda banners; crackdowns on prostitution; and snap-happy Chinese tourists wielding cameras. âIâve always wanted to make a scroll that depicts a slice of Chinese contemporary society in a way that combines traditional and contemporary methods,â said Mr. Dai, who unveiled the work last week at the Lianzhou International Photo Festival, in the southern province of Guangdong. âThe vibrancy of real life is the source of inspiration for my creativity.â  Mr. Dai said he chose for the piece events that were representative and involved different levels of society. The project took about three years to complete, he said, during which he shot about one terabyte of images and processed almost 10,000 composite layers for the final photo. Most of the costumes and stage props for the nearly 1,000 characters depicted in the tableau he made himself or rented. (He also stepped in to play about 90 of the characters.) The finished work, which is 82 feet long and about 3.5 feet high, contains more than 30 different scenes. Some show common features of Chinese society today: high real estate prices, disgruntled hospital patients and black Audis. Others refer to specific news events, such as an episode in 2009 in which three university students died while trying to save two drowning children. Reports that fishermen on a nearby boat demanded 12,000 renminbi, or almost $2,000, to hand over each studentâs body prompted outrage among many Chinese. Another scene depicts the son of a senior police officer in Hebei Province who tried to flee the scene of a fatal car crash in 2010 and evade responsibility by shouting to an angry crowd: âSue me if you dare. My father is Li Gang!â âEvery era will encounter new societal and cultural problems,â Mr. Dai said. âI hope that by tapping into reality, the work can provoke thought within a new context, and play a role in the progress of society.â âAlong the River During the Qingming Festival,â attributed to the artist Zhang Zeduan, is arguably Chinaâs most famous scroll painting, known for its detailed, multilayered depiction of everyday life in the flourishing 12th-century Chinese capital of Bianjing, now called Kaifeng. Mr. Dai, who is based in Tianjin and Beijing, said he felt a certain attachment to the painting after attempting to copy it while studying Chinese traditional painting at university. Earlier works by Mr. Dai include a satirical series of photographs called âThe New Lei Feng Stories,â which reimagines the Peopleâs Liberation Army hero performing fabled good works in the context of contemporary Chinese society. Mr. Daiâs work will be on display at the Lianzhou International Photo Festival through Dec. 22. The annual festival, which was founded in partnership with the Lianzhou municipal government in 2005, has become an important platform for Chinese and international photography. âContemporary photography often contains a critique,â Duan Yuting, the art director of the festival, said. âArtists want not only to offer a simple representation of society or certain phenomena, but also to encourage people to understand contemporary problems,â Ms. Duan added, citing Mr. Daiâs work as an example.

Inside, some 60 people fill the small community centre with a clammy heat. But it is not just warmth they are after. They have come for poetry. For several hours, old ladies, moustached students and intellectuals share their latest compositions. With the guttural grace of Sôrani Kurdish, they evoke the smell of the homeland, its ragged mountaintops, and the wanderings of the lone peshmerga fighter. People hold their breath as friends approach their last lines. Poetry is alive in Iranian Kurdistan. New statues of old literary masters arise on busy roundabouts, melodious verses echo from crackling radios and youngsters haggle over the latest slim volumes on crowded street markets. “It’s a form of resistance to us,” explains one attendee. “But it has to be ambiguous, in the way poetry can be. When I write about Kurdistan, I make sure the images I use can just as well refer to a woman. That way I don’t get into trouble, I just say it’s all about love.” Others tread the line between art and activism less carefully. As the meeting progresses, concerned parents condemn the ‘brainwashing’ of their children in Farsi-only schools, an old woman reads out her poem on soldiers burning children’s toys, and a few youngsters call attention to the bravery of their ‘brothers and sisters’ fighting the Islamic State group (Isis) in Syria. Perhaps not everyone realises that a handful of basijis  are sitting at the back. In many ways, the situation of Iranian Kurds is as ambiguous as their poetry meetings. Estimates vary as to their numbers, but at up to 8 million, Iran’s Kurdish population is second in size only to the Kurds in Turkey and probably larger than the Iraqi and Syrian Kurdish populations combined. But while Kurdistan at large is in turmoil and stands at the centre of attention, Iran’s Kurds seem to bathe in silence. Underneath the surface, frustration is simmering. Hoping to improve their plight, 71% of voters in Kurdistan province – which is smaller than Iran’s mainly Kurdish areas – opted for Hassan Rouhani during the 2013 presidential election, comfortably above his Iran-wide tally of 51%. On the eve of yet another election and nearly three years of disappointments later, however, the Kurds face the question not just of who to vote for but of whether they will ever be included in any type of reform. Abbas Vali, professor of modern social and political theory at the department of sociology, Bogaziçi University, Istanbul, and author of several books on the Iranian Kurds, says the Kurds’ “suffering” in Iran is different to elsewhere: “We are talking about entirely different histories. In Turkey, for instance, the modernising discourse of Kemalism has long marked the Kurds as the essential opposite of ‘civilised’ Turks. But in Iran , Kurds were never really seen as outsiders. Rather, they were portrayed as ‘pure’ Persians, a brave mountain people defending the homeland.” For Vali, the marginalisation of Iran’s Kurds stems from quite recent political decisions and has two dimensions. The first is religious. “It’s ironic. The Islamic Republic has recently condemned Saudi Arabia for its sectarianism, but in reality it is doing very much the same thing to its own people. It has been successful in institutionalising religious discrimination against Sunnis and other religious minorities...Sunni institutions throughout Kurdistan operate under harsh conditions.” Second, Iranian Kurdistan is treated as a security zone. This was most obvious during the Iran-Iraq war, when the Kurds were squeezed between Saddam’s chemical attacks and Iranian counteroffensives. But, says Vali, the logic of military rule has never disappeared. “It’s something engraved in the mindset of government officials: when they smell trouble, they first turn to the Kurds. This became very clear during the ‘green movement’ protests in 2009. Even though Kurdistan didn’t take part in the protests anywhere near as much as other regions, it still saw the largest number of executions.” According to a 2008 Amnesty International report , a variety of abuses faced by Iranian Kurds rose under the presidency of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Sunnis were excluded from employment and education, the Kurdish language and clothing became targets of policing, and the numbers of Kurdish political prisoners rose. One notorious case was Farzad Kamangar, a teacher whose shocking letter from prison was published by Amnesty. “When I said I was Kurdish,” Kamangar wrote, “they would flog me all over my body with a hose-like device…They flogged me to a pulp because of the Kurdish ring tone I had on my mobile phone. They would handcuff me and tie me to a chair and put pressure on my sensitive spots, and they would strip me naked, threatening to violate me sexually.” After a hunger strike and several suicide attempts, Kamangar was executed on 9 May 2010. Under Ahmadinejad, notes Amnesty, the Kurds merited nothing but repression. This changed in 2013 with the election of Rouhani, who promised in his campaign to “remove the stain of discrimination and inequality from the face of the religious and ethnic minorities in Iran”. In a country where these minorities make up half the population – and votes – the language of minority rights can be tactical business. Rouhani’s victory showed this could work, but has he transformed his words into realities? In some respects, the answer is yes. At the University of Kurdistan in Sanandaj, the campus buildings are still clad with the faces of Islamic martyrs, but inside a group of students are debating their own identities. One of them gets out his laptop and shows a promotion video he has made for a conference on Kurdish culture. Slides of famous Kurdish writers and singers interleave with quant villages and mighty mountaintops to the epic tune of what sounds like a Kurdish version of Star Wars’ Imperial March. The students are visibly excited, aware that they are among the pioneers of the newly established faculty for Kurdish language and literature. “For 15 years we fought for this department”, one of them exclaims. “And now, with Rouhani as president, it is finally there.” There are 39 students on the programme, with the number expected to increase to 60 next year. When asked about the contents of the course, they stress its apolitical nature. “We focus only on literature and poetry. That merits study in itself! Kurdish authors use stylistic forms that do not exist in any other language. And there is an enormous folkloric heritage. Did you know that in Iranian Kurdistan alone there are 6000 different folk songs?” Mardin, a former journalist, couldn’t care less. As he chain-smokes behind his desk, his face is set with the grin of someone who has seen it all. “It’s cosmetic. Why do you think they opened this so-called Kurdish faculty? Not to have any actual discussions on things that matter, I can assure you. It’s not a coincidence there’s no history, sociology or politics taught. They just want to control what these students are doing. Literature of course can be a weapon, I’m not against that, but only if you are holding the pen yourself.” According to Mardin, the Iranian Kurds’ main problem is isolation. “People think we are doing fine, simply because we have no one to turn to. There’s no free press in Iran as a whole, let alone in Kurdistan. And we don’t have the powerful international connections that other Kurds do.” In this respect, he argues, the Iranian Kurds are worse off than their cousins elsewhere. “Of course, the Kurds in Turkey find themselves in a terrible situation. But at least they can turn to the media, to international organisations or to civil society. Here, we live in a dictatorship.” Having embraced Sufism after spending a year in prison, Mardin is aware how deep the effects of this go. “Dictatorships operate by isolating their citizens from the world and from each other, to the point that we simply can’t see beyond anything but our own individual survival. We have given up on grand causes.” Not everyone has. Sitting in a local teahouse, Sirwan does not stop smiling. He has spent several years in prison and is a respected figure. People walk up to him to exchange quick handshakes in tribute to his courage. When asked about his permanent smile, he smiles even more. “It used to bother the prison guards, too. They tortured me, but I would always try to keep my head up high. I used to ask them: ‘Who’s the free one here? You, who are paid a couple of tomans to pull my nails out, or me, who can think freely and smile at you despite your cruelty?’” He sips from his tea, and laughs: “It drove them mad”. Having suffered torture under the Rouhani administration, Sirwan is not impressed by its promises. “The largest group of political prisoners is still Kurdish. You should see the prisons, they are like universities. Journalists, professors, activists, students – nearly everyone is there for political reasons. They throw 40 men in a small room with no facilities and submit them to systematic beatings. But the worst are the isolation cells. Months of loneliness, it drives you mad.” Despite such abuses, Sirwan is most worried about more subtle attempts to marginalise the Kurds. “It’s the small things that turn our life into a continuous fight. We can’t teach our language to our children, have no right to publish about our history, and must always be careful not to stand out as a Kurd. For instance, if you have an obviously Kurdish or Sunni name, you will never get into public office. This means that nearly all high officials in Kurdistan are non-Kurdish, and they simply refuse to invest in the region.” Many Kurds says the effects of this are obvious in a shortage of jobs, houses and infrastructure. “It’s outrageous,” says Sirwan. “While the rest of the country is celebrating a nuclear deal and preparing itself for an economic opening, we will remain stuck in poverty.” Sirwan realises these are structural problems that won’t be solved overnight. “It would be wrong to expect too much from the reformists,” he admits. “All this talk about Rouhani is counterproductive. Of course we need to welcome a new rhetoric on minority rights, but it doesn’t end there. We should look at the long term.” Above all, he thinks, this requires reform from below. “There really is a lot going on beneath the surface. Young people especially are organising themselves in ways that no government will be able to contain in the long run.” According to Vali, the real question is what this new generation aims for. Will they claim their rights as Kurds, or fight for the democratisation of Iran as a whole? Since the nuclear deal, he argues, the answer to this question has changed. “For a long time, organisations such as the Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran (KDPI) or the Marxist Komala  [both outlawed parties] did not think it necessary to reform the Islamic Republic. After all, their aim was to get rid of it...But now that Iran is again becoming part of the international community, they realise the Islamic Republic may be here to stay.” To change it, then, one has to work from within. Ethnic politics alone, Vali argues, may not be the most effective in this respect. “Kurdish democratic parties are at their strongest when they build bridges between Kurdish and non-Kurdish groups in society. This is what the successes of the Kurdish HDP in Turkey teach us.” Vali argues that initiatives for similar alliances are unlikely to come from the KDPI or Komala : “After years of exile in Iraq, these parties have lost touch with Iranian society, especially with the younger generation...[who] are looking for a new framework through which to express themselves.” Back in Kurdistan, it is precisely this search that stirs the minds of young people. Sitting on an enormous Persian carpet in a small flat with no furniture, a group of students chat and smoke deep into the night. They are well-read, idealist and political. “Resistance is life!” one of them shouts, using a Kurdish political slogan. Part of it is self-mockery. After all, what options are there really? “Some of my friends are in the Pejak,” he says, referring to the Free Life of Kurdistan Party, which is linked to the Turkey-based PKK (Kurdistan Workers Party) and which has been waging an armed struggle against the Iranian government since 2004. “They keep asking me to join, but I’m not into violence. It’s not my kind of thing.” Asked what is, he fetches his laptop. On it, Selahattin Demirtaş, co-leader of the Kurdish HDP in Turkey, is singing a revolutionary folk song. “What a man! Did you see his speech after the Ankara bombings? How he dares to stand up against the Turkish government? That’s what I call leadership.” The other students huddle around the screen as they flick through endless images: of the de facto autonomous Kurdish region of ‘Rojava’ in Syria , the peaceful campaigners of the HDP in Turkey, and the solidarity marches of Kurdish organisations in European cities. They are clearly longing to break out of their isolation and into the new forms of politics emerging throughout the region. For the moment, however, these realities can only be summoned on a laptop screen. That, or in poetry. In the community centre, the meeting is coming to its end, but most people seem unwilling to leave. As they hang about to enjoy the last moments of their weekly catharsis, the club’s principal suddenly pulls them back into reality: “I forgot to remind you! Please do come to next week’s meeting, but be aware that we are receiving some guests from Tehran.” A resignation takes hold of the room, for people know what this means. There will be no politics, no discussion and no creativity – just silence. Far more than Friday’s elections, it will be the making or breaking of this silence that will shape the future of Iran’s Kurds."
"Our Man in Tehran Answers Your Questions About Iran","Advertisement Supported by By  The New York Times A. I think that, deep down, many Iranians are curious whether the rest of the world is really that different from their own country. People here do travel, often to places such as Turkey and Dubai. Inexpensive travel opportunities have been one of the reasons that Iranians are less isolated than they were 35 years ago. The increase in foreign travel just over the past 15 years has changed Iran as more Iranians become familiar with how people in other countries live. A. Iranians seem to make fun of everything in life, especially their worst setbacks. If they did not have this outlook, I don’t think I would have stayed here as long as I have. Translating humor is always complicated, but Iran, like other places in the world, has a vein of humor that plays on regional stereotypes. People from Isfahan are considered to be stingy, so they are the butt of many jokes, as are the people from the Caspian Sea city of Rasht, where they are known for their liberal ideas. Though Iranians often exhibit a great sense of humor, they are also very concerned with keeping up their “waterface,” or their honor. Jokes are often made behind people’s backs. At the same time, many Iranians here take great pleasure in joking about important public figures. Heidi, you might be surprised to hear that gays and lesbians do not always have to navigate their lives that differently from heterosexual Iranians. Here, everybody seems to keep up different faces in their public and private lives. Former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad once infamously claimed that there are no gays in Iran. But last year the Iranian Parliament issued a report saying that 17 percent of the population is gay. Contrary to what some might think, there is no law here against homosexuality. There is, however, a law against sodomy, which carries the death penalty. It is a very difficult crime to prove. The law requires at least four eyewitnesses who must be pious Muslims and who must also explain what they had been doing to witness such an act. They are required to explain why they didn’t leave the room or why they didn’t cover their eyes or, if they had their hands and feet bound, why they didn’t turn their heads to look away. Transgender Iranians can have sex change operations. Ayatollah Khomeini, the former supreme leader, had said that transgender people are sick and that those people born in the wrong body must be helped. Now, Iran is no easy place for gays, lesbians and transgenders. But any perception in the West that people are hanged regularly on every street corner for their sexuality or gender identity is far from reality. A. When a foreigner visits Iran, many people here would likely try to convince her of all the country has to offer. “Look at our climate,” they might say. “In Iran you can ski in the mountains and swim in the blue Persian Gulf waters on the same day!” “ Visit Isfahan ,” another unofficial Iranian tourism spokesman might say. “It is truly a magnificent city.” Iranians will remind visitors of the many physical splendors of the country then spoil them with their hospitality. There will be food, music, fruits, tea and, at the end of the evening, one’s Iranian hosts will offer you a bed to stay the night only so they might repeat for you the entire ritual the next day. The goal is to make sure visitors leave loving Iran — its culture and its people. This might seem a bit much, but Iranians worry that Westerners often think this place is one big desert where Iranians ride camels to work. Also, Iran can be a lonely country, surrounded in the region by neighbors with different cultures, languages and religions. Iranians have learned that a good way to survive in this hostile region is by being so hospitable that visitors become allies and emissaries. If the hosts can be really convincing, some guests may just stay. After the Mongols invaded Iran in the 13th century, within five generations, they became more Persian than the resident Persians. A.  Jason is a good friend of mine, and I can’t wait to see him freed and reunited with his wife, Yeganeh. When they were arrested last July, I was in the Netherlands. Though it was unclear at the time whether other journalists were also on the radar of judicial authorities here, my editors and I decided that it was better for me to return to Tehran. We can’t worry about things that might happen, just so long as we take the right precautions. This is a topic of frequent conversation between my editors and me. A. Matthew, thanks. That is, of course, a very valid and good question. Journalists who work here for foreign news media companies are not censored. We are not required to show our articles to the Iranian authorities before we publish them. But after an article is published, the authorities or ordinary people might get upset or claim that our stories contain lies or, worse, are part of a campaign by the enemy to achieve this goal or that objective. There are many sensitivities here, and pressures on reporters. Not only is the government extremely careful about how it is portrayed abroad, but ordinary Iranians are also very sensitive to the way the foreign news media reports on their country. A foreign correspondent here must navigate a minefield of sensitive issues because, no matter the concerns, readers of The New York Times rightfully expect objective, verifiable information. Do not forget: Iran is a lonely country where people feel as if they are surrounded by enemies, including the United States. They are as suspicious of a foreign reporter as some Americans would be suspicious of an Iranian reporter in the United States. In fact, journalists working for Iranian state television at the United Nations in New York are not allowed to travel beyond a 20 mile radius of the city. Here, I need a permit every time I want to leave the capital. Tourists, however, can travel the country freely. A. The Internet is changing Iran as it has changed the world. Even the clerics here are online , and Iranian politicians have active Twitter and Facebook profiles, despite the fact that those social networks are among many websites that are officially blocked here. Still, Iranians are avid users of Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, which are hugely popular here. People circumvent official firewalls by using illegal software that is widely available for purchase from Iranian websites that are not blocked. There are several tech companies in Iran, and there is even a local Amazon. A large part of the public debate here takes place online. Iran is not as closed off as, say, North Korea. A. Iran, like Japan, is one of the oldest countries in the world. And Persian, or “Farsi,” is an old and rich language, providing dozens of different options for writers trying to say the same thing. There have been many great writers and poets, books and verse, produced throughout history. “The Shahnameh,” or the Book of Kings, tells the legendary history of Iran . More recently, the war with Iraq in the 1980s inspired contemporary writers, most of whom focus on death, sacrifice and martyrdom. “Journey to Coordinates 70 Degrees,” by Ahmad Dehghan is one of the most famous works from this period. Also check out Sadegh Hedayat, whose masterpiece, “The Blind Owl,” has been translated into English. A classic is “My Uncle Napoleon” by Iraj Pezeshkzad, also translated into English, and it is notable for its role in propagating the belief in Iran that the British are to blame for all problems in the country. Iranian culture has a rich tradition of poetry. The most famous poet is Rumi, a 13th-century Sufi mystic who is affectionately called Mowlana, or the Master, in Iran. One interesting modern poet is Forough Farrokhzad , who died in a car crash in 1967. She was only 32. A. Young Iranians — and there are many — mostly find their pride in education. The country has a complicated acceptance process for the state universities, which charge no tuition and are free to attend. The screening process, called the concourse (it’s borrowed from the French, spelled and pronounced as “concours” here), is a nail-biting nationwide event in which hundreds of thousands of boys and girls compete to be one of the top 200,000 students to be accepted. They are ranked, with one student earning the celebrated top spot. It’s very competitive. Some candidates are so talented that they do not have to register for the concourse. Maryam Mirzakhani, who became the first woman and the first Iranian honored with the Fields Medal, the most prestigious award in mathematics, was accepted right away. She now lives in California. Education is a way for Iranian students to advance in Iran and abroad, by winning scholarships from foreign universities. Every year, 150,000 highly educated young people leave Iran to pursue their studies elsewhere, often in the United States. There are around four million university students in Iran, with most attending paid universities. A. First, Esther, you should remember a key statistic: more than 70 percent of all Iranians are under 35 years old. That figure shows the tremendous influence that they can wield. These young Iranians, seeing how their parents carried out a revolution, have not always been pleased with the results and therefore many shy away from politics. But there are no legal avenues for groups of people with different ideas to organize themselves outside the dominant political framework of the Islamic Revolution. Now, that doesn’t mean that all of those young people are not already changing this country. In many ways, their desires, their style, their connections to the rest of the world via the Internet and their love for higher education have created an invisible current that is undeniably influencing those in power, even staunch conservatives. Some people here call it a lifestyle movement. There are many rules in Iran, but there is also a great deal of flexibility in how those rules are carried out. It is fairly easy to go on Facebook, even though state censors have blocked that social network. Parties with men and women are not allowed, but the sexes mix often at parties in cities here. Western music is forbidden, but recordings are widely available. Young Iranians have muscled out some space for themselves where, officially, not much is allowed but where, in reality, a lot is possible. Young Iranians and their older leaders are regularly adapting to changing situations. A case in point was the surprise election in 2013 of President Hassan Rouhani, who advocates reconciliation with the West and a more moderate Iranian government — just what many of those young people desire. That the top religious leaders allow him to implement many of his policies, and that his government is engaged in nuclear talks in an effort to get sanctions lifted, shows that members of the ruling class hear the call of young Iranians. Does that mean that Iran will soon become a country that resembles Western nations? No, I don’t think so, nor does it mean that pressures on activists and journalists will ease. But the relative openness does illustrate some sort of dynamism in this society that other countries in the region clearly lack. A. Hi Fahad. It is interesting to get a comment from Saudi Arabia, especially at a time when the governments of Saudi Arabia and Iran are increasingly at odds with each other. An Iranian might say, “Of course our country has influence in the region; Iran is a great power.” You might disagree, but in Iran the perception of its role in the region is very different. For a long time, many ordinary Iranians were upset with their government’s support for Hezbollah in Lebanon, President Bashar al-Assad of Syria and other Shiite groups in the Middle East. They saw such support as a waste of money. But the rise of the Islamic State and the threat the Sunni militants of ISIS pose to Shiites in the Middle East has led many people here, in the only Shiite-dominated country in the region, to change their opinion. Many people here say Saudi Arabia shares the same ideology as the Islamic State, and they suspect Saudi Arabia of partly funding the group. The Saudi-led bombings of Yemen are perceived here as an attempt to regain Saudi influence in that country where, it is also clear that the Houthi rebels receive some sort of support from Iran. In short, Iran is supporting proxies, but its regional rival Saudi Arabia is doing exactly the same thing, Iranians say. A. Thanks, Richard, for these two questions. First, to address again the issue of Saudi Arabia and Iran: Both countries have been vying for power and influence for decades. They are not now at war, at least not directly. But the rivalry has deep, religious, political and cultural roots, and I am merely a humble correspondent so any prophecies of peace would make me look quite ridiculous. The rivalry between the Saudi government and Iran’s leaders is not that different a story than the rivalry inside Iran between the hard-liners and the reformists, the other subject of your questions. The divisions in Iran might appear to be black and white but, in reality, they are different shades of gray. Both factions support the idea of an Islamic republic, its ideology and religious laws. It is the execution of those laws about which they differ. Should Islamic laws be adapted to modern times, or should laws function now as they did during the days of the Prophet Muhammad? Should Islam be dynamic or traditional? Such debates are at the root of the two sides’ differences. Like Republicans and Democrats in the United States, where the two parties have been trading the presidency, and, like in the United States, in Iran there are no radical policy changes when the power shifts from hard-liners to reformists. A. If by secular you mean that Iranians are not religious, I disagree. The majority of people here believes in God, and Iranians are very pleased that Islam is part of their legal system and ingrained in their version of democracy. But there are many different interpretations of how laws here should be implemented, and there is a growing tension between the urban middle-class values upheld by some citizens and the way that conservative social rules are enforced. Iranians can be preoccupied with how they are perceived in the United States and elsewhere. A. That is a very valid question and there really is no clear answer. It all comes down to Iran’s ideology, which is deeply intertwined with its recent history and the official dislike of United States policies. Also, Iran does not recognize the state of Israel. The government here sees Israelis as the illegal occupiers of another country, Palestine. Those Iranian officials negotiating on the government’s behalf with the United States and five other world powers still must adhere to the country’s official positions against American and Israeli policy. The “death to America” slogan may have become a rallying cry for Iranian hard-liners who receive a lot of media exposure during public demonstrations, but it is not as if shopkeepers and pedestrians are shouting this whenever they feel like it. Many people feel it is time to move beyond such slogans. Still, a nuclear deal by the June 30 deadline will not immediately usher in a period of better relations between the United States and Iran because there are a great many ideological differences that will persist and regional competition for influence and power. If you have questions about Iran, you might travel to Shiraz, in the southwest of the country, to visit the man with the little bird. This anonymous fellow and his brightly colored parakeet sit every day on a bench along a tree-lined boulevard across from the Tomb of Hafez, a shrine to the 14th-century Persian poet. The man — or perhaps the bird — is a soothsayer, of sorts. He does not so much as read your fortune as he keeps answers to your important questions safe, until such time as you are ready to ask them. For 2,000 tomans, or about 50 cents, the man will have his bird choose from a box one of dozens of prophetic poems written in Persian script on pastel-colored slips of paper. “The poem will predict your future and has an answer to all your questions, even the political ones,” Thomas Erdbrink, the Tehran bureau chief for The New York Times, explained in the first episode of “Our Man in Tehran,” one of seven videos that explore life in the Islamic Republic. During the series, Mr. Erdbrink introduces us to modern Iranians who want a more open society and religious conservatives who support the ruling ayatollahs . He has candid conversations with people about religion and politics, revenge and forgiveness. “Working as a Western reporter in Iran is complicated,” Mr. Erdbrink said. “But one can do much more than one might expect.” Many of us cannot travel easily to Shiraz to ask our questions of the man and his bird. So we invite you to ask your questions here. What would you like to know about Iran? Watch the videos, above, and submit your questions for Mr. Erdbrink. He is answering select readers’ queries below. Mr. Erdbrink cannot answer all your questions, but perhaps the man with the little bird can help: We will send Persian poems purchased from the man in Shiraz to 30 readers who submit their questions about Iran. A Q. and A. on Sunday about life in Iran that featured answers from the Tehran bureau chief for The New York Times to readers’ questions, including one about whether the government restricts what he can write, referred incorrectly to the rules applied to reporters embedded with the American military during the Iraq war. It was not the case that they had to show their articles to the authorities before they were published. Advertisement"
"Madeleine Albright warns Trump against isolationist posturing on Nato","Former secretary of state tells Guardian she hopes a ‘better informed’ President Trump would alter his stances on military alliances and cultural progress in US  Thu 10 Nov 2016 12.00 GMT   Last modified on Fri 9 Feb 2018 19.02 GMT   Former US secretary of state Madeleine Albright has warned Donald Trump against American isolationism, telling him after his stunning presidential election victory that national security “cannot be a zero-sum activity” and the US must play its part in the Nato alliance. “Nato is obviously key. We are responsible for each other, a two-way street,” Albright told the Guardian in an interview on Wednesday. Trump alarmed many in July when, at the Republican national convention where he accepted his party’s nomination, he implied that the US might not protect other members of Nato if they were not contributing enough to the military costs, and hinted he could withdraw US forces from around the world. A cornerstone of the intergovernmental North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s strength, and global security, is the pact that an attack on one member is an attack on all. Speaking the morning after the Republican nominee’s shock win and at the moment an emotional Clinton was conceding “painful” defeat for the Democrats and her bid to be America’s first female president, Albright predicted Clinton will never run for the White House again, but hoped another woman soon would. “There are a lot of women in the system and I hope a woman will run again,” she said. Albright, who campaigned vigorously for Clinton, also spoke of her fears that Trump would put decades of cultural progress towards greater equality in American society into reverse. In a dig at his inexperience in public service, Albright said: “It is my hope that once he is better informed he will have a different view … We have to make clear that our national security policy cannot be a zero-sum activity. It has to be win-win and compromises are necessary.” She warned of the dangers of isolationism, urging the vital importance of deftly managing America’s relationships with Russia and China and adhering to the 2015 multilateral Iran nuclear deal . “The US must be involved abroad. If we are not engaged, then the system doesn’t work at all, or, even, a new system cannot be created,” she said. President Bill Clinton appointed Albright as US ambassador to the United Nations in 1993, then as the country’s first female secretary of state in 1997. When Hillary Clinton was subsequently considering an offer to become secretary of state in Barack Obama’s new administration in 2009, she called Albright for advice. “I told her she would do a great job. She was a remarkable secretary of state and she would have been a remarkable president, better prepared than anybody, ever,” Albright said. She declined to predict when the US might now elect its first female president. Trump ran a notorious campaign during which he denigrated women and bragged of sexual assault, while a string of women accused him of verbally insulting or assailing them. Albright said: “I am very sad about the way women have been treated during this campaign. That’s brought out some things that are very troubling. And I thought that we had moved beyond that.” With that and Trump’s innumerable , sustained racist  slurs , Albright said the country had gone backwards, culturally, “in some ways”. “If the campaign rhetoric is an example, there are things that have gone backwards,” she said, without going into further detail. She predicted a peaceful transfer of power, but wondered obliquely if Trump voters might end up having second thoughts. “I was in England shortly after Brexit [the vote for Britain to leave the European Union] and the people were very surprised at what they had done,” she said."
"Ban Ki-moon: 'World living in an era of unprecedented level of crises'","Julian Borger , diplomatic editor in New York  Sun 21 Sep 2014 16.55 BST   First published on Sun 21 Sep 2014 16.55 BST   More than 140 heads of state and government fly in to New York this week for the United Nations general assembly amid apprehension that international order is unraveling at an accelerating pace, while the world's leaders seem ever less willing or able to deal with the proliferating threats. The UN's humanitarian agencies are in danger of being completely overwhelmed by the multiple crises. Ebola is spreading rapidly across West Africa, swamping rickety national health systems and a thus-far underfunded UN effort to stop its advance. The spread of Islamic State (Isis) extremists in the Middle East, feeding on the destruction of the Syrian civil war and exposing the weakness of the Iraqi state, has similarly outpaced patchy international efforts at containment. New conflicts have flared while the old ones have burned on in the absence of concerted effort to quench the flames. Much of Gaza lies in ruins and there is no longer even a pretence at regenerating Israel-Palestinian peace talks. Meanwhile, war has returned to the edges of Europe, with the dismemberment of Ukraine. The conflicts in South Sudan and the Central African Republic, which seemed among the world's most pressing concerns at the start of the year, continue to inflict enormous human cost yet are likely to draw scant attention at the world's talking shop this week, distracted by so many fresh disasters. Ban summed up the mood of foreboding hanging over the UN headquarters in midtown Manhattan, saying the world was "living in an era of unprecedented level of crises." The degree of deadlock among the traditional world powers is probably not unprecedented given the poor record of statesmanship displayed over the decades at the United Nations, but the zero-sum atmosphere in relations between Russia and the West is at a nadir not witnessed since the Cold War. Russia's annexation of Crimea represented a direct challenge by a permanent member of the security council to core UN principles underpinning international security. And the bitterness surrounding Ukraine, compounding already deep divisions over Syria, has seeped into security council discussions on a host of other issues. "The UN is grappling with crises on every level and Ukraine is poisoning the organisation from the head down," said Richard Gowan, at the Center on International Cooperation at New York University. "It does feel like a particularly dreadful year." The one exception to the confrontational climate at the security council this year has been its deliberations on fighting the Ebola virus. Before the leaders even arrived, the council made history at ambassadorial level on Thursday, passing a resolution declaring Ebola a threat to international peace and security, calling on countries to send medical workers and supplies to combat it. The UN established an emergency mission to contain the spread of the disease in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. Ban will chair a further summit meeting on implementing the resolution this week. "Ebola represents an opportunity for the UN in a way," Gowan said. "It is one of those crises in which there are no conflicting interests. There is no pro-Ebola faction. And dealing with it involves using all parts of the UN system. It's a classic international problem requiring a common response." Ban is seeking a similarly common response to another longstanding and growing international challenge – climate change, but with significantly less success. The general debate is starting a day later than usual this year, on Wednesday, so that the world's leaders can attend a global summit on the issue on Tuesday. But the leaders of the world's three biggest countries, Russia India and China, will not be attending, claiming other commitments. The actor Leonardo di Caprio, named the latest UN "messenger for peace" on climate change, will address the Tuesday summit, but his star power is unlikely to make up the gaping hole in international commitment on the issue. On Syria, the task of building a political and military coalition against the extremist group has been done outside the framework of the UN. A security council meeting will not address the role in the conflict of the Assad regime in Damascus, which – despite Isis's brutality – is still responsible for far more civilian deaths, according to Human Rights Watch. On Wednesday afternoon, Barack Obama will chair a security council summit session on Syria, but it will address only the Isis threat and common ways of stopping the flow of foreign fighters to the conflict, on which there is at least agreement in the council on principle. But the task of building a political and military coalition against the extremist group has been done outside the framework of the UN. The council meeting will not address the role in the conflict of the Assad regime in Damascus, which – despite Isis's brutality – is still responsible for far more civilian deaths, according to Human Rights Watch. Despite the regime's continuing use of barrel bombs and air strikes against residential areas, Russia remains a staunch ally of Assad inside the council, blocking any punitive measures. The one chink of light on the international scene atfrom last year's general assembly also seems less bright 12 months on. The last minute mobile phone conversation in 2013 between President Barack Obama and his Iranian counterpart, Hassan Rouhani, as the latter drove to the airport, boosted hopes of a historic thaw in relations between the two countries. It helped create conditions for a breakthrough interim deal in November on Iran's nuclear programme, freezing it in place and partly reversing some elements in return for a slight relaxation in western sanctions. However, progress towards a more comprehensive agreement has been faltering. International talks due to conclude in July have been given a six-month extension, but optimism around the negotiations is fading. "Even optimists recognise that the prospects are dimming for a comprehensive nuclear deal between Iran and the West," Trita Parsi, the head of the National Iranian American Council, warned in a commentary for Foreign Policy magazine. "Rouhani's conservative opponents fear that a nuclear deal will pave the way for a major shift in Iran's foreign-policy orientation and further push the conservatives away from Iran's centres of power," Parsi argued. He added: "Simply put, Iran can afford to say no to a deal that doesn't meet its bottom line requirements.""
"MPs severely criticise DWP for withholding information on 'very bad' universal credit - Politics live","Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happen  Mon 16 Oct 2017 17.37 BST    First published on Mon 16 Oct 2017 09.26 BST      5.37pm BST  17:37   Let us be clear, the deal is working. What could today have been another North Korean crisis in the heart of the Middle East has instead been one problem that that region doesn’t have to worry about. So for Donald Trump to jeopardise that deal, for him to move the goalposts by linking it to important but utterly extraneous issues around Iran’s wider activities in the region, for him to play these games is reckless, mindless and downright dangerous. It makes a reality of Hillary Clinton’s prophecy that putting Donald Trump into the White House would create a real and present danger to world peace. That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments.   5.11pm BST  17:11   And this is from the ITV’s Robert Peston in Brussels, where a single UK flag is flying alongside EU ones ahead of Theresa May’s visit tonight.

The document to be signed off by EU ministers on the general affairs council tomorrow, ahead of discussion by leaders, now has an extra line insisting on a role for the European court of justice in protecting citizens rights in a withdrawal agreement. It also insists that sufficient progress must be made in all three opening issues - citizens rights, the irish border, and the financial settlement for trade talks to begin. The offer of starting internal scoping of an EU vision of a transition period remains. But Mrs May is set to be disappointed if she is looking for anything more than that. There is insufficient progress on the three opening issues so far, it says.   4.26pm BST  16:26   According to the Sun’s Tom Newton Dunn , Number 10 was a bit more forthcoming at the afternoon lobby briefing. No10: no fresh Brexit offer ahead of #EUCO . PM "looks forward to the EU reciprocating" to Florence; ie, we're into high stakes brinkmanship.   4.24pm BST  16:24   Number 10 has now released the read- out of Theresa May’s call today with the French president, Emmanuel Macron. As usual, it is not very revelatory (even the most brilliant Downing Streetologist would struggle to infer anything new about the Brexit talks from this), but I will pass it on anyway. The prime minister spoke to President Macron of France this afternoon. On Iran, they both expressed their firm commitment to the nuclear deal, and discussed President Trump’s decision last week not to recertify it. They agreed to continue to work closely together to ensure the deal is properly enforced, and to push back on Iran’s destabilising activity in the region, including its ballistic missile programme. They said they would discuss next steps in the margins of the European Council in Brussels later this week. On Brexit, they discussed progress in the negotiations and looked ahead to this week’s council. They also spoke about the strong UK-France relationship, and agreed to continue building on our bilateral partnership in a range of areas.   4.12pm BST  16:12   David Gauke, the work and pensions secretary, is due to give evidence to the Commons work and pensions committee on Wednesday about universal credit. In an unusual move, the committee has issued a blistering press statement 48 hours ahead of his appearance criticising the DWP for not supplying it with information it requested about the benefit. In a statement the committee said: The DWP has failed to respond to the committee’s call for written evidence, or any of the four letters requesting statistics and clarifications of policy sent to the secretary of state over the past six weeks. The department was asked to respond to the questions by last Thursday, so that the committee could go into the session with a full understanding of the current picture of the rollout and the protections in place for vulnerable claimants. Despite all this, the DWP has failed to provide any new information to the inquiry. There are very few statistics in the public domain on universal credit. DWP itself has never published data on the length of waits over the statutory, in-built 6 weeks: news of delays of 10, 12 week or longer in receiving payments was heard in evidence to the committee. In seeking to get an up-to-date impression of the rollout and its effects at local level, thecCommittee has written to the 54 MPs whose constituents will be subject to universal credit full service for the first time in October, asking them to report back information. And this is what Frank Field , the Labour MP who chairs the committee, said in a statement issued on behalf of his colleagues. I don’t know if the DWP is deliberately concealing information about universal credit or is simply incompetent. Either way, it is not good enough. This has obvious echoes in the far greater failure of not paying hungry claimants on time. One letter simply asked if the conference announcement on advance payments was, despite appearances, simply a restatement of existing policy. You’d think they could at least answer that one. We expect another announcement on Wednesday about helping councils left short by universal credit’s failure to account for the cost of emergency temporary accommodation, by “rolling-in” some claimants back onto housing benefit. This is overdue, but does nothing to address the fundamental problem of people being left for weeks without anything to live on. Given everything we have heard, I was surprised that David Gauke opted to proceed with the accelerated rollout. I strongly suspect his decision, together with the failure to tell us anything, reflects a culture at the DWP of those most invested in universal credit not telling anyone, including their ministers, bad news. The overwhelming picture we are getting is that universal credit as currently configured is very bad news. We have heard nothing, to the contrary or otherwise, from those running it. The evidence session with Gauke will take place only hours before MPs debate a Labour opposition day motion on universal credit on Wednesday. The committee took evidence on universal credit in September. Currently the committee has just two Conservative MPs, alongside five Labour ones and one from the SNP, but that is because the Tories were slow selecting MPs for the committee. Another three Tories are joining in time for the session on Wednesday.   3.46pm BST  15:46   Here is Mark Drakeford, the Welsh government’s finance secretary, on the outcome of the JMC meeting today. He welcomes what was agreed, but says the Welsh government is still opposing the EU withdrawal bill. My response following this morning’s JMC (EN) pic.twitter.com/ZOx4QVC5Re   3.31pm BST  15:31   The Cabinet Office has now published the communique agreed after today’s joint ministerial committee meeting. (See 2.28pm and 2.43pm.) London and the devolved administrations have agreed that “common frameworks” will apply in areas like agriculture where powers are currently exercised in Brussels but otherwise devolved. This is how it defines those frameworks. As the UK leaves the European Union, the government of the United Kingdom and the devolved administrations agree to work together to establish common approaches in some areas that are currently governed by EU law, but that are otherwise within areas of competence of the devolved administrations or legislatures. A framework will set out a common UK, or GB, approach and how it will be operated and governed. This may consist of common goals, minimum or maximum standards, harmonisation, limits on action, or mutual recognition, depending on the policy area and the objectives being pursued. Frameworks may be implemented by legislation, by executive action, by memorandums of understanding, or by other means depending on the context in which the framework is intended to operate. The document says that it will the “aim” of all parties to agree common frameworks. Discussions will be either multilateral or bilateral between the UK government and the devolved administrations. It will be the aim of all parties to agree where there is a need for common frameworks and the content of them. But it also says that the frameworks will: lead to a significant increase in decision-making powers for the devolved administrations. The full three-page communique is here (pdf).   3.08pm BST  15:08   Ros Altmann, the Conservative peer, pensions expert and pensions minister between 2015 and 2016, has said it would be a mistake for the Treasury to cut taxes for the young by raising taxes for people who are older and better off. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, is reportedly considering this as a possible budget measure, and David Willetts, the former Tory university minister, backed the idea this morning. (See 9.26am.) But, in a statement, Altmann said there were better ways to help the young. She said: Today’s newspaper reports of potential budget measures to please younger voters seem fraught with danger. The suggestion that older people should be punished to provide more money for the young could harbour potentially lethal political damage. The Tories core voters are older people, it would be rash in the extreme to risk alienating them in the coming budget. The lesson from the election manifesto is that punishing the old is not a sensible way to attract younger voters, but is a recipe for losing support of older generations. Altmann said that age was not always a reliable guide to wealth and that some young people earn huge sums. Favouring one age group will potentially alienate others. For example, specially reduced taxes for 20- or 30-somethings will feel unfair to low paid, just-about-managing families in their 40s or 50s. She also said that, if the government wants to help young people, it should instead look at measures to cut the cost of housing or minimise the impact of student debt.   2.43pm BST  14:43   The Scottish government’s take on the JMC meeting is not quite as upbeat as Damian Green’s. Green said that he had managed to quash claims that the EU withdrawal bill amounts to a “power grab”. (See 2.28pm.) But in a statement Mike Russell, the Scottish government’s Brexit minister, said the description still applied. He said: Today’s joint ministerial committee meeting was a tale of two halves. We have been able to make some progress, including agreeing general principles that should ensure the role of the Scottish parliament in any potential UK or GB wide frameworks. However we remain unable to recommend the Scottish parliament consent to the EU withdrawal bill as currently drafted and will not be able to do so until the power grab is removed from the bill. I have and will continue to press for the amendments suggested by ourselves and the Welsh government to be accepted, removing the power grab and providing a clear solution that respects devolution. When it comes to negotiations between the UK and EU on Brexit, I have made clear that no deal is not an option that the Scottish Government can or ever will support. We know from businesses in Scotland that a hard Brexit will cause serious and long term economic damage and it is crucial we stay in the single market and customs union. The EU withdrawal bill will bring EU law into UK law to ensure continuity when Brexit takes place. That means the UK government will get new powers over matters like agriculture currently exercised by Brussels even though these policy areas are devolved. The Scottish and Welsh government say this amounts to a “power grab”. The UK government says in due course it will devolve some of these powers to Edinburgh, Cardiff or Belfast, but that some rules will be applied at a UK-level so that, for example, farmers still operate in a UK-wide single market. Updated at 4.53pm BST    2.28pm BST  14:28   After the JMC meeting  (see 2.21pm)  Damian Green , the first secretary of state, also claimed that the “very constructive” discussion had put to rest claims that the UK government was using the EU withdrawal bill to take powers back from the devolved administrations. Green said: I think you will see from principles that we have agreed today that talk of a power grab is now behind us. We’ve agreed that obviously there need to be ways in which we preserve the UK single market so we don’t damage businesses in Scotland or Wales or Northern Ireland. But [also] that we fully respect the devolution settlements, that we expect this to end with more powers going to the devolved administrations than they have had under the previous arrangement.   2.21pm BST  14:21   This morning Damian Green , the first secretary of state, chaired a meeting of the joint ministerial committee on Brexit, the body that comprises UK ministers and ministers from the devolved administrations. After it was over, referring to Theresa May’s dinner later with Jean-Claude Juncker , Green said: Obviously the prime minister is keeping in close touch not just with Mr Juncker but with other European leaders because it’s important that we continue dialogue. These are tough negotiations, they are very important negotiations, but the prime minister’s Florence speech set out a constructive way forward, it does seem to have landed well with many European leaders. It’s a question of following up on that so we can have steady progress towards the good Brexit deal that we’re all hoping for.   2.14pm BST  14:14   Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, has urged Theresa May to use her meeting with Jean-Claude Juncker tonight to rule out a “no deal” Brexit. In a statement he said: In the current breakdown there is fault on both sides. The EU27 must accept that there is some link between outstanding issues such as Northern Ireland and trade. But the British government must also accept that its internal disagreements make it impossible to make any headway as they still haven’t told the EU what they actually want from the negotiations. It’s good to see the prime minister finally acting with a bit of urgency. The deadlock must be broken, and we must move on with the negotiations as quickly as possible. There is no doubt that ‘no deal’ would be disastrous, and Theresa May must use her trip to Brussels today to rule it out once and for all.   1.51pm BST  13:51   Daniel Boffey A leaked statement drafted by the president of the European council, Donald Tusk, for agreement by EU leaders, had suggested last week that the EU would promise now to scope between themselves how a transition phase would work now. This would give Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, a mandate to talk trade in December, if sufficient progress is made by then. France and Germany were reluctant even to go that far, however, arguing that while talking between themselves about a transition period was acceptable, the EU should not bind its hands in terms of what it gives to Britain should sufficient progress be made by Christmas. It is understood, however, that Tusk has persuaded the French president Emmanuel Macron and the German chancellor Angela Merkel during phone calls in recent days to stick to his original plan, which will be agreed by EU ministers in Luxembourg on Tuesday and announced by the leaders on Friday. “If we end with the conclusions that Tusk proposed it will be a very nice reward and a fair one – that’s where we are,” the source said. “That is the only scenario I can see.”   1.47pm BST  13:47   Here is my colleague Daniel Boffey , the Guardian’s Brussels bureau chief, on the May/Juncker dinner tonight.

"Iraq crisis: Kerry says US air strikes 'may well be' an option – live","Matthew Weaver in London and  Tom McCarthy and  Raya Jalabi in New York  Mon 16 Jun 2014 23.36 BST    First published on Mon 16 Jun 2014 07.26 BST     11.30pm BST  We're going to wrap up our live blog coverage for the day. Here's a summary of where things stand: •  Isis fighters and allied groups took new territory in northern and western Iraq , including the city of Tal Afar, along a main route into Syria. •  Isis claims that it had killed 1,700 Iraqi soldiers were questioned . But videos of Isis executions of Iraqi security forces stirred outrage. Some diagnosed a broader sectarian conflict to come. • Forces in Iraq engaged Isis and prepared for a larger confrontation. These included the Iraqi army, Kurdish peshmerga, Shia militias, Iranian fighters, volunteers and security forces. • Iranian and US officials discussed the Iraq situation on the sidelines of nuclear talks in Vienna. Both sides ruled out military cooperation, although US secretary of state John Kerry earlier in the day left the option open. • Kerry also said US air strikes in Iraq were an option. President Obama and national security advisors planned to meet Monday evening on Iraq. • An Iraqi army helicopter was reportedly shot down  during clashes with militants west of Baghdad. • Hundreds of thousands of Iraqis were unable to return to their homes after they fled the Isis advance last week. A few of their stories are here and here . Updated at 11.36pm BST  10.55pm BST  Reuters expands its snap report that US and Iranian officials held sideline talks on Iraq at the Vienna talks on Iran's nuclear program: "The disastrous situation in Iraq was discussed today. No specific outcome was achieved," a senior Iranian official told Reuters of the talks on Iraq. "Iran is a great country that can play a key role in restoring stability in Iraq and the region." "Military cooperation was not discussed and is not an option," the senior Iranian official added. "The final decision will be taken by capitals." Updated at 10.58pm BST  10.52pm BST  Guardian US national security editor Spencer Ackerman ( @attackerman ) adds a note on the meeting President Obama has scheduled this evening with his national security team about Iraq. The Associated Press reported that the US is considering sending up to 100 Army Special Forces soldiers in an ostensibly advisory role to bolster the shaky Iraqi security forces. The complication: on Friday, Obama ruled out sending US ground forces back into combat . Here's Spencer: The key word there is combat – which leaves options open to Obama for some small US ground presence. Clarifies Caitlin Hayden, the National Security Council spokeswoman: "The President was very clear that we will not be sending U.S. troops back into combat in Iraq. That remains the case and he has asked his national security team to prepare a range of other options that could help support Iraqi security forces. As you know, already over the past year we have been steadily increasing our security assistance to the Iraqi government, including training inside Iraq by the U.S. Embassy’s Office of Security Cooperation and in Jordan; equipment; and intelligence." Obama has yet to reach a decision on US military force in Iraq. A complicating factor is the legal protections a potential ground force would enjoy after Iraq rejected granted legal immunity in 2011, which prompted the US military withdrawal.

Burns left, guessing for embassy, b4 Obama WH meeting on Iraq options Updated at 10.34pm BST  9.58pm BST  We have a new report on how the White House and Pentagon spent the day retreating from comments early in the day from secretary of state John Kerry that made the US seem open to military cooperation with Iran in the Iraq crisis: The Obama administration signalled for the first time on Monday that it was willing to enter into discussions with Iran over the advance of Islamist insurgents in Iraq, but stressed that any contact between the two adversaries would be informal and rejected an earlier suggestion by secretary of state John Kerry that military collaboration was a possibility. In an indication of how sensitive in Washington any such cooperation would be, officials quickly rowed back from remarks by Kerry, who had declined in an interview to rule out military cooperation with Tehran. But officials later insisted that any contact would be limited to informal discussions that would take place on the margins of nuclear talks in Vienna. [...] [State Department] spokeswoman Jen Psaki said that while there may be discussions about the political situation in Iraq, "We're not talking about co-ordinating any military action with Iran." But the prospect of diplomatic, let alone military, cooperation between Washington and Tehran over the chaos in Iraq represents a dramatic turnaround for the two rival powers, whose relations, frozen for several decades, have only begun to thaw over the past year. Read the full piece here . Updated at 10.06pm BST  9.42pm BST  The violence in Iraq is part of a broader Sunni Arab revolt, fugitive vice president Tarek al-Hashemi, a Sunni critic of Baghdad living in Istanbul, told Reuters on Monday. Hashemi said Sunnis have suffered "injustice" since the fall of Saddam Hussein: "What happened in my country ... is desperate people revolted. Simple as that. Arab Sunni communities over 11 years faced discrimination, injustice, corruption," Hashemi said, rejecting the suggestion that militants from Isis alone were responsible. "We do have about 11 to 12 armed groups, and they are being reactivated now. And we do also have political parties involved, we have ex-army officers, we have tribes, we have independent people in fact," Hashemi said. Hashemi, a Sunni sentenced to death in 2012 after an Iraqi court convicted him of running death squads while vice president, something he denies, has long accused Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki of a witch-hunt against his Sunni opponents. "We have many groups beside ISIS. I am not going to deny that ISIS are existing, that ISIS are not influential. No, they are influential, very strong, could be a vanguard even in the whole operation in Mosul and other provinces, but they are not representing the whole spectrum of the groups," Hashemi said. Ali Khedery, a former adviser to US forces in Iraq, makes a similar point in an anxious Foreign Policy column : It wasn't ISIS alone that conquered a full third of Iraq in the past few days -- it was a full-blown Sunni insurgency consisting of ISIS, Sunni Arab Baath party elements from both Syria and Iraq, and the Iraqi and Syrian Sunni tribes that all joined to cooperate on beating back the Iranians and their proxies in Baghdad and Damascus. Many of these fighters are referring to their campaign as a "revolution." (h/t @RayaJalabi ) Updated at 9.42pm BST  9.24pm BST  Here's a roundup of current news and opinion on Iraq in the Guardian (thanks to @RayaJalabi ). Who are Isis? A Guardian panel of reporters and experts  explains the group's origins and its current funding and tactics. Here's a paragraph from Rania Abouzeid's description of the goals of Isis and its split with al-Qaeda: Although they are now open rivals, ironically all three groups – Jabhat al-Nusra and Zawahiri's al-Qaida on the one hand, and Isis on the other – share the same goals: the creation of an Islamic state in Syria (and Iraq) and the return of the borderless Islamic caliphate, which ended in 1924 after the fall of the Ottoman empire. Over at our datablog, George Arnett and Sylvia Tippman compare Isis' finances with other military spending. Isis reportedly has some $2.38bn in cash and assets, according to digital files seized in a raid last week. Two points of comparison: According to Sipri (the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute), the Iraqi government spent $7.9bn [£4.65bn] on defence in 2013. This was as a 284% increase on the amount spent in 2004. A r eport in October last year by the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments said it cost the US army $2.1m per year for each solider deployed in Afghanistan during 2013. According to the latest Nato figures , there are over 32,000 US troops still there. Meanwhile, Nafeez Ahmed has written an interesting analysis on the Guardian's Earth Insight blog, tying the rise of Isis to the West's "insatiable oil addiction": The meteoric rise of Isis is a predictable consequence of a longstanding US-led geostrategy in the Middle East that has seen tyrants and terrorists as tools to expedite access to regional oil and gas resources. ... If we really wanted to shut down Isis and its ilk for good, we could start by dismantling and disentangling ourselves from the geopolitical and financial infrastructure of oil hegemony that incubates terror. In the current context, bombs promise nothing more than the road to escalation.  9.07pm BST  Dominique Soguel of Middle East Eye has interviewed Iraqis from Mosul displaced by the Isis advance . Among the refugees is Um Zina, a pharmaceutical company employee: We didn’t expect what happened. We woke up in the morning and there was no army, Mosul was taken over by insurgents. Buildings and police stations were on fire. We left. I have girls so I was scared for them because we don’t know how things will play out in this situation. ... Thank God, they received us incredibly well in Kurdistan - they showed great hospitality. ... The rapid fall of these cities defies logic. It was a huge surprise to us. How is it possible that the army and the police fell apart in a matter of hours, while the government stands idly by? It’s not possible, unless there is foul play.

(h/t: @RayaJalabi ) Updated at 9.08pm BST  8.55pm BST  The Associated Press picks up a report that also has appeared on Al-Jazeera of an Iraqi army helicopter shot down during clashes with militants west of Baghdad. The AP sources its report to unnamed Iraqi officials.  8.50pm BST  The Guardian's Martin Chulov ( @martinchulov ) has filed a new dispatch from Baghdad. "A rush of Shia paramilitaries and volunteers to battlelines about 60 miles north of the capital has slowed the Isis advance south and it now seems unlikely that the group could replicate its sweeping victories in Mosul and Tikrit," Martin writes : It remains unclear to whom the Shia irregulars will report when they reach the battlelines. The Iranian-backed Asaib ahl al-Haq has primacy among the paramilitaries and is extremely influential in government circles. "No one is prepared to defy them," said Ammar Hussein, a resident of Karrada. "They get what they want, and they will lead the fightback." Another man, a barber who signed up on Sunday to fight, said he believed that conditions had been fulfilled to fight a jihad, or holy war – which was called for by the highest Shia authority in Iraq, Ayatollah Ali Sistani, last Friday. "Fighting for our dignity, our land and our sect are the three tenets," he said. "But for me, this is a religious calling more than anything else. That is the main reason I am going to fight."

"The goal of the president is to get an update on the thinking of individual members of his team as they've been working over the weekend to prepare some options," Earnest said.  8.20pm BST  Unnamed Iraqi security officials have spoken with AP about what Qassem Suleimani , the commander of Iran's elite Quds Force, is doing in Iraq: The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media, also said that U.S. aircraft have in recent days flown reconnaissance missions over Iraq to gather intelligence on the militants' positions. Soleimani has been inspecting Iraqi defenses and reviewing plans with top commanders and Iranian-backed Iraqi Shiite militias, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the visit. He set up an operations room to coordinate militias. He also visited the holy cities of Najaf and Karbala south of Baghdad, home to the most revered Shiite shrines, and areas west of Baghdad where government forces have faced off with Islamic militants for months. The Islamic State has threatened to march to Baghdad, Karbala and Najaf. Soleimani is one of the most powerful figures in Iran's security establishment. His Quds Force is a secretive branch of Iran's Revolutionary Guard involved in external operations. In the mid-2000s', it organized Shiite militias in a campaign of deadly violence against U.S. troops in Iraq, according to American officials. More recently, it has been involved in helping Syria's President Bashar Assad in his fight against Sunni rebels. The U.S. government was notified in advance of Suleimani's visit, Iraqi officials said.

The idea emerged earlier in the day in remarks by senior administrations officials to reporters. Reuters reports on Earnest's remarks: "Any of those conversations that may occur on the margins are entirely separate from the conversations about Iran's nuclear program," White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters traveling with President Barack Obama. Any conversations with the Iranian regime will not include military coordination," Earnest said. "We're not interested in any effort to coordinate military activities with Iran."  7.36pm BST  A police officer in Baghdad says the Isis encroachment in the north has thrown the interior ministry into a state of "great chaos". Haider Khadier, 36, a father of three, spoke by telephone with the Guardian's Mona Mahmood ( @monamood ). "I have worked as a policeman for the Ministry of Interior for few years... in the past week, my job took a dramatic form and I find myself running in panic between the Iraqi cities day and night," Khadier said. "It ... reveals a great chaos overwhelming the ministry": I was compelled to drive to Samara, Mosul and then Basra in a record time. Yesterday night, I got an order to put on my military uniform and head to Basra again. I really did not not know what was happening. I used to wear civilian clothes to hide my identity as a policeman among people, now I'm commanded like other Ministry of Interior staff to wear the uniform all the time. All the ministry of interior's drivers were directed to transport the military and police recruits to different cities in Iraq to fill the gap for those who have deserted and protect the two holy shrines in Samara. On the way to the city, I had to drive through the route of Ishaqi and Audhaim towns, where most of the ISIS fighters are based. [...] To my surprise, they were hiding in the groves and easily could spot my bus. They fired a barrage of bullets against the bus. Four military recruits were killed immediately. I do not know how I got to Samara with the other military elements and the four bodies. [...] In the morning my colleague took my bus and went to Mosul. At the end of the day, he came back by himself. The bus was hit by the ISIS shells and can't be used any more. The second day I was ordered to go to Mosul myself, but at the last moment I was told to head to Basra to bring some necessary equipment for the ministry. I was kept in Basra for three days, to arrive at 5 pm to Baghdad, but Iwas contacted again at 10 pm to come back to the Ministry. Khadier tells Mona about wartime profiteering on gas: I'm so desperate to get a spare time at least to buy my family a gas tube for cooking. The tubes are available in petrol stations in Baghdad, but some people found it a good chance to make money out of the current crisis. They began to buy 5 - 10 tubes of gas to sell. The petrol station sells the gas tube for 4,000 ID, but these people are selling it for more than 25,000 in other areas. Updated at 7.37pm BST  7.24pm BST  Internet service providers in Iraq have been asked to shut down access to the internet in five provinces, according to a leaked letter on Iraqi Ministry of Communications letterhead. The Guardian's Raya Jalabi ( @RayaJalabi ) reports: The two-page document, dated 15 June and posted to the communication ministry's Facebook page here , asks 10 ISPs to shut off service "completely" in Ninawa, Anbar, Salaheddine, Kirkuk and Diyala provinces, in addition to blocking VPN access across Iraq from the hours of 4pm - 7am as well as blocking access to various social media networks. The move follows the blockage on Friday of most social media networks – including Facebook and Twitter – in an effort to limit dissemination of information and images of Isis executions of Iraqi security forces members, both false and not. An unofficial translation of the document can be found here , via SMEX. The ministry has not confirmed the directive apart from the Facebook post, and it's unclear whether the service providers would need to immediately comply.  7.09pm BST  Iraq has tightened security and deployed extra troops around oil infrastructure and oilfields, a senior Iraqi security official told Reuters : Brigadier Moussa Abdul-Hassan, chief of the South Oil Police, said additional troops have been deployed around oilfields, energy facilities, drilling locations and oil companies' headquarters.

Isis claims that it had killed 1,700 Iraqi soldiers were questioned . But videos of Isis executions of Iraqi security forces stirred outrage. • Significant military force in multiple possible configurations was gathering to oppose Isis, which itself has drawn on the support of friendly local militias. • US secretary of state John Kerry said US air strikes "may well be" an option , while senior US officials said the administration was considering military cooperation with Iran, possibly to be discussed on the sidelines of nuclear talks in Geneva. •  Senior US and Iranian leaders pushed back against the idea of US-Iranian cooperation, however.

Iranian president Hassan Rouhani has suggested Tehran was willing to consider working with the United States. •  A large number of volunteers appeared at Iraqi recruiting centers to oppose Isis in battle. •  The US confirmed that it had sent a second warship, carrying Marines and tilt-rotor aircraft, to the Gulf. It followed the carrier USS George H.W. Bush, which entered the Gulf over the weekend.

Guardian US national security editor Spencer Ackerman ( @attackerman ) submits an example: "There has been no contact, nor are there plans for contact, between DoD and the Iranian military on the security situation in Iraq," said Lt. Cmdr. Bill Speaks, a Pentagon spokesman, referring to the Department of Defense.  5.37pm BST  A number of senior Iranian officials have attempted to downplay prospects of cooperation between Iran and the US over Iraq , Saeed Kamali Dehghan reports (read earlier reports along these lines here ). “The Islamic Republic of Iran has had no negotiations with the Americans over mutual cooperation in Iraq,” the deputy foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, said Monday. Saeed has further: Ali Shamkhani, who heads the powerful supreme national security council of Iran, a position previously held by president Hassan Rouhani, blamed the West for the turmoil in Iraq. “The spread of terrorism and its destructive effects, which are blatantly and covertly supported by certain so-called advocates of peace and security in the world and their regional allies, is a threat to human and moral principles and values,” Shamkhani said. Alaeddin Boroujerdi, an influential MP who is the chairman of the Iranian parliament’s national security and foreign policy commission, echoed Shamkhani. “The US support, arms shipments and military training [of the Takfiri groups] is the root cause of the spread of terrorism and inhumane crimes in the region,” he said. On the other side of the question, the National Iranian American Council (NIAC), a Washington-based group, welcomed potential Iran-US talks over Iraq, Saeed writes: “News that the Obama administration will reach out to Iran over the security situation in Iraq is a welcome and sensible development that could strengthen the US response to the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Shams (ISIS),” NIAC said in a statement. Read that full statement here. Saeed also flags reports that the prime minister of Iraqi Kurdistan, Nechirvan Barzani, had travelled to Tehran on Monday to hold talks with senior Iranian officials on terrorism: A deputy foreign minister said Barzani was in Tehran offering explanations about “ambiguities” regarding the activities of terrorist groups ion Iraqi Kurdistan. #Iran  #Iraq : PM Barzani met with Admiral Ali Shamkhani,GA S Ali Khaminei representative @ z National security council pic.twitter.com/pyEd5PGNKB  5.26pm BST  An organizer of a Baghdad center for conscripts has seen "endless masses of volunteers" to fight Isis, he tells the Guardian's Mona Mahmood ( @monamood ) in a phone interview. Nasir Farhan, a 55-year-old Shia man from eastern Baghdad and a father of six, is in charge of one of Baghdad's volunteering centers – recruitment centers that opened after a call to action by Iraq's top Shia cleric, Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani. "Our volunteering centre opened in Al-Mashtal district, east of Baghdad," Farhan tells Mona : We have been receiving endless masses of volunteers flocking from different parts of Baghdad, pushed by their craving to fight ISIS terrorists and cripple their progress to Baghdad. Farhan said he believed that an extraordinary number of Iraqis, more than a million, had volunteered at centers around the country to fight Isis. The Guardian has not developed an independent estimate of volunteers. Martin Chulov in Baghdad reports "the recruitment centres in Baghdad are literally overflowing with young lads wanting to join up an fight, along sectarian lines." Farhan tells Mona : Other than 10,000 men have volunteered to join the Badr brigade and other Shia Islamic resistance factions in Iraq in their struggle against ISIS barbarian terrorists in Iraq and Syria, despite the gruesome pictures of mass executions committed by these terrorists against the Iraqi military forces in Mosul. These acts can terrify any human being and they did terrify our military forces, but these volunteers are willing to die and sacrifice their lives for their country. As the number of the volunteers is booming, we decided to form committees for national mobilisation to [decide who is fit for] the army, because there are lots of elderly men and youngsters whom we can not send to fight in such a decisive battle. Farhan tells Mona that the centers has circulated forms for volunteers to fill in their details, but "the volunteers are too fervent to fight and it is so difficult to convince them that they need to go home for the time being, at least to protect their neighbourhoods": As we are trying to mobilise these volunteers, we are careful not to construct another army that would be in competition with the formal Iraqi army or could be viewed as a threatening militia for other Iraqi sects, defiantly we do not need to create more chaos than what we have now due to the military forces desertion of their bases. All what we are aiming at is to raise the morale of the Iraqi forces and to combat this vigorous attack by ISIS terrorists against our country. I can confirm that we have received even some Sunni volunteers who wanted to defend their country too. [...] None of these volunteers have been granted any weapons by these volunteering centres but it is the army forces responsibility to train them and supply them with the right arms.

Now they are doing it again as Islamic militants rampage across northern Iraq, but this time few say they ever want to go back to their homes. [...] "I'm not going back," said Lina, who fled Mosul with her family as the militants swept in and came to Alqosh, about 50 kilometers (31 miles) to the north. "Each day we went to bed in fear," the 57-year-old woman said, sitting in a house for displaced people. "In our own houses we knew no rest." Like other Christians who fled here, she spoke on condition she be identified only by her first name for fear for her safety. In leaving, the Christians are emptying out communities that date back to the first centuries of the religion, including Chaldean, Assyrian and Armenian churches. The past week, some 160 Christian families — mosly from Mosul — have fled to Alqosh, mayor Sabri Boutani told The Associated Press, consulting first on the number with his wife by speaking in Chaldean, the ancient language spoken by many residents.

"It would be the height of folly to believe that the Iranian regime can be our partner in managing the deteriorating security situation in Iraq," McCain said. He continued: This is the same Iranian regime that has trained and armed the most dangerous Shia militant groups, that has consistently urged Prime Minister Maliki to pursue a narrow sectarian agenda at the expense of national reconciliation, that supplies the rockets that have been fired at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, that has sponsored acts of terrorism throughout the Middle East and the world, and that continues to use Iraq’s territory and airspace to send weapons and fighters to prop up Bashar al-Assad in Syria." The reality is, U.S. and Iranian interests and goals do not align in Iraq, and greater Iranian intervention would only make the situation dramatically worse. It would inflame sectarian tensions, strengthen the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), drive more Sunnis into ISIS’s ranks, empower the most radical Shia militants, deepen the Iraqi government's dependence on Iran, alienate U.S. allies and partners in the region, and set back the prospects of national reconciliation.

I think we are open to any constructive process here that could minimize the violence, hold Iraq together, the integrity of the country and eliminate the presence of outside terrorist forces that are ripping it apart. I wouldn’t rule out anything that would be constructive to providing real stability, a respect for the (Iraqi) constitution, a respect for the election process, and a respect for the Iraqi people to form a government that represents all of the interests of Iraq -- not one sectarian group over another.  2.37pm BST  More from Kerry via Reuters. ﻿Asked about the possibility of air strikes, Kerry said in an interview with Yahoo! News: "They're not the whole answer, but they may well be one of the options that are important." "When you have people murdering, assassinating in these mass massacres, you have to stop that. And you do what you need to do if you need to try to stop it from the air or otherwise," he added.

Bush - and provides the commander-in-chief additional options to protect American citizens and interests in Iraq, should he choose to use them," Rear Admiral John Kirby said. Kirby said the Mesa Verde has completed its transit through the Strait of Hormuz. It followed the carrier USS George H.W. Bush, which entered the Gulf over the weekend with two warships armed with Tomahawk cruise missiles: the destroyer USS Truxton and the cruiser USS Philippines Sea.

The Sunni-dominated kingdom, whose relations with the Shia-led government of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki have been strained, also warned against foreign meddling in Iraq after jihadist-led Sunni militants took control of vast swathes of territory north of Baghdad. The region's heavyweight, which shares long borders with Iraq expressed its "serious concerns" over developments in its neighbour. The unrest "could not have taken place if it was not for the sectarian and exclusionary policies implemented in Iraq over the past years that threatened its stability and sovereignty," the Saudi government said in a statement. The Saudi statement urged a quick formation of a national consensus government to work to "reinstate security and stability," stressing the need for the "participation of all components of the Iraqi people in determining the future" of the country.  1.48pm BST  US secretary of state John Kerry has confirmed that the US is open to discussions with Iran over the conflict in Iraq. He also said US air strikes in Iraq may be an option for combating Isis insurgents. Reuters reports him telling Yahoo News that US is deeply committed to the intergrity of Iraq, and that the al-Maliki Shia-led government must do a better job of reaching out to sectarian groups.

Updated at 1.52pm BST  1.36pm BST  Iraqi security forces in Tikrit have been ordered to renounce the al-Maliki government after the city was overrun by Isis militants last week, a resident told the Guardian. Amjed Abdullah, a 50-year-old father of five, told  Mona Mahmood that an uneasy calm now exists in the city. The Isis rebels held a meeting with those who have relatives in the army and the police, and the government. They said they had no plans to to punish any Iraqi men as long as they expressed repentance for working for the al-Maliki government. The rebels have set up specific centres for officials to denounce the government. The "repentant" have to submit a copy of their IDs and two photographs to be immune from punishment. The militants said their main goals is to overthrow the Maliki government in Baghdad not to punish the Iraqi people. Dozens of policemen and military forces headed to these centres but soon they came under an air strike by the the government aircraft. One of the centres was a mosque where crowds of recruits were gathering. A few of them were wounded. The rebels who are mainly locals from Tikrit are accompanied by some Arab fighters who are touring the city in cars brandishing flags of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. They have warned against looting in the absence of the military forces. Tribal leaders in the city have held meetings and appointed groups of men to maintain law and order. The rebels have ordered the local commander of the National Security, Jassim Jibara, and the head of the Awakening Councils, Winis Shiwash, to hand themselves in by the end of Monday. If they fail to do so the rebels say they will launch an attack on their suspected hideout. The governor of Tikrit, Ahmed Saleh, has fled to join the Iraqi military command base near the two shrines in the city of Samarra. At the moment Tikrit only has power supplies for a hour per a day, but there is no shortage in fuel. Tikrit university was opened today and salaries were handed to the staff. Updated at 1.56pm BST  1.09pm BST  The Foreign Secretary William Hague has been in telephone talks with his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif to see how the Iranians can play a role in easing the conflict in Iraq, writes Patrick Wintour . Downing Street said there was a role for the countries in the region to bring about co-operation and unity in Iraq. It is understood the British have been pressing the Iranians to persuade the al-Maliki government to adopt a less sectarian approach. Hague is expected to confirm the talks with the Iranians in the Commons statement due to be delivered at 3.30pm today. It is a remarkable sign of the thawing of relations between the West and Iran that the phone contact occurred. It is also an implicit acknowledgement that a settlement in the region is going to be impossible without Iran. Previously the British have resisted a role for Iran at the Geneva peace talks on the future of Syria. Number 10 is openly critical of the way in which the al-Maliki government has rejected pleas from Europe and America to adopt a less sectarian approach to government and the security forces. Meanwhile, US officials have confirmed that the crisis in Iraq may be dicussed on the margins of Monday's nuclear talks in Vienna, Paul Lewis reports. US diplomats in Vienna for nuclear talks with Iran may also discuss the situation in Iraq, on "the margins" of meetings, official confirms. Updated at 1.12pm BST  1.06pm BST  Iran's "first martyr" in the battle against Isis in Iraq has been buried in Tehran, Saeed Kamali Dehghan  reports. He was named as Alireza Moshjari from a special unit of the ground forces of the Islamic republic’s Revolutionary Guards, known as Saberin. Local news agencies published pictures of his funeral ceremony held in Tehran’s Shahid Beheshti mosque which was attended by hundreds of men and women who carried his coffin. Tasnim news agency, which is affiliated to the Revolutionary Guards, said Moshjari was killed due to an accident “in the West of the country” on Friday while being involved in an operation. Iraq is situated in the west of Iran but Tasnim did not clarify whether he was killed in Iraqi soil but a group of conservatives websites said he was “martyred while helping Iraqi Shias in their battle against Takfiri Isis”.  12.56pm BST  The US ship Mesa Verde, carrying 550 Marines, has entered the Gulf to support possible US action to the help the Iraqi government, CNN reports.

Updated at 3.22pm BST  11.57am BST  It is almost impossible to think of a single benign outcome from the US-led invasion of Iraq, according to Simon Jenkins, but rapprochement between the US and Iran could emerge as one silver lining . This crumb of diplomatic comfort is a welcome dash of sanity. Iran is by far the most powerful player in the emerging Sunni-Shia conflict. During America's 2012 presidential election, Republican candidates vied with each other over the number of bombs they wanted to rain down on Tehran in what seemed little more than crude war lust. America's drone operators continue to massacre far more Muslims than any Sunni atrocity. So perhaps realpolitik has at last come to the aid of a respect for the integrity and sovereignty of foreign states. For these blessings we must give thanks.  11.37am BST  The Turkish government has stepped up efforts to free 49 Turkish citizens, including senior diplomats, seized by Isis insurgents in Mosul last Wednesday, writes Constanze Letsch  from Istanbul. According to Turkish media reports, the hostages that include Turkish Consul General in Mosul, Öztürk Yildirim, are being held captive in an undisclosed location in northern Iraq. The government’s Iraq Crisis Desk, established by the foreign ministry last Friday, issued a statement saying that efforts to achieve the release of the kidnapped citizens were being “carried out with great care”. Deputy foreign minister Naci Koru told the Turkish press that the 49 consulate staff were “in good health”. He also dismissed reports that Isis fighters had demanded ransom for the held Turkish citizens. He added that the Turkish foreign ministry had urged Turkish citizens in Iraq to be extremely careful. Kuru said: “At this point Baghdad is a zone of risk. Parts of the city’s environs are under the control of Isis. We are warning citizens to leave at the slightest sign of danger. Baghdad is not in the hands of terrorist organisations, but there is a danger, a risk.” According to the foreign ministry website, 7,000 – 10,000 Turkish citizens are thought to currently reside in Iraq in addition to the 110,000 Turkish citizens that live in the Kurdistan regional government (KRG) region. It said cheap flights were available to Turkish citizens who wished to leave the neighbouring country. In reference to Isis attack on the predominantly Turkmen town of Tel Afar on Sunday night, Turkish prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned of a “sectarian war”. He also urged the press to follow the Mosul hostage crisis silently: “About 100 of our citizens are in the hands of Isis elements”, he said speaking at a rally in the Black Sea town of Trabzon on Sunday. “We want you [the media] to follow these events not with provocations, but without writing, drawing and talking too much about them. These provocations have negative consequences.” The prime minister also announced that his government would hold another urgent meeting after his return to the capital Ankara. “We will decide what further steps will be taken then”, Erdoğan said.  11.21am BST  Britain is only prepared to offer "technical" help to the Iraqi government in its fight against Isis insurgents, according to the defence secretary Philip Hammond. PA reports: Speaking at RAF Odiham in Hampshire, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said the Government was "principally concerned" with averting a humanitarian crisis in Iraq and ensuring stability in the country. Asked whether ruling out British military intervention may encourage Isis, Hammond replied: "No, I don't think so. We are going to give all the support we can to the Iraqi government, technical support and advice. "But the Foreign Secretary has made it clear we don't have any intention of putting British boots on the ground. "This is an Iraqi problem and has to be solved in Iraq. But we'll provide all the assistance we can from a technical standpoint." He added: "We are principally concerned to make sure there is stability in the country, that a legitimately elected government is able to govern the country, and to avert a humanitarian crisis as hundreds of thousands of Iraqis are displaced from their homes." Hammond said blaming a lack of action in Syria for the extremist insurgency in Iraq was "probably a rather simplistic analysis". The 2003 invasion was "certainly one of the factors", he added. "I think the root causes of the problems in Iraq are very complex and deep-rooted," Hammond said. "There are multiple causes of the situation. What's important now is that we persuade the leaders of Iraq to be prepared to compromise, to be prepared to act, to be inclusive so that we get a coming together of the different groups in Iraq in order to save that country's integrity." Updated at 11.21am BST  11.13am BST  Washington needs to accept Tehran as an essential player in containing and rolling back Isis, according to Middle East analysts and specialist Iran watchers Flynt Leverett and Hillary Mann Leverett. Writing in the National Interes t they says:  It is crucial, though, that America engage Iran over Isis politically—not, as some suggest, by U.S. warplanes covering Iranian foot soldiers in Iraq. (Most responsible officials and politicians in Tehran appear too smart to fall for such a “trap,” which would also play into al-Qa’ida’s grand strategy.)  10.48am BST  Iranian officials are due to enter talks on its nuclear programme with world powers, including the US, in Vienna today. There is a widespread expectation that the talks will be used to discuss possible US-Iran cooperation in Iraq. US Deputy Secretary of State William Burns, who held secret nuclear talks with Iran in 2013, was due in Vienna, as was Iraian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, AFP reports. Reuters point out that Iran's president Hassan Rouhani, has not ruled out working with the US against Isis in Iraq. Speaking at a news confernce on Saturday he said:  We can think about it, if we see America starts confonting the terrorist groups in Iraq or elsewhere. Where did Isis come from? Who is funding this terrorist group? We had warned everyone, including the West, about the danger of backing such a terrorist and reckless group.

Security forces insisted they had repelled an assault on Tal Afar, a Shia Turkman-majority town in Nineveh province, but multiple officials and a resident said militants had entered it, with one saying they were in control. "Armed groups managed to take control of Tal Afar," a Nineveh provincial government official told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity. "They clashed with security forces and (tribal fighters), who had to withdraw from the town." Martin Chulov in Baghdad said the fall of Tal Afar was of limited significance. The main battle lines are between Baquba and Baghdad, and to the west of the city around Anbar. The north of the country and the centre has, by and large, been taken by Isis. If they take another town or village in the centre it is not going to change anything. If they are going to advance on Baghdad, that's a different story. But I still don't see that happening. They [Isis] are a classic insurgent group, they are very capable, extremely dangerous. But to storm a city like Baghdad, which would be heavily defended by what remains of Maliki's military and irregulars is a very different matter. Updated at 10.09am BST  9.45am BST  Claims that 1,700 Iraqi troops have been summarily executed by insurgents is of “extremely potent propaganda value” for Isis, but they remains unverified, Martin Chulov in Baghdad points out. In an audio update from the Iraqi capital Martin said it was confirmed that around 80 soldiers had been killed, but the fate of up to 1,900 missing soldiers was unclear.  Images of the killings is having an incendiary effect, he warned. These photos depicting widespread slaughter, and accompanying videos, are genuine, they are galvanising a deeply outraged belligerent Shia community in Baghdad. These are extremely dangerous images in such combustible times, and there are urgent efforts to try and establish what’s happened to the rest of the 1,900 odd Shia soldiers who were captured by Isis last Wednesday. Are they in custody in Tikrit where they were taken? Or have they been killed? If its the latter that it is going to cause an even further rapid deterioration in this situation. On the claim that 1,700 troops have been killed, Martin added: It is not easy to hide 1,700 bodies ... I would have thought there would have been leverage in keeping those prisoners alive, rather than whole sale slaughter which they know is going to send every Shia in the land after them. My suspicion is that they remain alive but in desperate peril. Martin said the fight back against Isis has begun in earnest, but it is battle being motivated by sectarianism rather than nationalism. The recruitment centres in Baghdad are literally over flowing with young lads wanting to join up an fight, along sectarian lines. It doesn’t appear to be nationalistic cause at this point. The orientation towards sect is taking primacy over orientation to being a patriotic Iraqi.  8.49am BST  More on the fall of Tal Afar, from AP. Tal Afar Mayor Abdulal Abdoul said that his town, 260 miles northwest of Baghdad, was taken just before dawn. The town has a population of some 200,000 people, mostly ethnic Shia and Sunni Turkomen. The ethnic mix of Tal Afar raises the grim specter of large-scale atrocities by the Sunni militants, who already claim to have killed hundreds of Shiites in areas they captured last week. Tal Afar residents reached by phone confirmed the town's capture by militants. They spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing for their safety. The fall of Tal Afar comes a week after militants of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant [Isis] captured Iraq's second-largest city, Mosul, and Saddam Hussein's hometown of Tikrit in a lightening offensive.  8.33am BST  William Hague has again ruled out military intervention in Iraq, but he revealed that Britain is considering some form of counter-terrorism operation. The foreign secretary is due to make a statement to the Commons later today. Speaking to the Today programme ahead of the announcement he said: "We might be able to help with counter terrorism ... I don't want to go into the details because that makes it more difficult to operate." He mentioned "counter terrorism expertise" before being interrupted. But Hague added: “Are we looking at a British military intervention? No, we’re not. I can’t be clearer than that.” Hague also insisted he backed the invasion of Iraq, but admitted mistakes were made. "I don’t think the invasion itself was a mistake. I have always thought that many mistakes were made in the aftermath of the invasion," he said. Updated at 8.40am BST  8.18am BST  There are reports that Sunni insurgents have seized control of Tal Afar. BREAKING: Residents and mayor say Sunni militants have captured northern Iraqi town of Tal Afar. Earlier Iraqi officials told AFP that security forces and tribal fighters had repelled a militant assault on Tal Afar. It describes the town as important strategicly as it provides a critical corridor for militants to access Syria. Updated at 8.34am BST  8.09am BST  Like Tony Blair, Paul Bremer the US diplomat who led the occupation authority in Iraq, remains unrepentant about the invasion. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme he said: The big error was leaving too soon. I argued 10 years ago that I thought history would judge not that we stayed too long but that we left too early. I think events of the last few weeks tend towards that view. Bremer also claimed that without the invasion, the US would be facing a nuclear armed Iraq and a continuation of Saddam Hussein's "murderous policy towards the Iraqi people". And Bremer called for a return of some US intelligence forces to Iraq to help repel the advance of Isis. On the possibility of co-operating with Iran, Bremer said: At bottom we do have a shared interest in a stable and united Iraq. If we don't intervene and if the Isis moves around Baghdad into the holy cities, the Iranians would see an opportunity and perhaps even a need to intervene directly. So we may get backed into a situation where we are in effect working with the Iranians. Updated at 8.10am BST  7.43am BST  The Wall Street Journal has more detail on its claim that the US is preparing to discuss some form of joint action in Iraq with its one-time arch foe Iran. It quotes a US defence official saying: This is a case where the enemy of our enemy is still our enemy. Any shared interests in Iraq are limited. The paper adds: The White House's engagement with Iran on Iraq offers both opportunities and risks, said US defence officials and Arab diplomats. Iran, a majority Shiite country, has served as Maliki's closest Mideast ally and has mobilized Tehran's military and religious establishment to support their coreligionists in Iraq in recent days. Iran's elite military unit, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, has an extensive presence inside Iraq, said US officials, and has trained Shiamilitias that have joined the Iraqi army in fighting Isis. US officials say the IRGC trained many of the largest Shia militias going back to the Iraq war and maintain contacts. These include the Mahdi Army, Kata'ib Hezbollah, and Asab Ahl al-Haq. Iran has publicly denied sending forces to fight in Iraq and has said it would give Iran military assistance if Iraq asked. Even some of Obama's harshest critics in Washington voiced support on Sunday for coordinating the US.'s military response in Iraq with Tehran's. They argued that Isis poses a much greater near-term threat to the US's national-security interests than does Iran. "Why did we deal with Stalin? Because he was not as bad as Hitler," Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) said Sunday on CNN. "The Iranians can provide some assets to make sure Baghdad doesn't fall." On Sunday's Iran's president Hassan Rouhani said Tehran is ready to help the Baghdad government. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani says Iran is ready to help the Iraqi government and nation, within the framework of international law, if Baghdad asks for help. The Tehran Times quoted him saying: We, as the Islamic Republic of Iran, are both friends and neighbours of Iraq, and our ties with the Iraqi government are close and cordial. If the Iraqi government asks for our help, we will review [the request], though we have not received such a request so far.  7.25am BST  Welcome to our continuing coverage of the crisis in Iraq. Here's a summary of the latest developments:"
"'Beepocalypse Not': Alec lobbyists abuzz in defense of pesticides amid die-offs","Controversial conservative group says bee deaths have been overhyped and blame poor land management: ‘We’re not in a battle against nature’  Rory Carroll in San Diego  Sat 25 Jul 2015 13.18 BST   Last modified on Wed 14 Feb 2018 17.47 GMT   Barack Obama may be pushing America into an abyss of gay-loving, Iran-hugging, welfare-splurging socialist ruin, but conservatives can console themselves with at least one piece of good news: the “ beepocalypse ” is over. Market forces have helped tame the mysterious plague which wiped out bee colonies over the past decade – a phenomenon more formally known as colony collapse disorder – and the US need no longer fear a future without honey, pollination or food. This was the message delivered to Republican legislators and lobbyists at this week’s annual meeting in San Diego of the American Legislative Exchange Council (Alec), one of the nation’s most controversial and powerful lobbying networks. It was a striking gleam of optimism amid dour fulminations against same-sex marriage, the Iran nuclear deal and Obamacare from keynote speakers such as presidential candidates Scott Walker and Mike Huckabee. “The term ‘beepocalypse’ was hype and focused on the wrong issues,” Angela Logomasini, a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, told the Guardian on Friday before giving an official conference talk titled: “Beepocalypse Not”. “The issue has been way overblown. We’re not in a battle against nature. It’s an agricultural management issue.” This being Alec, where corporations and politicians forge common interests, Logomasini had a pointed conclusion: pesticides are OK. Other factors hurt bees, not pesticides, and so the US should resist pressure to ban them. “The reality,” Logomasini said, “is without these products we can’t produce enough food at low cost.” Companies such as Bayer, Syngenta and Monsanto, in other words, were innocent of colony collapse disorder – also known as “beemaggedon” – and the Obama administration should avoid following the European Union’s “unscientific” crackdown on a class of pesticides called neonicotinoids . “The Europeans jumped the gun. The US hasn’t regulated yet but federal policy is drifting in the wrong direction,” said Logomasini. Tiffany Finck-Haynes, a bee specialist with Friends of the Earth, disagreed. US bees are in bad shape and scientific research increasingly blames neonicotinoids, she said, prompting pesticide makers to wage a public relations campaign to avert action by the Environmental Protection Agency. “They’re worried,” Finck-Haynes. “They’re trying to manufacture doubt and spin the science to downplay the role of pesticides.” A Friends of the Earth report last year titled “ Follow the honey ” accused the industry of mimicking underhand public relations tactics used by tobacco and fossil fuel companies. Both sides agree the stakes are high. Bee pollination of crops has been valued at $20bn in the US and $217bn worldwide. Honeybee pollination benefits about one third of US food production, according to the US Department of Agriculture. Since about 2006 beekeepers have recorded mysterious mass die-offs ranging from 20% to 40% of managed honeybee colonies each winter. A sustained net loss of 30% per year would swiftly lead to no colonies at all. Environmentalists say neonicotinoids, which are used as seed treatments on more than 140 crops, attack bees’ nervous and immune systems and disrupt their navigation, learning, communication, memory and foraging abilities, leaving them vulnerable to disease and pests. The pesticide makers concede problems with hive health exist but say the real culprits are the varroa mite, degraded foraging habitats and poor land management, including the overuse of pesticides. In an increasingly polarised, politicised battle, each side cites scientific studies to support its claims. Honeybees are at no risk of extinction. In the past decade the number of colonies in the US has actually risen, from 2.4m to 2.7m . The explanation: beekeepers are more than replenishing the losses by splitting healthy colonies into two separate colonies, and by simply buying packages of bees which include queens. It is an apparent triumph of market forces. Even so, concern over hive health prompted a recent White House policy framework – the National Strategy to Promote the Health of Honey Bees and Other Pollinators . Few expect it to emulate the EU’s suspension of the three major neonicicotinoids – imidacloprid, clothianidin and thiamethoxam – but it may curb usage. Finck-Haynes said the “Beepocalypse Not” narrative in San Diego, where hundreds of legislators and lobbyists charted conservative policies over three days, reflected the pesticide industry’s public relations fightback. Logomasini’s group, the Competitive Enterprise Institute , is a libertarian thinktank. It does not reveal funding sources but the Koch brothers and fossil fuel companies are believed to be big donors. “They have a stake in conservative policies,” said Finck-Haynes. The Center for Media and Democracy, a watchdog group, said that until recently Bayer, which sells more than $1bn worth of neonicotinoids each year, had a representative on Alec’s corporate board and wished to sow scientific doubt in San Diego. “At this meeting, Alec is denying more than climate change,” a CMD statement said . “It also is apparently denying the mass die-off of bees.” Colin Dunn, a spokesperson for Bayer, said no company representative attended the conference. Bill Meierling, a spokesperson for Alec, was unable to immediately confirm that. The “Beepocalypse Not” session, like other non-plenary talks, was off-limits to media. In a phone interview from Bayer CropScience’s headquarters in North Carolina, Becky Langer, director of the company’s bee care programme, said she had nothing to do with the lobbying fest in California. “I don’t know what Alec is,” she said. Langer said Bayer CropScience had promoted education through a “Bee Care Tour” in 2013 and 2014, which spread the message that there was no bee apocalypse. Neonicotinoids were safe if used correctly, she said, but farmers and ordinary gardeners were not always “reading the label correctly”. Logomasini, speaking in an interview before her official talk, said her approval of pesticides was rooted in scientific evidence. They were “not zero risk” but accounted for just a small part of the bees’ problems and in return provided huge benefits, such as freeing up land for nature rather than agriculture. She said she had intellectual freedom and was not beholden to the Competitive Enterprise Institute’s donors. “I can do what I want,” she said. Independent experts, Logomasini said, had praised her “ Beepocalypse Not ” report, which came out in April. The other speaker at Alec’s closed-door bee session was Todd Myers, the environmental director at the Washington Policy Center, a pro-business think tank in Seattle, and the owner of four hives which do not use pesticides. Multiple factors were killing hives, he said, and pesticides were a minor culprit. The solution to the crisis, said Myers, expressing a core conservative principle, lay with beekeepers, not government."
"Is the world more dangerous now than during the cold war?","Fri 21 Apr 2017 20.30 BST   Last modified on Tue 28 Nov 2017 01.36 GMT   During the cold war, there was a clear narrative: an ideological opposition between the US and the Soviet Union. Moments of great tension were understood as episodes within that narrative. The closest we came to nuclear confrontation was the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, when the two countries seemed on the edge of war. But the crisis itself was finished inside a fortnight, and there was a wider framework to fall back on. The 1963 Partial Test Ban Treaty calmed the waters. Then, in the early 1980s the tough-talking but critically derided , Ronald Reagan was elected US president. He reignited the cold war rhetoric and began escalating the arms race, and there was an assumption – particularly in Europe – that nuclear destruction was creeping closer. But it was still within a recognisable context. That ended with the collapse of communism, and the fall of the Berlin Wall. For a while the world felt a much safer place than it had been. But the cold war was replaced by uncertainty. And now the uncertainty is combined with the unpredictability of Donald Trump. The recent bombing raids in Syria and Afghanistan were isolated moments, without any sense of programme or continuity. Nor does there seem any logic to why North Korea should have suddenly become a pressing issue. Incidents that seem to arrive out of the blue can be much more frightening. We’re probably not on the verge of nuclear war, but it’s destabilising if we can’t make sense of events. The sabre-rattling over Cuba concealed the backstage deal that saw America withdraw nuclear missiles from Turkey and Italy. It took years for that story to emerge. Although it is harder to keep secrets these days, there is no reason to assume that diplomacy is not being conducted in private. If the American and Chinese governments are discussing North Korea behind closed doors, it’s not something we are likely to be told about. Bertrand Russell used to express it in mathematical terms. With two nuclear powers, there was a single conflict to fear. With three powers, three bilateral conflicts become possible. With four, that goes up to six, and so on. The number of potential confrontations rises exponentially. There is a remorseless logic to this. When it was just America and the Soviet Union, things were relatively straightforward. When India and Pakistan got nuclear weapons, it introduced a completely new dimension. The number of nuclear powers is still small but, as Libya and Iran have shown, the desire to acquire the weapons is much wider spread. Times of heightened nuclear tension have proved deeply disruptive on an individual level. Sue Townsend joked about it in The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole: “I keep having nightmares about the bomb,” Mole confessed. “I hope it isn’t dropped before I get my GCE results. I wouldn’t like to die an unqualified virgin.” He was reflecting real life. The most cursory glance at social media will confirm that this is true again today. Global fears are internalised, and this is unlikely to change. On the other hand, the concerns of the nuclear age have proved culturally inspirational, from the Beat writers in the 1950s to The War Game in the 1960s, and Threads, When the Wind Blows and Frankie Goes to Hollywood in the 1980s. Much of David Bowie’s best work relied on the imagery of imminent destruction. Perhaps only the one in the subtitle of one of the most celebrated pieces of nuclear culture, Stanley Kubrick’s 1964 film Dr Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb. Frankly, there’s nothing we can do. All the CND marches and nuclear-free zones and lessons in peace studies – from the 1950s onwards – haven’t changed the reality: nuclear weapons exist and they’re not going to cease to exist. The probability is that there will be nuclear missiles on Earth long after human beings. Yes. Humanity has always had a horrified fascination with annihilation. In the West this used to be – and in some parts of America still is – a conviction that we’re living in the end time predicted by the Bible. Since the 1950s, the shadow of nuclear Armageddon has hung over us instead. Somewhere between narcissism and nightmare is the belief that we are the last generation. But it is still reasonable to ask if the use of nuclear weapons is inevitable. And the answer is: yes, at some point the leader of a nuclear nation will be deranged, despotic or desperate enough to use them, whether deliberately or accidentally."
"The Martyr’s Daughter","Advertisement Supported by Our Man in Tehran — Episode 2 By  Thomas Erdbrink A. Everywhere in the world, when a revolution is fomented, some extremist measures may take place. But not everyone agrees with such actions. Even in Iran there might be some revolutionaries who disagree with those measures. It seems that the people you have encountered belong to this group. It’s worth noting that the ideas of this group are similar to the position toward Iran favored by the U.S. government. As a result, their voice gains traction in that country and in the West in general. To me, it is important that we hear all of the voices of a nation, not just those we like. For example, I think that the voices of Iranians were not presented in the United States during former president Mohammad Khatami’s time in office as much as the voices of Iranians were during Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s tenure. It would be as if we in Iran just think about America as it was during Bush’s time in office and we deny the U.S. voice of Obama’s era. — Najiyeh Allahdad A. I believe in the Islamic Republic. Neither part, Islamic or Republic, is enough to run the country on its own. They are the two wings of this bird to keep it flying. I think that this system can be successful if there is someone who respects both sides. We have not been able to present a very successful example to the world, and we must try to improve everything. Nevertheless, I see no contradiction between the Islamic side and the democratic side of this system. — N.A. A. We have a small N.G.O. We managed to take some steps to protect the freedoms that our girls still enjoy. We want to protect these freedoms and then we will move forward to regain the lost freedoms that are in the framework of the law. For example, in the volleyball story , half of the girls who attended a gathering in front of the Azadi Stadium were from our N.G.O. We are different people with different ideas in this N.G.O. Some of us are journalists, some are members of political parties. But the point is that even we do not follow up things very seriously. I should confess that we are, to some extent, indifferent about what is happening around us. It is true that some of us are afraid of the consequences of any action. However, we should not forget that issues like attending stadiums for volleyball matches is not a highly sensitive case. Issues like espionage truly matter. But to object to banning girls from watching volleyball is not a big deal. The problem starts when some people with suspicious backgrounds join us in some gathering. I am talking about Ghoncheh Ghavami . I am not going to judge her here. We had a simple objection: Why had we been deprived of the right to go to the stadiums? Later, we stepped into a game in which we needed to prove we were not connected to this party or that foreign country. — N.A. A. I think that the law is what separates us from each other. Where I deviate from the law, or the officials deviate from the law, we would get different paths. We do not have biased laws. But we have biased interpretation of the laws. For example, there is nowhere in the law that prohibits women from attending stadiums. — N.A. A. In my opinion, being a martyr is to die for what you truly believe in. This belief can be a great goal that one has defined for himself after thinking about it. A healthy and energetic person who has lots of plans in his life may decide to resist any difficulty and hardship to protect his goal. To me, being killed in such a way is martyrdom. Martyrdom has a holy value in my religion. We do not believe that we have lost our martyrs. We know that they are here, near us. I feel my father’s presence and his positive energy always surrounds my life in different happy and sad moments. — N.A. A. Choosing to wear a chador was in no way mandatory for me. I love my chador. I chose to do so when I turned 9 years old. I felt I was grown up enough to wear the dress that my God likes. I believe that God likes to see me in a chador. Therefore, I wear it. It is like when my husband likes to see me in red, then I wear red. It is explicitly mentioned in the Quran that women must cover their whole body except for their faces and hands and feet. Though it is not mentioned in the Quran what kind of clothes with which we should cover our body, I chose a chador to completely cover my body. However, I do not wear my chador when I am abroad. I may wear a blouse and jeans. The similarity between the dress codes in different religions is interesting to me. Even in Christianity it is better that women cover their hair with a head scarf. — N.A. A. Craig: it is unclear to many people who really makes policy in Iran. My best answer would be that most decisions are made by the Iranian system. The political direction of the country is determined by its ideology. No parties are allowed and elections, including the presidential elections, offer choices, but always choices from a group of vetted candidates who have to prove that they support the idea of an Islamic republic. Since the laws and ideology of this system are based on Islam, religious authorities also play a role, often advisory. But the final word in matters of state is reserved for the supreme leader, who is an Ayatollah appointed for life by a council of 86 elected religious experts. That council, the Assembly of Experts, has the power to replace the supreme leader if they decide he is unfit to rule. Elections are not monitored by outside monitors. — Thomas Erdbrink Date of birth: July 26, 1976 Hometown: Tehran Education: B.A. in graphics from Alzahra University, 1999 Employment: Freelance designer, creating logos for companies Life experience: I got married when I was 20. I have two sons. I have been fortunate in my life to have found a circle of friends and relatives who share my deep passion for helping others. We have formed a small charity group that finds people who need help, and we use our connections to gather help for them. How do you describe yourself? I’m an Iranian Muslim who uses any opportunity to improve her country and who protects her country's reputation in the world. I love life, and I love peace. I feel that what people have lost in this world is spirituality. I’ve devoted my life to trying to find this spirituality for myself first and then to help others enjoy it. Are you active on the Internet? I am on Instagram. I also have WhatsApp and Viber. I am in touch with my friends through these social networks and speak my mind. Also, I get information and news through these networks. What do you hope for the future? I am very hopeful and I believe that religion will play a more important role in people’s lives in the future, and the world will be saved by religion. What are your hobbies? I’m active in charity efforts. Like Superman, I jump to find people who need help. Have you traveled outside of Iran? Where? What did you think? I have traveled to India, China, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Malaysia, the United Arab Emirates, Italy, the United States and Syria. I found some Eastern countries like India and China to be very civilized, but they have not used their civilization to improve their daily lives. On the other hand, I found the Western countries to be detached from their histories and stepping into a new world that has an unclear future. Some Arab countries like Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. seemed too dependent on Western countries and would be nothing without help from the U.S. And a country like Iraq has always been hampered by circumstances throughout its history. Date of birth: Sept. 25, 1991 Hometown: Karaj, in north central Iran Education: Student of mechanical engineering, Karaj University Employment: Student, competitive taekwondo athlete Life experience: I got married to my brother’s friend at an early age, when I was 17. My brother-in-law used to practice taekwondo. I watched taekwondo films, and I liked it. He introduced me to my coach, and I started practicing. I liked it a lot and decided to follow my interest very seriously. How do you describe yourself? I am an adventurous person. I love excitement. I am full of energy and motivation to be successful in my studies and my sport. Are you active on the Internet? I have an Instagram page where I put my sport pictures. What do you hope for the future? I am sure that the future will be great. Not only for me, but also for all Iranian girls who play sports. With little equipment and facilities, we have won all of these achievements and honors. I am sure that if we keep on practicing, we can defeat many of our international rivals. As Iran and world powers including the United States try to reach a deal on nuclear controls in exchange for the lifting of sanctions, Iranians from all walks of life are watching and hoping for a new start. Have you ever traveled outside of Iran? Where? What did you think? I have been to England, Spain, South Korea, Tunisia, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey and Qatar. There are great facilities for young people in these countries, especially for women. I think that Iranian girls are so talented that they have reached the levels they are at now despite all of the shortages here. But I like the Iranian culture. How do you feel when you win and when you lose? Winning or losing, the first thing I say is, “Thank you, God.” I am serious. Then, later, I may start cheering or become grumpy when I lose. What matters most in life? Being a good person is the most important thing. Winning medals does not matter on its own. What matters is to become a good champion, someone that people do not forget. What is your favorite music? I like Morteza Pashaei’s songs . I enjoy listening to sad songs and lyrics. I would also like learn to play the piano. My husband has told me that he will buy me one if I win a gold medal. Does wearing a hijab give you an advantage or disadvantage while practicing your sport? To wear a hijab during a match is difficult. I am not so committed to wearing a hijab, but I can see how women who wear one are pestered far less often by men in society. And I like to step on the winner’s podium wearing a hijab. Follow Thomas Erdbrink on Facebook and Twitter @ThomasErdbrink .

"The man with the toughest job in the world","When Staffan de Mistura became UN special envoy, his past successes brought hope for peace. A year later, with no solution in sight, he faces heavy criticism. Has his innovative diplomacy failed or is it simply mission impossible?  Thu 30 Jul 2015 06.00 BST   Last modified on Sat 14 Apr 2018 19.02 BST   I n July 2014, Staffan de Mistura, a 68-year old Italian-Swedish diplomat, was enjoying a peaceful semi-retirement on the isle of Capri when he received a telephone call from his former boss, the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon , offering him what might be the world’s most difficult job. De Mistura had worked under Ban as the chief of the UN missions to Afghanistan and Iraq, and he was now being asked to take up a role as the UN’s special envoy for Syria – charged with finding a peaceful resolution to one of the bloodiest and most complex wars of our time. De Mistura hesitated. Following a stint as a deputy foreign minister in the Italian government, he had recently become the director of Villa San Michele, a Swedish cultural foundation on Capri, and he was considering setting up a Mediterranean policy thinktank. After 42 years of humanitarian work and 19 overseas missions, largely in conflict zones, he had promised his fiancee and two children (from a previous marriage) a “more normal life”. He also had a political motive for resisting the role. The first two UN special envoys to Syria, the former secretary general Kofi Annan , and the veteran diplomat Lakhdar Brahimi , were colossal statesmen, and yet both had been unable to cease the killing. The UN security council remained deeply divided – with China and Russia backing the government led by Bashar al-Assad, and the US, UK and France broadly supporting a ragged coalition of opposition groups, led by the Syrian National Coalition. Neither the Assad regime nor the fractious opposition demonstrated the slightest willingness to compromise or even negotiate. Both Annan and Brahimi eventually resigned in frustration and disgust. After his successes in Afghanistan and Iraq – where US President Barack Obama had singled him out for praise – De Mistura had to wonder whether there was any good reason to put his reputation on the line for a job that was destined to end in failure: “Mission Impossible”, as one of his closest friends called it. The job of the UN special envoy for Syria is a uniquely onerous one. As the nominal representative of the “international community”, in the form of the UN, the envoy’s fundamental task is to bring warring parties to the negotiating table to begin some sort of conversation. But in the case of Syria , where at least half a dozen nations are involved, that requires the participation of not only the major regional actors – the Saudis, Turkish, Jordanians, Qataris and Iranians – but also various world powers, including Russia, China and the United States. (Because no country in the region is considered to be impartial in the Syrian conflict, the office of the special envoy is now located in Geneva.) As he contemplated Ban’s offer later that night in July, De Mistura could not sleep. “I felt guilty,” he told me when we first met in August. He had done humanitarian work for decades in some of the world’s worst war zones, driven by an impulse he likes to call “constructive outrage”. De Mistura was inclined to say no – but he kept thinking back to Ban’s parting words. “He shared with me, very wisely, the current situation in Syria,” De Mistura told me. “How many dead, how many refugees, the level of horrors.” A few hours later, at 3am, he called Ban and accepted the job. Then he returned to bed to tell his fiancee “She was not surprised,” he said. De Mistura has developed a reputation as an innovative and creative diplomat, with a particularly strong sympathy for the struggles of civilians and refugees. (His own father was left stateless and without a passport after the second world war: “I understood, at 10 years old, the strongest pain for a political refugee is lack of dignity,” De Mistura said.) Colleagues and friends regaled me with tales of his talent for improvisation: how he convinced a commercial airline to fly food into a starving Kabul in 1989; how he had World Food Programme camels carrying vaccines in Sudan painted blue so they could be spotted by helicopters and protected against theft; how he used smugglers to break the siege of Sarajevo and bring meals and blankets to the city’s desperate inhabitants. He talks passionately about how the denial of access to water has been used as a weapon of war, “especially in a hot Syrian summer”. He has also repeatedly confronted Assad over the use of barrel bombs – improvised explosives thrown out of aeroplanes with minimal precision – in civilian areas. But De Mistura’s talents have been of little use in Syria: according to a senior UN official who works with him, the fundamental obstacle to any progress towards negotiations is that none of the warring parties – those fighting on the ground, as well as the regional and world powers conducting a proxy war – has any interest in stopping the conflict. “They both thought they could win, and when mediators have tried to take an impartial stance, they cry foul,” the UN official told me. “The same thing happened with Annan and Brahimi.” Among the greatest difficulties for both De Mistura and his predecessors has been merely sustaining the attention of the rest of the world. Brahimi resigned, he said, “because I was getting nowhere and it was the only way for me to protest the total inattention of the international community and the region to the situation in Syria”. Today, more than a year after resigning, Brahimi told me in Paris, “There are still viable solutions – there is always a solution. But the real question is: Is there enough political will and clout?” If the parties wanted to stop fighting, in other words, they could negotiate a resolution. But they do not want to stop fighting. There are still viable solutions, there is always a solution. The question is: Is there enough political will and clout? De Mistura has tried to pursue a more creative sort of diplomacy – less bound to the rigid UN framework in which Annan and Brahimi preferred to function – in line with his reputation, in the words of one friend, as a man who “loves gimmicks”. Last Sunday, De Mistura arrived in New York after clocking up 26,000 miles of air travel in two weeks, meeting with leaders in Syria, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, China and Iran, in a desperate attempt to put the political process back on track. This week, he briefed the UN security council once again on options for action, which many hope have been opened further by the signing of the US-Iran nuclear deal. The Iranians may be the only force capable of persuading Assad to step aside or negotiate in good faith, but Washington is nervous that aggressive diplomacy might affect the approval of the nuclear deal in Congress later this year. In the meantime, Syria is dying. “He’s trying to explore all options,” said Michael Keating, a friend of 30 years who served as De Mistura’s deputy in Afghanistan. “That’s the way he is.” As the third negotiator to attempt to forge an end to the fighting, De Mistura came into the job with energy and ambition – he once called himself a “chronic optimist” – but it has been a struggle to retain hope. “Over time, it’s become a proxy conflict, where many, including the Syrian government, are ready to fight to the last Syrian in order to force the world to recognise that their position is the right one,” he told me before leaving for the UN earlier this month. “This is the most cynical war I have ever encountered.” De Mistura has now been in the job for a year. Inside, Syria is burning, with Turkey, Iran, Saudi and Qatar hovering on the sidelines waiting to pick its carcass clean; its borders flooded with four million refugees; 230,000 dead, and chlorine attacks and barrel bombs continuing to drop on civilians. It is a grisly war, the worst I have seen after many years of reporting conflict. The main actors – the Syrian government and the opposition Syrian National Coalition, are not ready to stop fighting; nor have they been willing, thus far, to negotiate in good faith. The rise of Isis has created an even greater obstacle to negotiations, allowing Assad to position himself as part of an anti-Isis coalition – and raising the painful fact that many Syrians would rather align themselves with Assad’s regime if the alternative is a violent radical jihadist group. From the beginning, De Mistura knew he was, in a sense, staring into an abyss. When we first met in Brussels, where he lives with his fiancee, a few weeks after he took the job, De Mistura spoke of the catastrophic impact of the war on Syria’s civilians. He referred back to the frustrations he had faced in his own past assignments in Sudan and Bosnia. De Mistura has an aristocratic glamour that is rare in the UN: he speaks seven languages, bows and kisses hands, wears finely cut suits and pince-nez spectacles, and has been known to carry a silver pepper mill on his field postings. He is an attentive listener, and the sincerity of his concern for the Syrian people is evident. But in the past few months, De Mistura has come under attack from all sides for failing to make progress towards ending the war. He has been criticised for not doing enough to engage the Syrian opposition, for failing to make proposed ceasefires stick, for focusing on the political process to the exclusion of reducing violence against civilians, and harshest of all, for staffing his own team with longterm associates – the word “cronyism” is often heard – rather than experts with experience in the region. Kenneth Roth , the director of Human Rights Watch, has accused De Mistura of “not getting the big picture” and chasing quixotic local ceasefire efforts. “The international community has been one-dimensionally focused on peace talks that are going nowhere at the expense of stopping the slaughter of civilians,” Roth told me. “De Mistura is trying to get people who are shooting rifles at one another to stop, but that is not what is killing civilians.” De Mistura’s critics argue, in essence, that he has done even worse at his impossible job than he should have – a difficult accusation to judge. “Whether you’re a good negotiator or a bad negotiator, if the situation is not ripe, there is nothing you can do,” a senior American diplomat told me. “You can take advantage of the situation on the ground, which is how the Bosnian war ended. But if you are the UN, you can’t shape the situation. You can be nimble in responding. But that requires experts so you can understand the dynamics. You should have a plan of great detail in your pocket when the time is ripe.” De Mistura’s critics argue, in essence, that he has done even worse at his impossible job than he should have De Mistura is aware of this. “You can’t shape the situation but you can shake it,” he insisted. “You can come up with initiatives. Even if they are not necessarily the most effective ones.” He takes most of the criticism with equanimity, though he was hurt by a report in the New York Times in May that implied he was a lightweight (“more widely known for his dapper style than for any diplomatic coups”) and reported that he had spent too much time, on an earlier posting in Lebanon, sunbathing rather than peacemaking. (“It was his first family posting,” said his friend Andrew Gilmour, the political director in the secretary general’s office – who has worked with him for 25 years in conflict zones – in De Mistura’s defence.) The accusations of cronyism particularly stung. De Mistura had initially thought it best to hire staff who had served him well in the past – and whose strongest quality was fierce allegiance to him – but this approach may have backfired. “Cronyism is getting someone a job in Geneva or New York,” De Mistura argued – not on the frontline of a war. But the work of his team has come under harsh scrutiny. In March of this year, De Mistura dispatched an insufficiently experienced team to Turkey to meet with Syrian opposition figures. Most of the Syrians refused to attend, and those who did were unimpressed. “It was embarrassing,” said one UN adviser who witnessed the fallout. The report they later issued on the meetings was regarded as weak and insubstantial, and other leaked memos from the office have been ridiculed inside and outside the UN for their poor analysis and lack of intellectual heft. “A team full of cronies is a disaster,” the senior US diplomat said. “You need real experts who can pull out the nuances. You need people who know the dynamics among the groups and within the group.” Mouin Rabbani, an experienced Middle East analyst who served as De Mistura’s political director before resigning earlier this year, argued that the team was composed of “individuals whose qualification is personal loyalty and a record of service to him”. “I am in no way making the claim that the Syria crisis was ripe for a solution and the UN blew it by appointing a special envoy who was out of his depth,” Rabbani continued. “Indeed, his predecessors also failed. But the UN failed Syria and its people by appointing an envoy who lacked the capacity to either exploit or create opportunities, however limited, for conflict mitigation.” But it remains the case, as even De Mistura’s critics acknowledge, that neither side has any appetite for negotiation. In May of this year, he announced a round of one-on-one “low-key” talks with dozens of parties in Geneva in an attempt to find any areas where discussion might move forward – but even that initiative has been troubled by the refusal of many opposition groups to participate, in part due to their displeasure that Iran, the main backer of the Syrian regime, would be among those speaking to De Mistura. The following month, De Mistura went to Damascus to meet with the Syrian government, determined to push Assad once again regarding the use of barrel bombs. As he was waiting for his meetings to begin, bleak news arrived from Aleppo, where heavy shelling near a mosque had killed dozens of people and wounded nearly a hundred, many of them children. This time, the perpetrators were not the Syrian regime but armed opposition forces. After meeting Walid al-Moallem, the Syrian foreign minister – and briefing him on the consultations in Geneva with various Syrian civil society groups in May and June – De Mistura sat with Assad for an hour. He bluntly demanded an explanation for the Syrian president’s decision to continue dropping crude bombs on his own people. What was Assad’s response? “That I cannot discuss,” De Mistura said. But it was clear that the Syrian leader was not happy with the envoy’s forthright approach. A week later, De Mistura was back at his office in Geneva, when news arrived of further barrel bombings by the regime. He issued strong statements rebuking both sides – but knew very well that statements alone cannot do much good. “Sometimes,” De Mistura admitted, looking out over the lake adjacent to his offices, “I feel like a doctor who is trying to keep a patient alive, but only able to relieve the pain.” By the time Kofi Annan, the first UN special envoy, convened talks in Geneva at the end of 2012, the Syrian war had already been raging for more than a year. In the months after peaceful protests against Bashar al-Assad were met with armed force in early 2011, nearly the entire country had become a battlefield. One by one, cities were besieged, provincial areas starved, and in some cases, villages annihilated. By the summer of 2012, only Damascus – still under Assad’s control – remained unscarred by war; civilians in Homs, Aleppo, Hama and other cities were being pummelled, and horrendous abuses of human rights were happening on a daily basis. Thousands of civilians were being slaughtered, and even more were incarcerated and tortured. And the atrocities were not just coming from Assad’s side: as many in the opposition Free Syrian Army grew disillusioned and defected to either Jabhat al-Nusra – the al-Qaida franchise in Syria – or Isis, reports of war crimes abounded. Both sides used rape as a tool of war – in jails and at checkpoints. Massacres in Daraya , near Damascus, in Bayda and Baniyas , in western Syria, and Houla , near Homs, saw hundreds of civilians slaughtered by the Syrian army or regime-backed militias, leaving villages razed and piles of corpses in mass graves. Attempts to reduce the bloodshed began early on: the UN did important work in Houla after the massacre there in May 2012. But as I watched them try to operate in Syria, it became clear how difficult it was to manoeuvre: UN monitors in Damascus were not allowed to leave their own hotels because they were getting shot at; human rights officers working for the UN could not even get into the country, as the regime denied their visa applications. From the start, there were grave frustrations and overt obstructions. I left Damascus in June 2012 to fly to Switzerland to cover the Geneva talks convened by Annan – the first attempt to end the war, which involved representatives of the five permanent members of the UN security council, along with Turkey and three Arab states – but not Iran, Saudi Arabia, Syria, or the Syrian opposition. They laid out the so-called Geneva Communique, which outlined a path for ending the conflict: a ceasefire of all parties; the establishment of a transitional governing body; a constitutional review subject to public approval; and free and fair elections after such a review. The Americans, British and French clearly felt the terms of the communique implied Assad’s exit, while the Russians maintained it would prevent any outside solution being imposed on Syria. But most observers now feel the communique badly needs to be updated, since the central issue has become whether Assad stays or goes. Annan resigned a month after the Geneva talks, to be replaced by Brahimi, who struggled to bring the warring parties together for another conference in early 2014. The so-called “Geneva II” conference (which actually began in Montreaux) was initially viewed as little more than a photo opportunity. The mood was grim and hopeless, and the talks were a shambles. Iran was briefly invited, only to have its invitation revoked by Ban Ki-moon after it refused to support the terms of the Geneva Communique – a move that infuriated the Russians. John Kerry, the US secretary of state, declared in his opening remarks that Assad would have to step down, sparking the fury of the Syrian government. As reporters, myself included, watched from the sidelines, the talks descended into farce. Because the parties would not talk to each other, all communications had to pass through Brahimi. One senior diplomat recalled, with gallows humour, an exchange over the status of opposition prisoners. The rebels asked Brahimi, who passed the question on to the Syrians, and then took their response back to the opposition. “What prisoners?” came the reply from the Syrian regime. “We have no prisoners. We only have terrorists and suicide bombers.” “What about the women and children?” the opposition asked. Brahimi, persisting with the charade, took this question to the Syrians, who replied, “We have no women and children. We only have potential suicide bombers.” The parties could not even agree on how to negotiate; the government demanded that all their priorities be discussed first. The main impasse was the role of Assad himself. The opposition refused to consider a scenario with him; the government refused to see a new Syria without him. The other roadblock was the regime’s definition of terrorism – which included all armed opposition – and therefore all parties with whom they could potentially negotiate. Brahimi, an impressively large and elegant man who had previously negotiated the end of the civil war in Lebanon, looked slumped and diminutive when he came out to face the press in Montreux before the second part of the talks began. Although both sets of talks were seen as useless, De Mistura has not ruled out attempting a third Geneva conference; his “consultations” in Geneva this May were, in a sense, intended to soften up the parties with discussions of their intentions for Syria’s future, and to coax them back to the table one more time. But he may not have a vision for how this might happen – especially while the multiple sides, and their foreign backers, Iran and Saudi Arabia, show no signs of giving in. Meanwhile, Dr Khaled al-Khoja, the president of the opposition Syrian National Coalition, argued that De Mistura’s efforts should be concentrated on protecting civilians rather than high-level political negotiations with little hope of success. “What we are demanding is protection from the air, from the barrel bombs,” he told me. “This is the duty of the international community. We are talking about safe zones, so we can defend ourselves.” At the beginning of the war, one could hire a trusted driver and take the road from Turkey to Aleppo, about an hour through a wasteland of blackened cars, checkpoints, and shells of villages. Aleppo was once the glory of Syria – a Silk Road city that was home to Christians, Sunnis, Shia and Greek Orthodox people. In the early part of this century, the city even became a trendy tourist destination: foreigners bought homes in the old city; there were direct flights from Paris and London. Art collectors and designers, such as Christian Louboutin, a friend of the first lady Asma al-Assad, hosted parties in their elegant homes there. For a brief moment, it looked likely to become the new Marrakesh. But when the war came, Aleppo was hit hard in bitter fighting between the Free Syrian Army and government troops. Soon, there were shortages of petrol, water, bread, electricity, food and medical supplies. Aleppo was once home to Syria’s best cancer hospital; now anyone there with the misfortune to contract a chronic illness is almost certain to die. One freezing December day, I watched an infant slowly die as a team of doctors – all residents, not yet fully fledged physicians – desperately worked to save her. She died because of a respiratory illness, an entirely curable disease, because her parents could not get to the hospital as the bombing was so bad. In the autumn of 2014, early in his tenure, De Mistura came to believe Aleppo could be the key to ending the war. He believed that a ceasefire there would have immense symbolic power, rather like a Syrian Sarajevo. De Mistura believed that a ceasefire in Aleppo would have immense symbolic power, rather like a Syrian Sarajevo He was advised to choose a less difficult place – the city had a fractured opposition, and Isis and government forces were still wreaking havoc – but De Mistura was firm that an iconic image was needed. “It was an opportunity to dramatise the need to protect civilians everywhere else,” he said. His plan was to bring small, local ceasefires to Aleppo neighbourhoods one by one, then link them up and eventually link up other cities and areas. There had been other local truces with some success – in parts of Homs, in Barzah, a neighbourhood in northeastern Damascus, and in Ras-al-Ain, a town on the Turkish border. The idea for a local ceasefire was inspired by a former reporter and analyst, an Arabist named Nir Rosen, who has worked in nearly every conflict zone in the Middle East, and had extensive contacts on both sides of the Syrian conflict – including the on-the-ground experience inside the country that many on de Mistura’s team lacked. Working for a Geneva-based mediation group called Humanitarian Dialogue, Rosen had drafted a paper proposing a series of “freezes” , or local ceasefires, that would halt fighting and allow humanitarian aid to come in, creating safe zones for civilians. If the freezes could be shown to work in Aleppo, they could be extended to other parts of the country. Critics of Rosen’s “freeze” proposal argued that it would result in terms favourable to the regime – but in any case, De Mistura’s proposal, which was drafted by members of his staff and presented to the security council in October 2014, was far less detailed. Some observers sympathetic to the plan argued that a more robust proposal like Rosen’s would have met with better results, but the idea was met with scepticism by the council. Throughout the autumn and early winter, De Mistura’s team tried to reach out to various leaders in the opposition, who shunned them on the grounds that the special envoy’s office was too close to Assad. Brahimi and Annan had faced a similar problem. “The opposition basically did not want the UN to talk to the regime, full stop, because they see themselves as the legitimate leader of the Syrian people,” one UN official told me. “But the UN is obliged to talk to the official Syrian government in Damascus.” In December, De Mistura mentioned the Aleppo freeze proposal publicly before he had discussed it with Assad’s government – who apparently learned of the idea from news reports. When he returned to Damascus in February of this year for talks with Assad and his ministers, they reacted aggressively. “Why are you choosing a place where we are winning?” they asked De Mistura. “You should have at least consulted us.” On that same trip, De Mistura was photographed attending a party in Damascus to celebrate the anniversary of the Iranian revolution – which might not have been an issue, but for the fact that Syrian fighters backed by Iran were maiming and killing nearby in the rebel-held Damascus suburbs. The party picture quickly went viral, after it was tweeted by an influential Syria analyst, though De Mistura still maintains he was obliged to attend. “If any member state has a national day – which it was – and I happened to be there, I have to go,” he told me. De Mistura further infuriated the opposition with an offhand remark at a press conference in Vienna a few days later. After discussing his freeze proposal at the end of a meeting with the Austrian foreign minister, he argued that it could save thousands of lives, but suggested that it would be necessary for the opposition to consider the possibility that Assad would remain in the political framework. The remark, he said later, was intended “to drag Assad into the circle of the solution – implicating him in the beginning of a solution”. It was not meant, he maintained, as a literal endorsement of Assad’s position. Unfortunately, it came on the same day that the regime fired missiles and barrel bombs on Douma, near Damascus, and the suggestion provoked stunned outrage from the Syrian opposition, as well as the Americans and the French, who had insisted from the beginning that the war could only end with Assad’s removal. That was the final straw for the opposition, who declared it would boycott all meetings with De Mistura and his team. The freeze plan limped on until February, when De Mistura appeared before the security council in New York to brief it on the possibility that Assad would agree to halt airstrikes on Aleppo. As he prepared for the briefing, however, all hell was breaking loose in the city: the Syrian government launched a military offensive to encircle the last enclaves of resistance in Aleppo and cut off their supply lines – arguing that since they had not yet fully signed on to any ceasefire, they could continue fighting. De Mistura felt he had been betrayed, and emerged from the briefing in New York looking furious. Meanwhile, back in Geneva, De Mistura’s political director, Mouin Rabbani, had resigned in anger, and was giving blunt interviews accusing the special envoy and his team of incompetence. “It was amateur hour of the most cringeworthy kind, akin to sending a newborn baby into the ring to seize the heavyweight title from Muhammad Ali,” Rabbani told me. “De Mistura quickly lost the trust of the relevant players. Rather than play it straight, he had a tendency to tell those he meets what they want to hear, and worry about the consequences later.” Rabbani’s criticism further damaged morale in an already weak office – and De Mistura seemed to be genuinely unaware of the disharmony surrounding his mission until negative press began to appear this spring. But he has acted quickly to make changes in the months since, hiring a new political director with expertise in constitutional law, and redoubling his efforts to mend relations with Syrian opposition leaders. As Dr Najib Ghadbian, the opposition envoy to the US and UN, told me in New York: “It is true that we were not talking to them, but we are now – we have to work with them.” De Mistura, for his part, still believes it is possible to reach a political solution – before the international community can deal with Isis, he argues, there must be some template for a negotiated end to the conflict. There is no formula for ending a war. History may suggest patterns of possibility, while diplomats have their own creative methods for breaking deadlocks at the negotiating table. But after watching De Mistura for the better part of a year, it is hard to see how anyone could bring the parties close enough for even the most brilliant diplomat to secure an agreement. His desire to end civilian suffering is powerful, but he has no sway over what happens on the ground – where the combatants show no signs of halting the slaughter. The most extraordinary diplomatic negotiation of recent times may have been the talks to end the war in Bosnia – a conflict that the Syrian war is increasingly coming to resemble. The American envoy Richard Holbrooke negotiated a peace over 21 days of talks on an airbase in Dayton, Ohio, after deploying every possible means to force the parties into dialogue – from passing messages on napkins between the antagonists over lunch to forcing his colleagues to stay up all night drinking with the Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic. Like De Mistura, Holbrooke seemed to be facing the impossible – and on the final evening of the talks, faced with what looked like certain failure, he gave all three sides a draft of the statement he planned to issue the next morning, declaring that the negotiations had failed. It was bullying, but brilliant bullying, and it forced the talks to a successful conclusion. De Mistura brightened when I mentioned Holbrooke over dinner one night in Geneva, shortly before he departed again for Damascus in June. “Dayton ended the killing,” he said. “And that is what we are trying to do. End the killing.” But Holbrooke – who represented the most powerful country on Earth rather than the UN – had crucial advantages over De Mistura, not least the fact that the combatants had already agreed to negotiations. It’s not clear that a similar endgame for Syria yet exists. “There is a plan,” De Mistura said with confidence in New York earlier this month. He would not elaborate at the time, but in a briefing to the security council on 29 July, 2015, he proposed a series of “working groups” that would convene the Syrians themselves to discuss four separate subjects – including civilian safety, political issues, and military issues – in the absence of any agreement about a transitional government that might displace Assad. “They can start working right away,” De Mistura told me this week. “We don’t have to wait for the Iran deal to be closed.” The working groups, he continued, will take place in Geneva, chaired by the UN. “We will apply the same principles as during the Geneva consultations, those who refuse to come are welcome to join at any time. If they don’t want to talk to each other face to face, we will put them in separate rooms. We all know that people like Russia, the US and Saudi Arabia are talking to each other. A lot of these discussions are moving in a certain direction. We have to allow these talks to take place. In the mean time, what we do is we keep on pushing.” Other diplomats have their ideas. Jonathan Powell, the veteran mediator who was Tony Blair’s chief of staff at the time of the Good Friday agreement in Northern Ireland, argues that any resolution must involve Iran. The US-Iran nuclear deal “allows a solution to the Assad problem to be much more conceivable,” Powell said, meaning the Iranians would put pressure on Assad to go. “The key is to appeal to the interest of the Iranians.” Carne Ross, the former British diplomat who now advises the Syrian opposition coalition, has a competing vision – a more muscular and less theoretical approach, which would involve no-fly zones to protect civilians, as well as economic sanctions. Ross argues that the conflict has reached such an impasse that no party – least of all Assad – will sign up to any peace deal that actually demands a transition from dictatorship to democracy. “Economic sanctions are what eventually forced Milosevic to come to Dayton in 1995,” Ross said. “I think De Mistura needs to say this to the security council and demand their support for such a threat,” he added. “Peace envoys need to say clearly the tools they need to make peace. Parties don’t stop fighting until they have to.” De Mistura’s greatest concern is that Syria will fall away from the international agenda, as people grow weary of watching the bloodshed and come to believe that this is a forever war, a lost cause. But with each month he struggles to devise new approaches, observers could be forgiven for concluding this may indeed be the case. “It becomes almost embarrassing,” he said. The Aleppo freeze proposal, he argued, at least “kept Aleppo on the agenda – it kept people attentive about the outcome. The biggest danger is for Syria to be put on the back burner.” He remains undaunted by his critics. “The worst criticism is that you are doing nothing,” he said. “It is your own self-criticism. Your own voice.” “If history teaches us one thing,” Richard Holbrooke once noted, “it is that history is unpredictable. There will be other Bosnias in our lives … they will originate in distant and ill-understood places, explode with little warning, and present the rest of the world with difficult choices.” Two decades after that war, the Syrian conflict has presented the world with an even more intractable conflict, and even more difficult choices. The US has set the stage by keeping a distance – an approach that has had deep repercussions. Europe has followed its lead. At present it is not easy to imagine what a peace in Syria might look like. Khaled al-Khoja, the president of the Syrian National Coalition, described to me what he called a “New Syria” in the aftermath of the war. “It will be united under one flag,” he said from his office in Istanbul. “There will be one overarching Syrian identity. But there will also be sub‑identities, collective rights, individual freedoms.” Before that point, of course, the war will have to stop. And then, the Syrian people will have to reckon with the crimes against humanity that have been committed, by all sides, over the past five years. Any chance for reconciliation after this horrific war, therefore, will hinge on how it is brought to an end. In that sense, De Mistura’s task is even more daunting than mere diplomacy: he is tasked with trying to forge forgiveness for the unforgivable. • Follow the Long Read on Twitter: @gdnlongread"
"Hong Kong’s Umbrella Revolution: One Year Later","Read in Chinese | ç¹å»æ¥çæ¬æä¸­æç On Sept. 26, 2014, the Hong Kong police confronted a group of mostly young people who had gathered at a government complex to demand greater citizen input in elections than Beijing would allow. The police arrested dozens of protesters . But rather than curb the demonstrations, the authorities’ decision to use pepper spray and, on Sept. 28, tear gas inspired thousands more people to take to the streets. The campaign became known as the Umbrella Revolution or Umbrella Movement, referring to the shield of choice used to fend off police pepper spray. For weeks after, protesters occupied key intersections on Hong Kong’s roads, provoking widespread debates about their goals and whether such dramatic civil disobedience had any hope of achieving them. At one point thugs attacked a protest encampment in the Mong Kok district, but like the police efforts to remove protesters, the assault only swelled support for them. It was only in December, after numerous standoffs and a succession of court orders demanding that the protesters cede the spaces they held, that the occupation drew to a close. A year later, the people of Hong KongÂ â a former British colony that returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula â are still debating the protests that roiled this city. Here’s a look at what’s changed since the movement and what hasn’t: The key demands of the protesters were for the Chinese government to revise its plan for future elections in Hong Kong and for the city’s chief executive, Leung Chun-ying, to step down. They lost on both counts. Beijing’s plan for the election of the next chief executive in 2017 permitted a direct popular vote, but it would have left nominations in the hands of a 1,200-member pro-establishment committee. Protesters said that framework offered little meaningful improvement over the existing system, in which the committee itself chooses the chief executive. Worse yet, they said, Beijing’s plan would bestow false legitimacy on the elected chief executive and make future changes to the election system unlikely. Pro-democracy lawmakers agreed and defeated the election package in a June vote. That means that the next chief executive will be chosen by the same committee, and the prospect for future changes to election rules is uncertain. Mr. Leung survived the protests, albeit with his popularity battered. He has not ruled out seeking re-election in 2017 to another five-year term. Dire predictions were made about the potential for severe economic harm as a result of the protests. The protest encampments in the areas of Admiralty, Mong Kok and Causeway Bay did cause transportation disruptions, blocking bus and tram routes and slowing car traffic on some roads. Some shops at the protest sites did experience closures and reduced customer traffic; particularly affected were jewelry stores and drugstores in Mong Kok that catered to mainland Chinese tourists. The overall effect on growth and the business environment was muted. The World Bank said last October that Hong Kong was the third-easiest place in the world to do business, and that the protests had not affected key components of that rating, such as transparency, a lack of red tape or evenhanded enforcement. In November, the Hong Kong government lowered its growth forecast for gross domestic product to 2.2 percent from 2.3 percent, citing the impact of the protests. John Tsang, the city’s financial secretary, warned that the growth rate could drop even further because of the unrest. But in February, the government announced that the economy had expanded by 2.3 percent in 2014. The street occupations ended in December with the dismantling of protest camps in Admiralty and Causeway Bay. But the protests did not stop. A separate movement made up of more radical protestersÂ has confrontedÂ people from mainland China flocking to Hong Kong to buy goods. The protestersÂ sayÂ that mainland buyers haveÂ upended Hong KongÂ commerce by driving out shops catering to locals andÂ setting off a boom of storesÂ selling jewelry, pharmaceuticals and infant formula â items that are cheaper in Hong Kong than on the mainland and less likely to be fake. The Occupy movement itself didn’t vanish, either, with tents popping up on sidewalks around the main government compound ahead of the six-month anniversary in March before they were removed in June. And on Sept. 20 a banner that read “I want genuine universal suffrage” â a main slogan of the Occupy protests â appeared at the former sit-in site in Admiralty, before it was removed by the authorities. The Hong Kong authorities called the protests unlawful and hundreds of protesters were arrested during the 11-week confrontation, including more than a hundred in the final clearance of the main encampment in Admiralty. ââ âIn August, student protest leaders were charged for their roles in a gathering that set off the occupation. Alex Chow, a former leader of the Hong Kong Federation of Students, was charged with participating in an unlawful assembly. Nathan Law, the federationâs current leader, was charged with inciting others to join an unlawful assembly. Joshua Wong, co-founder of the activist group Scholarism, was charged with both offenses. Their trials are set for Oct. 30. Three founders of the Occupy Central campaign for universal suffrage in the 2017 election â Benny Tai, a law professor at the University of Hong Kong; Chan Kin-man, a sociology professor at Chinese University of Hong Kong; and Chu Yiu-ming, a Baptist minister â turned themselves in to the police in December. They have not been charged with any offense. Meanwhile, the Hong Kong government has been under pressure to prosecute some of its own. During the third week of the protests, several police officers were filmed beating Ken Tsang , a protester. More than a month later, seven officers involved in the episode were arrested on suspicion of “assault occasioning actual bodily harm.â Almost a year later, they have yet to be formally charged. Mr. Tsang has said he wants to bring his case to the United Nations during a session on torture in November and institute a private prosecution against the police officers. â WHAT NEXT?   Pro-democracy parties and student and civil society groups are planning marches and seminars this weekend outside the main government complex in Admiralty. That will be followed by a 15-minute silent remembrance beginning at 5:58 p.m. Monday, the anniversary of the moment the first tear gas canisters were fired. They say there are no plans to stage another occupation. However, Tam Tak-chi, a member of the firebrand People Power political party, has called for 1,000 supporters to stage an 87-minute occupation nearby. Mr. Wong, the student leader, said in an interview that he had become convinced that civil disobedience such as the street occupations “simply didn’t work.” He said his long-term goal was a referendum on Hong Kong’s political status after 2047, when the “one country, two systems” framework created for the territory’s return to Chinese control will expire. Such a vote, which he said could be held in 2030, could allow Hong Kong residents to express their preference for a continuation of the current system, the adoption of the mainland Chinese political system or independence. As for his own preference, Mr. Wong said, “If Hong Kong can enjoy the promised autonomy and democracy under Chinese rule, we wouldn’t need independence.” He plans to take part in the anniversary events on Monday, where he said he would focus not on the past but on the future of Hong Kong’s democracy movement. “It’s not a commemoration. We didn’t win and there’s nothing to mourn,” Mr. Wong said. “What’s important is that we learn from the past how to better move forward.” Sinosphere, the China blog of The New York Times, delivers intimate, authoritative coverage of the planet's most populous nation and its relationship with the rest of the world.

"Capital, Diplomacy and Carnations","Advertisement Supported by By  Teju Cole A few weeks ago, I stepped into a gallery in Brussels to see an exhibition by the American photographer Taryn Simon. The walls were covered with large color photographs of flower arrangements, 13 in all. Each photograph was framed in wood, and embedded in each frame was a long caption. One began: “Agreement establishing the International Islamic Trade Finance Corporation. Al-Bayan Palace, Kuwait City, Kuwait, May 30, 2006.” Another: “Framework agreement for economic cooperation. Quito, Ecuador, Jan. 12, 2012.” It was these captions that made the arrangements legible, confirming that, far from being merely decorative, the flowers were charged with historical meaning. I saw this new exhibition — which has the intriguing title “Paperwork and the Will of Capital” — in late October, and decided to write an essay about it. When I returned to the United States in early November, I was caught up in the presidential campaign and too distracted to write anything; I figured I’d get to it on Nov. 9. The shock of that morning’s election result was not mine alone. I lay in bed in grief and confusion. I was not merely “sad.” I was derailed. All my work suddenly seemed pointless. It was so difficult for me to organize thoughts into language that I felt as if I’d had a stroke. It wasn’t until late on Nov. 10 that language slowly returned. The return of the ability to write felt like resistance, the reclamation of an insight: Even at the worst of times, there is nothing pointless about the work we do as critics or artists. So I looked at Taryn Simon again. Take, for instance, her photograph of an arrangement of spray rose and lisianthus. The flowers are piled on a chartreuse table or plinth; the wall behind them is the color of raw linen. The caption begins: “Comprehensive claims settlement agreement between Libya and the United States.” What could a flower arrangement have to do with an agreement to settle claims between two nations? “Paperwork and the Will of Capital” originates in the press and official photographs made at signings of agreements, declarations, memorandums, treaties, communiqués, conventions, contracts and other formalized moments of accord. Simon noticed the ubiquity of floral displays at these occasions. To refocus attention on the workings of power at these signings, she took an oblique approach: a re-creation of the flower arrangements. The flowers were originally a decorative note, a reflex to signal the importance of the occasion. Reconstructed, they are not mere decorations. The people are gone. The documents are absent. The isolated arrangements are like secrets that can be parsed only with the help of their captions. The caption to the spray rose and lisianthus continues, with punctilious official language: “United States Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs David Welch and head of U.S. affairs in the Libyan Foreign Ministry Ahmed al-Fatouri signed an agreement settling all outstanding lawsuits to provide compensation for damages claimed by their respective nationals.” The text goes on, offering details about claims made in the 1986 bombing of a Berlin discothèque, the bombing of Tripoli and Benghazi by American forces the same year and the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. The photograph looks innocent (what could be more innocent than flowers?), but the caption is a whirlwind of actions and consequences, of decisions and their political fallout. Similar tensions propelled Simon’s earlier projects. “An American Index of the Hidden and Unfamiliar” (2007) was about secret sites in the United States, from a nuclear-waste facility to a deliberation room for jury simulations. For “Contraband” (2010), Simon spent a working week at John F. Kennedy International Airport, making over a thousand photographs of items that had been seized by customs officials, from dead animals and exotic fruit to a parade of counterfeit pharmaceuticals and luxury items. In the most complex of her projects, “A Living Man Declared Dead and Other Chapters I – XVIII” (2008-11), she used portraits and captions to look at families in several different countries. In each “chapter,” the story was woven around one individual, to whom all the others were related. The project was systematic at the same time that it revealed the impossibility of systematic accounts of human experience: The more detail Simon supplied, the more the observer became aware of how many more details could be piled on. Photojournalists give us images that work by themselves, or seem to. A photograph in a work by Simon is different: It verifies, or purports to verify, the claim made in its caption, rather than the other way around. The photograph is reduced to the status of evidence: It is there to testify to something that is not a photograph, something that predated its making. But matters are not so simple, because this “evidence” is itself carefully made and lushly presented. Simon’s art is ambidextrous, catching us with both its narrative and its technique. If “A Living Man Declared Dead” was about the nature of personal fate, “Paperwork and the Will of Capital” uses a different set of tools to think about political fate. Powerful men (it is usually men) meet to sign some papers. Afterward, the world is not the same. And yet few of those whose lives are altered by whatever was signed could conceivably trace their circumstances to that event. All they know — all most of us know — is that there are powerful forces in the world that shape our day-to-day realities. Simon’s project brings the scattered light of those forces to clear points of attention. Consider another arrangement. Beside an assortment of spray carnation, baby’s breath, cornflower and oxeye daisy is the caption: “Classified ‘Spare Parts’ deal. Oval Office, White House, Washington, D.C., United States, May 16, 1975.” This one is especially opaque, so I read the next paragraph. “United States President Gerald R. Ford, United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and the shah of Iran, Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, held a classified meeting in which they discussed a plan to provide material support to Turkey by funneling supplies through Iran.” A longer paragraph describes how Ford and the shah circumvented the arms embargo Congress imposed on Turkey. Simon’s project evokes 17th-century Dutch still-life paintings in its crisp attention to detail and in the impossibility of the bouquets it presents: flowers that bloom in different seasons, or that would never be found growing in the same terrain. And just like those baroque paintings, “Paperwork and the Will of Capital” is made possible by the global flow of goods and money. God is in the details, it is said. Or just as often: The Devil is in the details. Perhaps we should leave theology out of it and simply say that what is human is in the details. Turkey, Iran, Kissinger, Ford: It all seems so long ago. But we don’t turn to history because it is demonstrably relevant, and we don’t look at art only because it is monumental or beautiful. Taryn Simon’s work happens to be relevant, monumental and beautiful. But the greater consolation in thinking about this work at this moment lies in its details. It is in the deadpan meticulousness it embeds, its unruffled testimony about the highways and byways of history. On those immediate postelection mornings in November when I lay in bed aphasic and estranged from myself, whatever did not address the current predicament seemed unworthy. But what became clear was that “the current predicament” was precisely this condemnation of detail. This erasure of historical nuance can be the anteroom to hopelessness. Sure, clear and direct opposition to bad policies has to be part of the response to the coming years. Marching will be important, and there might be a need to shout slogans. But no less necessary will be our commitment to detail, to meticulousness, to all the accumulated forms of patience that guarantee, rather than merely decorate, our lives.

"Obama Seizes on Missile Launch in Seeking Nuclear Cuts","Advertisement By HELENE COOPER and DAVID E. SANGER APRIL 5, 2009  PRAGUE — Hours after North Korea ’s missile test, President Obama on Sunday called for new United Nations sanctions and laid out a new approach to American nuclear disarmament policy — one intended to strengthen the United States and its allies in halting proliferation. “In a strange turn of history, the threat of global nuclear war has gone down, but the risk of a nuclear attack has gone up,” Mr. Obama told a huge crowd in the square outside of Prague Castle. “Black market trade in nuclear secrets and nuclear materials abound. The technology to build a bomb has spread.” And yet, he said, too few resources have been committed to developing a strategy to stop terrorist groups like Al Qaeda that are “determined to buy, build or steal” a bomb. Mr. Obama said that his administration would “reduce the role of nuclear weapons ” in its national security strategy, and would urge other countries to do the same. He pointed to the agreement he reached last week with President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia to begin negotiations on reducing warheads and stockpiles, and said the two countries would try to reach an agreement by the end of the year. He also promised to aggressively pursue American ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which in the past has faced strong opposition in Congress. Advertisement It is a strategy based on the idea that if the United States shows it is willing to greatly shrink the size of its atomic arsenal, ban nuclear testing and cut off the worldwide production of bomb material, reluctant allies and partners around the world will  be more likely to rewrite nuclear treaties and enforce sanctions against North Korea and Iran . Advertisement In his speech, he said North Korea’s missile test illustrated “the need for action, not just this afternoon at the U.N. Security Council , but in our determination to prevent the spread of these weapons.” “Rules must be binding,” he said. “Violations must be punished. Words must mean something.” Those words were added to the end of a long-planned arms control speech hours before, after the president was awakened at 4:30 a.m. by his press secretary, Robert Gibbs , with news of North Korea’s defiance. The president quickly began talks with senior officials, including Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton , his former rival who offered up the now famous “It’s 3 a.m. and the telephone rings” campaign advertisement that was meant to show that Mr. Obama was not prepared to deal with an international crisis. Mrs. Clinton talked to South Korean, Russian, Chinese and Japanese officials, administration officials said. Mr. Obama, meanwhile, got on the phone with Adm. Mike Mullen , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , and Gen. James E. Cartwright, the vice chairman. He also spoke by phone to Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and huddled with Gen. James L. Jones , his national security adviser, before heading to the square outside of Prague Castle to address the crowd there. Despite his calls for action, it remained unclear exactly what the West would be able to do to  punish North Korea. President George W. Bush pressed for similar sanctions after the North’s nuclear test in October 2006, but they had little long-term effect. At the United Nations Security Council on Sunday, members were at an impasse on whether to condemn the test. The United States and its main allies — Japan , France and Britain — were pushing for a resolution denouncing the launching as a violation of the 2006 sanctions, which demanded that North Korea suspend any activity related to the launching of ballistic missiles. As talks continued after a three-hour emergency session ended inconclusively, diplomats said a main issue would be determining if the failed launching violated any resolutions. Advertisement “We think that what was launched is not the issue; the fact that there was a launch using ballistic missile technology is itself a clear violation,” said Susan E. Rice , the American ambassador. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter. You must select a newsletter to subscribe to. China left its position ambiguous, although diplomats said that at  the initial meeting it stressed that the North Koreans had a right like any other country to launch satellites. “Our position is that all countries concerned should show restraint and refrain from taking actions that might lead to increased tensions,” Yesui Zhang, the Chinese ambassador, told reporters. Igor N. Schcherbak, the Russian envoy, said that his country did not think it was a violation of the previous resolutions banning ballistic missiles, but he left some wriggle room by saying that Russia was studying the matter. In his speech, Mr. Obama said he still planned to continue with missile defense, but he tied the need for such a system to any Iranian acquisition of nuclear weapons. Russia opposes locating a defense shield in Poland and the Czech Republic , as current plans call for, and Mr. Obama has responded by pushing the Russians to stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. Missile defense is a resonant issue in Prague, since the now-collapsed government of Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek went to bat against popular opinion here to support the missile shield, only to have the Obama administration begin backing away from the plan. But Mr. Obama praised the government’s support, saying there was still a need. “Let me be clear: Iran’s nuclear and ballistic missile activity poses a real threat, not just to the United States, but to Iran’s neighbors and our allies,” Mr. Obama said. “The Czech Republic and Poland have been courageous in agreeing to host a defense against these missiles. As long as the threat from Iran persists, we will go forward with a missile defense system that is cost-effective and proven.” Despite his categorization of Iran and North Korea as threats, the new nuclear strategy as laid out in his speech sidestepped the question of exactly how to handle them, or the risk posed by Pakistan ’s nuclear arsenal. Those cases have proved to be some of the hardest in modern nuclear strategy. And they prompt a question that has haunted past administrations: How do you compel a country to stop its drive for nuclear weapons when sanctions fail and military action seems far too risky? Past threats to isolate Iran were stymied first by high oil prices — which washed away the effects of modest economic sanctions — and then by Iran’s determination to enrich uranium no matter the cost. Mr. Obama has said  he will  try to engage Iran, but that has raised concerns both within the administration and among allies that the country’s nuclear program would be able to progress while talks proceeded. Advertisement Perhaps trying not to overload a Pakistani government that has shown itself to be overwhelmed by daily political and terrorist attacks, Mr. Obama made only oblique mention of a concern voiced frequently inside the White House: That Al Qaeda and other terrorists view Pakistan’s arsenal of 60 to 100 weapons as the ultimate goal of a campaign to destabilize that government. On the North Korean issue, President Bush’s six-party talks, a process that Mr. Obama has embraced, set up a diplomatic framework. But they still failed to prevent the country from harvesting the fuel for six or eight weapons, testing one device, and advancing plans to test missiles. The diplomatic challenge was underscored again while North Korea was preparing its latest missile test. In London last week, Mr. Obama raised the imminent test with President Hu Jintao of China, whom the United States has relied on to influence the North. A senior administration official, briefing reporters, said he believed the Chinese had expressed concerns to the North, urging it to halt the flight. If so, Beijing was ignored — as it was twice in 2006, when it told the North not to conduct missile tests and then its nuclear test. That suggests, one of Mr. Obama’s aides said Sunday, “that either the Chinese aren’t trying very hard, or the North Koreans aren’t listening very well.” An article on Monday about President Obama’s proposal for halting the proliferation of nuclear weapons, which he announced on Sunday while visiting the Czech Republic, misspelled the given name of the Czech prime minister. He is Mirek Topolanek, not Marek. Because of an editing error, an article on April 6 about a new strategy by President Obama for halting the proliferation of nuclear weapons, which he announced while visiting the Czech Republic, referred incorrectly to the square where Mr. Obama gave a speech on his proposals. He spoke in the square outside of Prague Castle; residents there do not consider that to be their city’s “central square.” Helene Cooper reported from Prague, and David E. Sanger from Vienna. Neil MacFarquhar contributed reporting from the United Nations.

"Paper straw factory to open in Britain as restaurants ditch plastic","Production line in Ebbw Vale, Wales, to make straws for McDonald’s and others  Sun 17 Jun 2018 12.25 BST   Last modified on Mon 13 Aug 2018 16.03 BST   No paper straws have been made in Britain for the last several decades. But that is about to change as a group of packaging industry veterans prepare to open a dedicated paper straw production line in Ebbw Vale, Wales , making hundreds of millions of straws a year for McDonald’s and other food companies as they prepare for a ban on plastic straws in the UK. “We spotted a huge opportunity, and we went for it,” said Mark Varney, sales and marketing director of the newly created paper straw manufacturer Transcend Packaging . “When the BBC’s Blue Planet II was on the telly and the government started talking about the dangers of plastic straws, we saw a niche in the market.” Varney and his business partners, all stalwarts of the packaging industry, watched as chains including Costa Coffee, Wetherspoons and Pizza Express announced plans to phase out plastic straws in favour of biodegradable paper. “It is great that all these businesses are phasing out plastic straws, but the problem for them was where to get paper ones from,” Varney said. “Everyone is having to import them from China, and when you look at the carbon footprint of that it kind of defeats the exercise.” So Varney and his partners set about opening what they reckon will be the only paper straw production plant in Europe. “We set up this company to give the the customers what they actually want: biodegradable paper straws made in the UK,” he said. Transcend signed a deal last week to supply straws to 1,361 McDonald’s outlets from September. The deal was agreed before Transcend has made its first straw as the company is waiting on delivery of machines from China. McDonald’s uses 1.8m straws a day in the UK. The Northern Irish factory of the Finnish packaging company Huhtamaki will also supply McDonald’s but is understood to not yet have paper straw production capabilities. Varney said the McDonald’s deal was just the tip of the iceberg and the company is in talks with several other restaurant groups about supplying straws. “Once a giant brand like McDonald’s says they are switching to paper, I suspect everyone else will follow,” he said. Paul Pomroy, chief executive of McDonald’s UK and Ireland, said the company’s decision to ditch plastic for paper was driven by its customers who “told us they wanted to see a move on straws but to do so without compromising their overall experience when visiting our restaurant”. Consumers have launched campaigns including The Last Straw, Straw Wars, Straws Suck and No Straw Please to encourage businesses to reduce use of plastic straws. The campaigns against straws gained momentum following the BBC’s Blue Planet II series which highlighted the danger plastic poses to marine life. The programme, which was the most watched TV show of 2017, featured a pilot whale calf which is thought to have died after consuming its mother’s milk contaminated with toxic chemicals from plastic. David Attenborough, who narrated the programme said: “Unless the flow of plastics into the world’s oceans is reduced, marine life will be poisoned by them for many centuries to come.” A 2015 YouTube video of a turtle whose head was impaled by a plastic straw has been watched more than 27m times. A report by the World Economic Forum has estimated that by 2050 there could be more plastic in the ocean than fish. Paper straws are more expense than plastic, but Varney said the cost is very small compared to the public relations benefit to brands of being able to say they are making a real effort to reduce plastic waste. Plastic straws cost about 10p per thousand, compared to 14-15p for paper alternatives. “McDonald’s, bless them, understood the massive difference to the environment,” Varney said. Transcend employs 20 people and plans to hire 200 by 2019 when the Ebbw Vale factory will be running at full capacity. “We think we are going to need 20 machines to fulfil what we want to deliver into the marketplace.”"
"Believe it or not, Barack Obama had Israel's best interest at heart","Though he detested Netanyahu, Obama was the most pro-Israel president since Truman. Trump, on the other hand, will drive a stake through hopes of peace  Tue 17 Jan 2017 16.26 GMT   Last modified on Fri 14 Jul 2017 18.55 BST   A merica has not one but two special relationships: one with Britain and one with Israel. When the two clash, the alliance with Israel usually trumps the one with Britain, as Tony Blair discovered to his cost in 2003. For the sake of the special relationship Blair dragged Britain into a disastrous war in Iraq, but in the aftermath of the war his American allies reneged on their promise to push Israel into a settlement with the Palestinians. Blair was no match to the power of the Israel lobby in the US. With American complicity, Israel’s occupation of the Palestinian territories has now reached its 50th year and there is still no light at the end of the tunnel. American politicians of both parties often use the mantra that the bond with Israel is unbreakable. But Israel’s continuing drift to the right has imposed serious strains on the relations with its principal ally and chief benefactor. In America, Israel is essentially an issue in domestic politics rather than foreign policy. And it is the subject of deep disagreement between the outgoing Obama administration and the incoming Trump administration. Things came to a head following the passage of UN Security Council resolution 2334 on 23 December with 14 votes in support and only the US abstaining. The resolution condemns Israel’s settlements on the West Bank as a flagrant violation of international law; demands that Israel “immediately and completely cease all settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem”; and reiterates the international consensus in favour of a two-state solution to Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The Obama administration allowed the resolution to be adopted because by their lights it was not anti-Israeli but, on the contrary, essential for preserving Israel as a Jewish and democratic country. For them this was a last-ditch attempt to arrest Israel’s slide towards apartheid and to preserve the possibility of a peaceful solution. In this respect the resolution was entirely consistent with US policy since 1967 in viewing Israeli settlements on occupied land as illegal and as an obstacle to peace. For Benjamin Netanyahu, however, the UN resolution was like a red rag to a bull. He lashed out in all directions, cancelling an aid program to Senegal; telling the New Zealand foreign minister that this resolution was tantamount to a declaration of war; summoning the ambassadors of the other countries who voted for the resolution for a dressing-down on Christmas Day; vowing to curtail funding for five UN institutions “that are particularly hostile towards Israel”; “punishing” Theresa May, one of the most pro-Israeli leaders in Europe, by cancelling a meeting with her in Davos; and accusing the Obama administration of treachery. That Obama detests Netanyahu is common knowledge. What is less well known is that Obama’s personal antipathy towards the prime minister co-exists with a genuine commitment to the welfare and security of the Jewish state. Obama’s actual record over his eight years in office makes him one of the most pro-Israeli American presidents since Harry S Truman. Obama has given Israel considerably more money and arms than any of his predecessors. He has fully lived up to America’s formal commitment to preserve Israel’s “qualitative military edge” by supplying his ally with ever more sophisticated weapons systems. His parting gift to Israel was a staggering military aid package of $38bn for the next 10 years. This represents an increase from the current $3.1 to $3.8bn per annum. It is also the largest military aid package from one country to another in the annals of human history. Netanyahu invariably repaid Obama’s generosity with ingratitude and abuse. He never missed an opportunity to attack Obama; he intervened crudely in the 2012 presidential elections by backing the Republican candidate; he abused the privilege of an address to a special session of both houses of Congress to insult their president; and he conducted the most vociferous public campaign to sabotage the nuclear agreement with Iran. One is hard put to think of a more blatant example of biting the hand that feeds you. Netanyahu’s conduct marks him out as the special ally from hell. Israel’s leader epitomizes what Senator J William Fulbright once called “the arrogance of power”. He is also devious and duplicitous. In the Bar-Ilan speech of 2009 , he paid lip service to the idea of a demilitarized Palestinian state alongside Israel. But, in the run-up to the 2015 election, he abruptly reversed this position and solemnly pledged that there would be no Palestinian state on his watch. Netanyahu has always believed what the Likud’s electoral platform continues to state explicitly: there can be no independent Palestinian state west of the Jordan River. He is a reactionary politician whose overriding aim is to preserve the status quo with Israel as a regional superpower, ruling over millions of disenfranchised Palestinians in what he and his colleagues insist on calling Judea and Samaria. Netanyahu presides over the most rightwing, jingoistic, pro-settler, and overtly racist coalition government in Israel’s history. He and his government are addicted to occupation – the root of all evil. In the teeth of almost universal condemnation, they continue to expand the Jewish settlements on the West Bank, thereby deliberately destroying the basis for a viable and territorially contiguous Palestinian state. Area C, where most of these settlements are located, comprises 60% of the West Bank. Several ministers, led by the ultra-nationalist Jewish Home party, advocate outright annexation of this area. A cabinet majority is pushing for a new law that would “legalize” the illegal Jewish outposts on the West Bank – illegal even by Israeli standards because they were built on private Palestinian land. This law, if passed by the Knesset, as seems very likely, will translate the ongoing practice of the ethnic cleansing of Palestine into official state policy. As is the case with Britain, at the core of the US-Israel special relationship are common values like freedom, democracy, the rule of law, justice, and equality. If anyone has betrayed these values, it is not the Obama administration but Israel’s hawk-infested cabinet. The Israeli hawks cannot wait for Donald Trump to enter the White House because he is a strong supporter not only of Israel itself but of the illegal settler movement. They believe he would give them a free pass to annex the rural parts of the West Bank and they hope that he will act on his promise to move the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem ̶ a move that would drive a stake through the two-state solution. Trump has tweeted his opposition to the Security Council resolution and promised that things will change after 20 January. As president he will be able to align American foreign policy more closely with Israel but he would not be able to reverse the latest Security Council resolution. He can tweet until he is blue in the face; the resolution will still stand. Resolution 2334 will not resolve the conflict but it has created a new legal framework and a new momentum. By instructing the UN Secretary-General to report every three months, the council put down a marker that from now on it intends to hold Israel to account for its actions. The resolution also opens the door for other bodies, such as the European Union and the International Criminal Court, to intensify their pressure on Israel to desist from its illegal practices on the West Bank and its war crimes in Gaza. Last but not least, the resolution provides a powerful impetus for BDS (boycott, divestment, and sanctions), the global grass-roots campaign against one of the most prolonged and brutal military occupations of modern times."
"How Trump is slowly destroying America's national security agencies","The president’s words and actions are deconstructing these vital agencies – and it might take years for the damage to be undone  Sat 25 Nov 2017 12.00 GMT   Last modified on Thu 5 Jul 2018 21.47 BST   T he Guardian has reported that John Le Carré, the famed British spy novelist, recently said of the Trump presidency: “Something truly, seriously bad is happening and we have to be awake to that.” Chillingly, he expressed alarm about the “toxic” parallels between the rise of Donald Trump and hard right regimes in Poland and Hungary and the rise of fascism in the 1930s. Le Carré may be overstating the risk of rising fascism but he is surely right to warn that many of Mr Trump’s early actions and words challenge fundamental tenets of democracy. These challenges include his assertion that the media is “the enemy of the people”, that news he doesn’t like is “fake news”, that there were “ good people ” among the neo-Nazi demonstrators in Charlottesville, and that the Senate should change its rules to abolish the requirement for 60 votes to end a filibuster, thus eliminating the single most important protection of minority interests in our system of government. At the same time, the Trump administration has mounted a systematic effort to “deconstruct the ‘administrative state’” , as his recently departed chief strategist, Steven Bannon, was fond of saying. Much of this effort has been focused on the regulatory agencies rather than the national security agencies. But make no mistake; the president’s words and actions are deconstructing those agencies with perhaps even greater consequences. Trump’s destructive impact on the national security agencies has two dimensions. First, his foreign policy of “America first” has called into question our commitment to our allies and the international framework and norms that have kept us safe and prosperous for 70 years. In turn, the American institutions and individuals who must execute this policy are undermined. Second, some of his actions and utterances are so far outside the bounds of responsible presidential conduct that many professionals who serve in the national security agencies lack confidence in him as commander-in-chief. Much damage has been done and whether it can be repaired, and if so how, is not clear. The world is wobbling on its axis under stresses caused by wars, ethnic tensions, instability, climate change and economic pressure in virtually every region. The liberal international order, largely established and led by the United States since the end of the second world war, is fraying. Trump’s “America first” policy pays scant heed to international cooperation and appears to believe that if we have enough military might we can make anything right. We can’t. Mr Trump has proposed cuts of nearly 30% in the state department budget The US military is already carrying a vast load and badly needs rest and replenishment. The Trump-proposed defense budget is a step in the right direction. But the shallowness of the “America first” policy, coupled with the president’s intemperate statements, which loosen us from our moral and ethical moorings, present a much deeper problem for the national security agencies. Much of our power comes from our values, our concern for minorities and our respect for the rule of law – at home and abroad. Russia, China, Iran, Syria, North Korea and many others care not for such things. Indeed, they are contemptuous of them. Former presidents and secretaries of state and defense know that we must wisely use all of the tools in the “national security toolbox”, a useful concept coined by the former secretary of state Madeleine Albright. Our values and moral leadership are among our most effective tools. As the former president George W Bush recently said : “When we lose sight of our ideals, it is not democracy that has failed. It is the failure of those charged with preserving and protecting democracy.” The liberal international order is fraying We also must lead. To do so, we need allies and skillful diplomacy carried out by adroit and experienced diplomats who are adequately resourced, supported and respected. Trump appears to have little or no appreciation of the value of diplomacy or foreign aid. If anything, the Trump administration seems oddly determined to cripple the department of state. Consider, for example, the president’s tweet saying that the secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, was “wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man”, a foolish utterance that makes any resolution of the North Korean threat vastly more difficult. On top of this brilliant strategic move, Trump has proposed cuts of nearly 30% in the state department budget and the elimination of 2,300 jobs. Furthermore, Tillerson’s use of outside management experts to restructure the department as if Exxon Mobil had just acquired a new oil drilling subsidiary has had the predictable effect. Diplomacy is sputtering on one cylinder and many of our best and brightest foreign service officers have quit in disgust. The administration is having a difficult time finding talented and experienced individuals to serve in the appointed jobs at state and defense. Applications for the foreign service are reportedly down and the department’s intention to no longer participate in the presidential management fellows program is deeply disturbing. Countless highly talented young Americans who were once inspired to serve our country now may go to Wall Street rather than Foggy Bottom. This is good for real estate values in the Hamptons, but very bad for our country. Roger Cohen’s column in the New York Times of 28 July chronicled this tragic exodus. He quoted several career ambassadors who described “a toxic, troubled organization” and “complete and utter disdain for our expertise”. Cohen concludes that “an American jewel (the State Department) is at stake, a place where honorable patriots take an oath to the Constitution” – not to any given president. Fortunately, Congress is having none of this tomfoolery. The Senate appropriations committee recently adopted a budget that adds $11bn to Trump’s request, but is still less than last year’s budget. It now goes to the House, whose members will hopefully agree. Regardless, the message to state department career employees is clear: “You are not important.” Tillerson is scheduled to unveil his proposed reorganization soon and there is great apprehension that his changes will gravely weaken the role of the state department and centralize power in political appointees at the expense of career professionals. All of this plays well with much of Trump’s base who are hostile to globalization. But a weakened and demoralized foreign service is a serious blow to American long term interests and security. The president’s foreign policy and his tweets are often hard to defend. Our allies wonder whether “America first” means “I’m last”. The president says he’ll honor America’s commitments, but that’s not what he said earlier. Does he mean it now, or is he just saying it because he’s been told to say it? Over the objection of our strongest allies, he backed out of the Paris climate accord and abandoned the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal that took years to negotiate. The Chinese are delighted at that move as it opens the field for them. It is no surprise that other countries, including many of our closest allies, have determined they must fend for themselves. There are media reports that several states, including South Korea and Japan, are considering developing nuclear weapons. In the absence of clear American leadership, more of the international fabric will unravel, with potentially disastrous consequences. Trump’s curiously lackluster response to Russia’s major effort to interfere in our recent election causes many national security professionals to privately question his leadership and fitness for the office. Some senators, notably John McCain, Bob Corker and Jeff Flake, are now expressing these sentiments publicly. Will their colleagues have the courage to speak up? How will history judge those who do not? The president’s refusal to consider any of the Republican former senior foreign policy officials who signed letters during the campaign expressing concern over his fitness to serve is a major mistake. The president should set aside his pique and bring them in. He and the country need them. This said, there are some hopeful signs. Trump has assembled some first-rate foreign policy advisers. There is criticism that it is too “general heavy”, but that is not well placed. Generals James Mattis, John Kelly and HR McMaster are combat-proven leaders and thinkers who have confronted the maddeningly complex wars in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. The president seems to be listening to them on vital matters such as North Korea, Afghanistan and the value of the Iranian nuclear deal. We must all hope he continues to listen to them. McMaster and Kelly have, by most reports, done a good job of organizing the policy process at the National Security Council. Whether careful decision making processes will hold in a crisis, where actions must be managed closely to avoid unintended escalation, remains to be seen. And in a crisis, the president’s inexperience and his tendency to tweet from the hip could be calamitous. If we stumble into an unnecessary nuclear war with North Korea because of poor presidential decisions, God help us all. In other national security agencies, things seem to be going well. The CIA director, Mike Pompeo, for example, gets high marks, although some career CIA officers worry that he is spending too much time in the Oval Office, thus risking the independence of his advice. But in many ways, Trump is causing intangible damage that may have the most lasting consequences. A recent article in Foreign Policy by Jon Cheatwood on the challenge of teaching cadets at West Point (my alma mater) in the age of Trump is deeply troubling. Cheatwood describes cadets who ask whether they could serve under this president. Other cadets, taking the lead of their commander-in-chief, cite “false news” to explain why they don’t trust the major media. Cheatwood worries that Mr Trump’s actions and tweets, such as belittling Democrats in front of Air Force Academy cadets, suggest his disregard for the norms of his office and “risks politicizing the military”. Military officer ranks were rattled by Trump’s shameful response earlier this year to the death of the navy Seal William Ryan Owens in a mission in Yemen that Mr Trump had authorized. He told Fox News the “generals” wanted to do the operation and “they lost Ryan”. Contrast this response with that of John F Kennedy, who publicly accepted full responsibility for the failure of the Bay of Pigs invasion early in his administration. Hopefully Trump now understands that a commander-in-chief must shoulder success and failure alike. Another example was the president’s repeated calls in a tense meeting with Mattis and the chairman of the joint chiefs, Gen Joseph Dunford, to fire Gen John Nicholson, the commander of US forces in Afghanistan, because we were “losing”. How can Gen Nicholson command, and how can his soldiers fight, if they hear the limb being sawed off behind them? The Trump administration is now past the initial days, when confusion and “rookie mistakes” are excusable. We are beginning to see what the true character of the man and his administration are. Echoing the concerns of John Le Carré, Mattis recently told a small group of soldiers: “You just hold the line – my fine young soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines – you just hold the line until our country gets back to understanding and respecting each other and showing it.” We must all “hold the line”."
"‘In Spite of It All, America’","Advertisement Supported by One of the new German government’s premier challenges will be to manage the trans-Atlantic relationship during Donald Trump’s presidency. Its success in this endeavor will be one way to measure its overall performance. We, a group of foreign policy experts from civil society, would like to offer some ideas. The liberal world order with its foundation in multilateralism, its global norms and values, its open societies and markets — is in danger. It is exactly this order on which Germany’s freedom and prosperity depends. The order is being challenged from various directions and sources: rising powers strive for influence; illiberal governments and authoritarian regimes are ascending; anti-modern thinking is gaining traction and influence even within Western democracies; Russia is challenging the peaceful European order; and new technologies are disrupting old economic structures. Lastly, the United States, inventor and — until recently — guardian of the liberal order, currently does not see itself as system guarantor. Donald Trump is the first U.S. president since World War II to fundamentally question the ideas and institutions of the liberal international order. He opposes this order by advocating a system of raw power and national interest. In his alternative system, small and medium sized countries play a role as dependent and secondary actors. Donald Trump is skeptical of any and all of the United States’ commitments to multilateral institutions and norms. With its preference for stable treaty-based alliances and long term, multilateral commitments, Germany sees the current international order as a cornerstone of its foreign policy. For Germany, Donald Trump’s foreign policy creates a previously unknown conflict of interest with its most important ally. Since Germany’s as well as Europe’s security and affluence rest upon the current international order even as President Trump charts a different course for the United States, an increased responsibility falls to the European Union and its member state Germany to safeguard and strengthen the international order. It is impossible to ignore that President Trump was able to attract the support of 60 million voters. It is also true that unilateral foreign policy, protectionist moods, and periodic calls for “America First” policies have a long tradition in the United States. Still, Donald Trump is a president sui generis whose ideas about international order do not fit within the modern American politician tradition. These ideas are supported by few in the United States. His disdain for international alliances and institutions is not even shared by many in the government he leads, much less by those outside of government. Donald Trump’s positions on global order are outside the mainstream of the foreign policy expert community in the United States. It is unclear, maybe even unlikely, that his strategy of undermining the international order will ever succeed in the United States and become his country’s policy. Some analysts and political actors in Germany would like to draw far-reaching conclusions from this period of uncertainty about the direction of the United States. They endorse a strategic reorientation for Germany. Some strive to decouple Europe’s foreign and security policy from the United States. Others place their faith in a German-French mini version of Europe. Sometimes, European aspirations only disguise German nationalism as a response to American nationalism. Some recommend that Germany should focus on ad hoc coalitions or maintain equidistance between Russia and the United States. Some even recommend that Germany should go further, and align itself with Russia or China in the future. All of these propositions are costly or dangerous — or both. Turning away from the United States would bring insecurity to Germany and ultimately to Europe. The bond with the United States was born from dependence, but it has long been in Germany’s core national interest. Today, no other actor in the world can offer the same advantages to Germany that it gains from its alliance with the United States. No other power takes on such far-reaching security guarantees and offers such comprehensive political resources. As a liberal hegemon, the United States made European integration possible. The majority of the political establishment in the United States continues to see the country as a supporter of European integration – also because it suits its own interest. The country needs allies that share its values and interests. If Germany wants to be an effective actor in Europe, it needs the United States. If the ties to the United States are cut, with them go the reassurance that other European countries need in order to accept a strong Germany in the center of the continent. The more leadership that Germany can and should take on, the closer the coordination must be with the United States. Decoupling from the United States would fundamentally question one of the most important political and cultural achievements of the past 70 years: Germany’s integration in the West. In aligning itself with the West Germany also committed itself to the values of freedom and democracy, and to cooperation with all those who stand for these values. Freedom is the precondition for human beings to lead a self-determined and dignified live. Germany has committed itself to this set of ideas in its constitution, the Basic Law. Its anchoring in the West gave Germany the steadfastness to resist the Communist regimes and make possible Germany and European reunification. A departure from this trans-Atlantic orientation will renew the threat of a special path ( Sonderweg ) of Germany, it will strengthen nationalists on the left and the right, and it will endanger the peaceful European order. The West, even today, does not exist without the United States, neither as a concept, nor as a political subject America is the anchor of liberal universalism and the open world order. Even if Donald Trump’s presidency carries significant risks for the liberal order, these perils will not diminish if Germany puts its strategic partnership with the United States at stake. A strategic decoupling from the United States would ultimately endanger the liberal international order more than prudent cooperation with a United States whose leadership currently rattles this order. Autocracies such as China and Russia can be important ad hoc partners for single projects; the United States, however, must remain the strategic partner for a democratic and European Germany. The relationship with the United States is a values-based partnership built on our democratic political systems. Even if the current U.S. president challenges significant elements of the political system, the United States remains a democracy. President Trump is not America, nor is the illiberal movement for which he stands a solely American phenomenon. In Europe too it has made its mark. What we see today is not a divergence between Europe and the United States; it is a conflict within the West unfolding on both sides of the Atlantic. Finally, the economic, scientific, and cultural linkages with the United States are far stronger than with any other region in the world. The interplay with the United States remains a central element of Europe’s capacity for innovation. So, how do we engage with the United States in times of Donald Trump? Even if turning away from the United States is not a responsible option for Germany, business as usual is not an option with the current presidency either. It would be equally unhelpful to stay silent and look the other way, waiting until this presidency is finally over and a successor occupies the White House. Four or even eight years is too long to sit it out, especially since there will not be a return to the supposed good old times. German policy now requires something that it did not need before: a U.S. strategy. A responsible policy toward the United States must be long-term and build a bridge into the post-Trump age. This policy must look beyond an exceptional period of U.S. skepticism toward any multilateral commitment. However, Germany must not fall prey to the illusion that there will be a return to the status quo ante following the Trump Presidency. Several political trends in the United States will outlive Trump’s time in office — for example, the demand for more balanced burden-sharing between Europe and the United States within NATO. However, the end of the Trump presidency should be the end of the inner Western conflict about the fundamentals of the world order. Once this fundamental consensus is reestablished policy disagreements can be resolved or bridged more easily and more constructively. This long-term goal must be the point of reference for Germany’s short-term engagement with the Trump administration. In the short term, Germany must learn to distinguish between the problems that are solvable, those that are unsolvable, and those in between that require pragmatic management. It goes without saying that the German government should double down on those policy areas where it finds common ground with the current U.S. administration. But successful relationship management in times of Donald Trump may also require to adjust an increasingly untenable position or — vice versa — to enter into a limited conflict. Finally, we will need to look for partners not only at the highest federal levels, but elsewhere in the administration, in the U.S. Congress, in the states, in civil society, and in business. It will be more important than ever to manage differences responsibly. In its own long-term interest, Germany should attempt to handle these differences with the Trump administration in such a way that does not escalate them or allow them to spiral out of control. Germany should not succumb to illusions: large scale joint projects with the Trump government will have little chance for success in policy areas that are central to President Trump’s populist agenda. Trying to do too much in these key policy areas will only cause new disagreements. In short, Germany’s U.S. strategy must allow for multitasking: to actively pursue key national interests in collaboration with the United States, to moderate conflicts, to avoid unrealistic ambitions, and to thus build a bridge to a better future for trans-Atlantic relations. This nuanced approach will have different consequences for the different policy areas. Soberingly, the signs are not favorable for larger projects in several policy areas that would actually be vital, such as trade policy. Despite all controversies, the strategic and economic reasons for a trans-Atlantic free trade agreement (TTIP) have not disappeared since November 2016. Some in Berlin and Brussels hope that one can resurrect TTIP in an adapted version. This idea is illusory, maybe even dangerous. A president who castigates all free trade agreements as unfair toward the United States will not easily compromise in international negotiations. A negotiating failure will be more devastating to the project than a long hibernation. There are signs already that the United States and the European Union might be headed toward trade disputes. The European Union must react to punitive tariffs. But it should do so exclusively in a legal, proportional, and symmetrical manner. Everything else could trigger an unwanted escalation. Joint initiatives regarding international refugee policy do not look very promising either. The global system of protection, however, urgently needs to be reformed to cope with modern conditions. The rights of refugees need to be protected while illegal migration needs to be curtailed, organized trafficking should be combated so that the universal refugee regime is not undermined. Equally important will be a push toward new and improved United Nations’ resettlement programs. However, it appears difficult to imagine that the Trump administration will agree to such initiatives. Consequently, Europe must become active itself here — as best as it can. Therefore, trade and refugee policies fall in the category of currently difficult, hardly resolvable issues. The best we can expect is limited progress, but no large scale initiatives. Security policy is a different matter. Without the United States there will be no security for and in Germany for the foreseeable future. This applies to territorial as well as alliance defense within NATO, but also to nuclear deterrence, to combating cyber crimes and money laundering, and finally to counterterrorism and the cooperation of intelligence agencies. No single European country, not Germany, not any other country, and not the European Union, can provide the necessary resources to guarantee the continent’s security. Therefore, the existing cooperation must be strengthened. Remaining committed to NATO also provides a way to integrate the United States into the structures of multilateral security policy and may dissuade Washington from going it alone. Alliance defense is the most cost-effective form of defense. Germany should thus take seriously the call for fairer burden-sharing within the alliance. Acting against its own core interest, Germany has not done enough in this respect. Germany still has a long way to go until it’s NATO goals and commitments are met. To be clear: Germany agreed to increase its defense expenditures toward 2 percent of its GDP. Germany should keep its word. To present this commitment as a threat to the military balance in European is to get it backwards. It is precisely our European neighbors and partners that are asking for more German commitment within the NATO framework and within European defense policy. It would be even better if Germany were to invest an extra percentage point of GDP into development assistance, international police operations, UN missions, conflict prevention, and diplomacy. With this linkage, nonmilitary aspects of security would also be upgraded. This would substantially strengthen European defense capabilities within the trans-Atlantic alliance. Germany would do something that is in its own interest and would stabilize the trans-Atlantic alliance at the same time. It would address concerns of the Trump administration and build good will for the time after Donald Trump. The chances of success for this strategy are high: Despite all of the skeptical rhetoric about NATO, the Trump administration has fulfilled America’s NATO commitments so far. Security policy cooperation with the Trump government should be central to Germany and should also include security guarantees for the central and eastern European NATO members, support for an independent Ukraine, as well as the stabilization of the North African coast. In the conflict over North Korea’s nuclear weapons program and the uncertainties around future Iran policy, a trans-Atlantic schism should be avoided. We should do whatever possible to convince the Trump administration of joint approaches. There is one more policy area in which the German government should reconsider its position to open the door for productive cooperation: energy security policy . The United States has identified Nord Stream 2, the planned pipeline running through the Baltic Sea to Russia, as a geostrategic project. They are correct. More important: This pipeline project is not in the joint European interest. Nord Stream 2 contradicts a policy of greater energy independence and undermines the envisaged European Energy Union. We should try to identify a joint approach with our European partners and the United States. After having addressed the solvable issues and set aside the unsolvable issues for now, one will need to turn to those policy areas that require responsible conflict management. It would be useless to try to convince the U.S. administration of the importance of the Paris Climate Agreement, but it is equally wrongheaded to isolate President Trump on international climate and energy policy. Necessary criticism should not turn into dogmatism. Instead, Germany should seek concrete steps forward in climate protection together with the United States. Germany does not need President Trump in order to engage with partners who are interested in climate policy cooperation. A number of states (not just California) and large cities are already rapidly reducing their CO 2 emissions. Political, scientific, and technical cooperation with local partners is possible. There is no shortage of potent allies on climate policy in the United States, in the private sector as well as in civil society. Here, the key is to be proactive, to invest money, and to build networks that will endure and outlast the Trump administration. Digital policy is another policy area where confrontation is possible — about regulatory questions as well as about market shares. It is important to identify points of contention as soon as possible and to avoid unnecessary escalation. Sealing off Europe’s and the United States’ digital markets from each other will seriously damage the outlook for jobs and growth on both sides of the Atlantic. European consumer and data protection standards might be able to be maintained globally if they have U.S. support, but certainly not without it. Making progress with the Trump administration wherever possible, moderating conflicts and avoiding escalation, expanding the spectrum of trans-Atlantic partners beyond the current U.S. administration — these are all core aims of a U.S. strategy that can preserve the trans-Atlantic partnership with and if necessary against this American President, and function beyond his time in office. The United States has proved its capacity for self-correction repeatedly. America remains the indispensable power for those countries that stand for freedom and democracy and strive for an open world order. But Europe — and thus Germany — must do more to support and preserve these values. More European self-reliance is imperative. It would be an error of historical proportions to play out “more Europe” against the trans-Atlantic alliance. The new German government’s foreign policy will be measured by how clearly it pursues this course. • Deidre Berger, Ramer Institute, American Jewish Committee, Berlin • James D.

"Davos 2014: World Economic Forum - Day Two as it happened","All the action from the second day of WEF, including a special address from Iranian president Hassan Rouhani  Graeme Wearden in Davos and  Sean Farrell in London  Thu 23 Jan 2014 19.06 GMT    First published on Thu 23 Jan 2014 07.49 GMT     7.28pm GMT  And that's all for today -- big day tomorrow, with David Cameron and George Osborne speaking, along with Shimon Peres, Bill Gates, Al Gore, Wolfgang Schauble, Dilma Rousseff, Haruhiko Kuroda, John Kerry, Mario Draghi, Nouriel Roubini.....   Thanks, and goodnight. GW  7.18pm GMT  Google boss Eric Schmidt has been telling reporters of his concerns over the US US National Security Agency's data tapping programme - saying that: ﻿" The fact that you can do this monitoring does not mean that you should do this monitoring". Schmidt: "If Google were to significantly violate someone's privacy the press would have a field day... & Google would lose billions" #wef14 Schmidt told the Guardian earlier this week that he didn't know the NSA has tapped Google's data. Updated at 7.25pm GMT  7.06pm GMT  Dimon, who has been keeping a low profile at Davos, told CNBC during a TV interview that some of the $20bn worth of legal penalties agreed with the US government weren't really justified, as some related to activities carried out by firms before JP Morgan bought them.  "I think a lot of it was unfair, but I am not going to go into the details," Dimon said. JP Morgan's single biggest fine, of $13bn, was paid to settle multiple government claims over dealings in mortgage securities by JPMorgan, and also by Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual, which it took over as the financial crisis broke out. Dimon added that he could have fought the cases, but it would have been "criminal for me to subject our company to those kinds of issues."  5.48pm GMT  Only in Davos....the Duke of York is tweeting about the importance of fighting inequality. Growth and countering inequality important themes at Davos this year. Meeting tempo high with great ideas to follow in coming months. AY Updated at 6.28pm GMT  5.44pm GMT  Missed these earlier -- just a small example of the interest in Hassan Rouhani's speech today. Here at #WEF  #Davos lot of interest in Iran as its president delivers interesting speech - suddenly businesses talking about its potential Abe shakes hands with Rouhani pic.twitter.com/XdPfardb0x (via @GhorbaniSadegh ) #Davos  #WEF  5.30pm GMT   This is his first Davos since Ireland left its bailout programme. And with Moody's raising its credit rating to investment grade earlier this month, Kenny has good reason to feel cheerier as he mingles with other leaders and business leaders.  "We've had three very tough budgets", he reminds me, saying Ireland needed  a plan with clarity, and the courage and conviction to implement it. "Now we're seen the back of the bailout, the Troika are gone." Kenny also doesn't expect to see a big surge of support for Irish eurosceptic candidates in May's European elections, as looks likely in other countries. The Irish people know the importance of Europe, having voted on it so many times - including twice on the Lisbon treaty, he points out. Updated at 5.37pm GMT  5.18pm GMT  Davos may be taking the attention but it was China influencing the markets today. News that a manufacturing survey from the country had disappointed was initially taken phlegmatically by investors. That was, until Wall Street woke up and decided it did not like the idea of a slowdown in the Chinese economy. So with the Dow dipping - down 175 points or 1% by the time European markets closed - it was the excuse to take some profits. The final scores on the doors:  5.10pm GMT  Davis Cameron, who gives his speech to Davos tomorrow morning, has given interviews to the BBC and ITV on the UK economy. They'll be broadcast tonight. Talking to @Peston about how our #LongTermEconomicPlan is bringing security & opportunity. See it on @BBCNews at 6pm. pic.twitter.com/SA7GO2aSDS I also told @tombradby about why we're working to a #LongTermEconomicPlan and who it's for - more on @itvnews at 6.30 pic.twitter.com/DOY06ttGqm Updated at 5.19pm GMT  4.19pm GMT  On a more serious note, Nick Clegg also spoke about the dangers of bilateral trade deals -- he'd rather see more multinational deals to help weaker countries compete with the strong.  4.16pm GMT  A light-hearted moment, as t he d ebate about China involving Nick Clegg and Lloyd Blankfein turns to the lack of hotel rooms in Davos. "You pay a lot of money to sleep in a thin bed". It is so bad his Wanda Group - which has  invested £1bn in the UK recently - might build a 5 star hotel in the alpine resort.  4.12pm GMT   Frances O'Grady, TUC general secretary has been lobbying Europe's trade commissioner, Karel de Gucht, about the terms of the proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). She tells us unions are concerned that the deal would give multi-national corporations the right to bypass the courts and challenge governments if they thought decisions by the state interfered with their ability to do business. O'Grady said she was pleased that Brussels had bowed to criticism and put the proposal out to public consultation. She warned that as currently planned, TTIP would allow American companies to challenge any attempts to reverse privatisation of parts of the NHS. "The very threat that US health multi-nationals would use this mechanism would tie the hands of a new government in following through the changes which we want to see." She added: "We are not anti-trade or anti-growth but this can't be a free for all for business at the expense of workers or pubic services."  Updated at 4.52pm GMT  2.48pm GMT  IMF chief Christine Lagarde tweets that she hopes to discuss "gender driven growth" during her time at Davos. That fits with Japan PM Shinzo Abe's pledge last night to get more women into the Japanese economy. Arrived in Davos. Looking forward to discussions on global outlook and gender driven growth. #wef14  2.43pm GMT  Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu was not impressed by Iranian president Hassan Rouhani's speech this morning -- Netanyahu told the WEF in his own special address that these were a “change in words and unchanging deeds". Arab countries, the Israeli PM said: understand that Iran remains aggressive, supports terror, that it participates in the slaughter in Syria, that it is pursuing the development of ballistic missile and plutonium for nuclear weapons.   Asked about the peace talks, Netanyahu added that central Arab governments saw Israel as a partner in pushing back threats from the arming of Iran and the Muslim Brotherhood. There was more support a “reasoned solution” to Israel and Palestanians than before.  (That's via Jill Treanor) Updated at 3.33pm GMT  2.39pm GMT   Guy Ryder, the director-general of the International Labour Organisation said a lot of people in Davos were stressing the need to tackle inequality but were at the same time pursuing policies that were likely to make the problem worse. Ryder told Larry Elliott: ﻿The IMF has been expressing strong concern about inequality but how do the the IMF's own policies impact on growth or reduce unemployment? Ryder said the ILO was in favour of moves that would reduce inequality such as job creation, collective bargaining and increasing minimum wages. However, the strategy followed by the so-called troika of the IMF, the EU and the ECB in the bailed-out countries of Europe is starkly different. Collective bargaining coverage had been reduced by 80% in Portugal and almost dismantled in Greece. Minimum wages have been cut, said Ryder, asking: Is this the answer? Is this the sort of situation people think will be for the long-term good of the economy or society more generally? The ILO and the IMF established a joint agenda to reduce unemployment and tackle inequality in 2010, but admitted the initiative had lost momentum. Ryder says he wants to strengthen the relationship. ﻿I want to engage with the IMF and talk over some of these important issues. I would like to put momentum back into the relationship." Updated at 3.35pm GMT  2.35pm GMT  US factory output growth has hit a three-month low because of disruption from January's freezing weather, the Markit Flash purchasing manager index showed. But the index still registered growth for January and was slightly higher than last year's monthly average. It's the first indicator of national economic trends for 2014 in the world's biggest economy and follows steady US jobs data also released today. Chris Williamson, Chief Economist at Markit, said: The flash PMI indicates that the manufacturing sector continued to grow at the start of 2014, and that the underlying trend most likely remained reassuringly robust. After allowing for companies that saw production and sales disrupted by the cold weather, the rate of growth of output and orders remained as strong, if not stronger, than seen late last year. The US numbers add to a pretty positive day on the PMI front. The surveys are closely watched because they're a strong indicator of the way the economy is moving. Figures from Germany and the wider eurozone were both surprisingly good though the market has been fretting about a slowdown in Chinese manufacturing reported overnight. The number of Americans making new unemployment benefit claims rose slightly last week but the underlying trend remained positive. Here's an excerpt from Reuters' story: Initial claims for state unemployment benefits ticked up 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 326,000, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Claims for the prior week were revised to show 1,000 fewer applications received than previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had expected first-time applications for jobless benefits to hold steady at 326,000 in the week ended January 18. The four-week average for new claims, considered a better measure of underlying labor market conditions as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 3,750 to 331,500. Employers added only 74,000 new jobs to their payrolls in December after creating 241,000 positions the prior month. That was at odds with other employment indicators that suggested a brisk pace of hiring in December. Economists have dismissed the sharp step-back in job growth as a fluke, noting that a cold snap during the month weighed on construction , transportation and utilities payrolls.

It's only Bob Diamond in the queue for a global philanthropy round table... pic.twitter.com/h9YTLRgCB7 Bob Diamond is back, beaming, and bouncing around Davos like a 'master of the universe'. Hard to imagine he only fell from grace 18 mths ago  2.19pm GMT  Speaking at a press conference here in Davos, Mantega said that the "strong recovery of the US is important", but it is still at its first step. It will mean an "immediate" negative impact on developing countries because of the withdrawal of stimulus measures from the US Federal Reserve (which has helped to push capital into the developing world). But in the future, Brazilian companies should benefit as US firms will have increased demand for their products and resources. ﻿So on the middle-term, I would say this [the US recovery] is a positive outlook. Mantega also pointed out that Brazil came fourth on a survey asking CEOs which companies they were most interested in investing in (despite unpopular tax changes and missed growth targets on Mantega's watch). Mantega said fighting inflation would remain a top priority for Brazil's government, but declined to say whether Brazil's president, Dilma Rousseff, will announce changes to Brazil's fiscal targets tomorrow (as is rumoured). She is due at Davos tomorrow to try to reassure investors. As Reuters explained last week : ﻿Presidential aides said Rousseff decided it was time for a personal visit to Davos so she could show investors Brazil wants their business, explaining private concessions her government is granting to build roads, railways, airports and other badly needed infrastructure.  Updated at 3.36pm GMT  2.01pm GMT  Sir Win Bischoff is going to be the chairman of the Financial Reporting Council . Bischoff, who steps down as Lloyds chairman in early April, will start at the audit and corporate reporting watchdog on 1 May. He will be almost 73 when he takes over from Baroness Hogg and will expect a quieter life at the FRC than at Lloyds. He'll earn a reported £120,000 a year for two days' work a week. Bischoff was this week criticised by Lord Levene, who said he handed Bischoff a memo outlining the dangers of the Co-op Bank's bid for more than 600 Lloyds branches long before the deal collapsed. Bischoff had said he couldn't remember the document. The FRC has been pretty busy lately. Today it told auditors to pay more attention to the risk of fraud when companies state their accounts and to check they are complying with regulations. It told auditors to exercise "greater professional scepticism" too. Updated at 2.36pm GMT  1.38pm GMT  Improving economic news means another bad year for gold . Prices are expected to fall 13% this year, according to a report by Thomson Reuters GFMS. Gold plunged 28% last year as investors dropped gold-based investments and Indian import controls constrained demand there. The gold price surged to a record in 2011, as investors worried about the eurozone and the prospect of rampant inflation caused by loose US monetary policy. The price crashed last year as both those fears receded. The report said gold would probably not hit last year's low of $1,180 an ounce in 2014 because physical demand from China would take hold if the price hits about $1,200. Andrew Leyland, GFMS manager, told Reuters: Tapering [of the US Federal Reserve's bond buying programme] will continue throughout the course of the year and the global economy will tend to get slightly better. There's little reason for the flight to gold you saw at the beginning of the financial crisis to start up again. Updated at 2.44pm GMT  1.20pm GMT  Schulz argued that Europe must recognise that migration, and mobility, is inevitable. It must introduce new rules to handle legal migration, to combat recent tragedies in which hundreds of people have died trying to reach the EU. We need a better, improved, temporary protection for those coming from regions of civil war and natural disaster and what to stay for a limited time and get back, said Schulz. He cited example of Lebanon, where refugees came to Europe during its conflict, and later went back to rebuild the country. The US, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand all have rules for legal migration, said Schulz - saying that America lets people apply to migrate and "sooner or later, usually later" they get an answer. Instead, in Europe, "what we allow is an overwhelming illegal process, when we need a legal process." Europe must recognise we are a continent of immigration, and we need a rule, he concluded.      Updated at 3.37pm GMT  1.14pm GMT  Following up on Bank of England ratesetter Paul Fisher's speech, Reuters has published a poll of economists that chimes with his view that a rate rise is "some way off". Two-thirds of the 50-plus economists interviewed thought a rate rise was at least a year away – even though they expect unemployment to fall to the BoE's stated 7% threshold in the next few months. Reuters conducted the poll after yesterday's news that unemployment had fallen much quicker than the BoE expected to 7.1%. Two-thirds of the economists in the Reuters poll didn't think BoE governor Mark Carney would change the terms of his forward guidance. He has always said the 7% level was not an automatic trigger but some commentators have said he would need to lower the threshold or add wage growth to the equation to hold off a rate rise. Carney gives a speech in Davos tomorrow. Maybe he'll say more on the subject then. Updated at 1.18pm GMT  1.12pm GMT  Sutherland -- who is also the UN Secretary General's Special Representative for Migration and Development, said some of the views expressed are not compatible with a civilised society.  Speaking on a WEF panel discussion titled "Immigration, welcome or not?", Sutherland said: It is already evident that in the European elections there has been a significant rise for parties which I would consider to be advocating xenophobic responses rather than positive responses to migration. I think that this is extremely unfortunate, and I think it is time for the debate to be carried directly to those who advocate these positions.       Sutherland cited UKIP in Britain, the rise of Le Pen in France, and strong support for Austrian parties who oppose migration, adding: ﻿Right across Europe there is a negative view about migration which not merely contradicts some of the values which many of us associate particularly with the European Union but more generally with civilized society. He also accused migration's opponents of "grossly" distorting the impact of migration on societies, insisting: The evidence is overwhelming that migration plays a very positive role in the development of countries. And that migrants generally play a positive, constructive role in economic activity. The perceptions are totally out of line with reality.       Updated at 3.38pm GMT  12.34pm GMT  Catching up on today's purchasing managers index (PMI) data, eurozone businesses got off to a much better start this year than expected . Stronger growth across the region was only let down by a lingering downturn in France, surveys showed. Here's the gist, with some help from Reuters: Markit's Flash Eurozone Composite PMI rose to 53.2 in January, up from 52.1 last month. The result was healthily over the 50 mark that shows growth. It was also the highest reading since mid-2011 and beat all the forecasts in a Reuters poll of 25 economists. An earlier composite PMI from France showed activity shrank for the third month running in January. However, the contraction eased from last month and results from services and factories beat expectations. Germany's composite PMI hit a 31-month high. However, weak PMI figures from China overnight have worried the market, helping send the FTSE 100 down almost 15 points to 6811. More Eurozone economic news from Spain with unemployment staying stubbornly above 25% even though the economy has creaked into growth. Here's Bloomberg's take: Spain’s unemployment remained above 25% for a sixth straight quarter, underpinning the extent of the damage wrought by a six-year slump in the euro region’s fourth-largest economy. The jobless rate was at 26.03% of the workforce in the three months through December compared with 25.98% in the previous quarter, the National Statistics Institute in Madrid said today. Economists expected the rate to remain unchanged, according to the median of seven forecast in a Bloomberg News survey. Over the same period, the economy grew 0.3% from the third quarter, while it contracted 1.2% in 2013 from the previous year, the Bank of Spain said today, confirming the government’s estimate. That’s its first two straight quarters of expansion in over two years.

James Quinn of the Telegraph has the details: Mr Osborne said that chief executives and chairmen need to move beyond the financial crisis era mentality, where many business leaders retreated for fear of negative sentiment, and be more open in telling the success story that is British business. The Chancellor is understood to have said that business was not through the 'denial phase' and should move on to the front foot. Here's his story:  George Osborne tells UK business leaders to 'step up'   Osborne is due to appear on a panel tomorrow morning with other finance ministers.    12.10pm GMT  Here's a different kind of FCA story. Money Marketing reports that the watchdog and its predecessor the Financial Services Authority spent almost £200,000 on flowers to brighten up the office in the last five years. The story says: A freedom of information request, submitted by Money Marketing , found the FCA and FSA spent a total of £198,968 between 2009 and 2013 on plants and flowers for its London and Edinburgh offices and for events, at an average cost of £3,316 a month, or £765 a week. Over the period, it spent £149,432 on its two London offices, £21,747 on its Edinburgh office and £27,787 on flowers for high profile events. The FSA stopped purchasing flowers for high profile events in August 2012. Between the FCA’s inception on 1 April 2013 and 31 December 2013, it spent a total of £22,004 on flowers, equivalent to £2,444 a month, or £564 a week. Of this, £18,584 was spent on its London offices and £3,419 on its Edinburgh office. An FCA spokeswoman told Money Marketing the contract for the flowers is value for money. Here's a tweet from one of the mag's reporters: FCA spent £200K on flowers in 5 years. If only they had spent more checking Paul Flowers.... http://t.co/Nw7AXv2ssJ Story by @TessaNormanMM  12.08pm GMT  Australian PM Tony Abbott's speech on his priorities for the G20 was slightly overshadowed by Rouhani's address beforehand -- but it contained a call to for more free trade, and tax reform. ﻿ Trade comes first. Every time one person freely trades with another, wealth increases. At the very least, the G20 should renew its resolve to undo any protectionist measures put in place since the crisis.” Updated at 3.38pm GMT  11.59am GMT  Former UK prime minister Tony Blair is in Davos, and has welcomed Hassan Rouhani's presence this year too, but warned that Iran needs to 'step back' from the threshold of nuclear weapons capability for a comprehensive deal to be agreed. Here's the details, from an interview with Bloomberg: Francine Lacqua (FL): Talk to me a little bit about the last two weeks which has been huge for the Middle East. Is Iran is getting closer to being accepted by the international community. Do you think it will go the full way? Will we have an accord on nuclear arms by the end of this year?  Tony Blair (TB): I mean I hope so, but it really depends on whether Iran’s prepared to take a strategic decision to give up nuclear weapons ambitions and step back from being a nuclear threshold state. So I think the previous negotiation gave a space and an opportunity to conclude the real deal but we should not be in any doubt at all,  the real deal is that they step back from that threshold because if they don’t, the implications are very serious for the region. Other countries will try an acquire the same capability and then you have even more instability in a region already unstable.  11.55am GMT  The Financial Conduct Authority has doled out its first fine of 2014 - a chunky £7.6m punishment for South Africa's Standard Bank for deficient checks on money laundering. The FCA said between 2007 and 2011 Standard Bank's UK arm didn't carry out proper checks on corporate customers connected to "politically exposed persons" - people prominent in politics or high up in public office. The watchdog's account of the bank's failings is pretty scathing: Standard Bank provided loans and other services to a significant number of corporate customers who emanated from or operated in jurisdictions which have been identified by industry recognised sources as posing a higher risk of money-laundering. Standard Bank identified issues relating to its ability to conduct ongoing reviews of customer files early in the relevant period, but failed to take the necessary steps to resolve the issues. The City has faced long-standing accusations that it is used by foreign dictators and corrupt officials to launder their ill-gotten gains. In 2011 the Financial Services Authority, the FCA's predecessor, published a report into banks' dealings with potentially dubious politicians and public officials that highlighted major failings. At the time the watchdog was surprised how little pickup the report got. The FCA said the fine was the first anti-money laundering penalty under its new tougher regime and the first to punish poor laundering checks in commercial banking. Press release: Standard Bank PLC fined £7.6m for failures in its anti-money laundering controls http://t.co/OWC0MbFhMM Updated at 11.55am GMT  11.27am GMT  Retail sales growth slowed this month, a CBI survey shows. The employer lobby's distributive trades poll for sales came in worse than expected with a balance of +14 compared with analyst expectations for a+25 reading, according to Reuters. Grocers and furniture shops held up well but clothing sales slumped because of the unseasonally mild weather this month. The balance figure for December was +34.The number shows the difference between retailers reporting sales rising and falling. The figures suggest that, after a solid Christmas, the high street is quiet again now normal service has resumed. Retailers expect similarly "modest" sales growth next month too. Barry Williams of Asda, who chairs the CBI distributive trades survey panel, said: At a time of year when shoppers are recovering from the excesses of Christmas and watching their spending carefully, it’s encouraging that high street sales have continued to grow. While retailers predict some modest growth ahead, the prospect of continually slow pay growth is likely to mean cautious consumers for some time to come. Here's the pithy verdict of Steve Collins at London & Capital Asset Management: A 'miss' for CBI reported sales at +14 v +25 #UK Updated at 11.53am GMT  11.13am GMT  And the president did lay out a vision -- telling the World Economic Forum that he hopes to build closer ties with the rest of the world. Describing his approach as one of "prudent moderation", Rouhani vowed to unlock Iran's economic potential. At one point in the speech ( highlights start here ), Rouhani said that Iran has the potential to become one of the world's 10 largest economies within the next three decades, if it could establish normal economic ties and see oil sanctions lifted. An active foreign policy can boost economic development, he argued -- saying the financial crisis had taught that countries cannot lock themselves away. And with a nod to WEF's own theme for Davos, he said that successful economies must also be ethical . Rouhani had travelled to Davos hoping to build relationships with business leaders, and he revealed during his speech that he had held talks with oil firms this morning. Unlock our oil reserves, he argued, and we can generate the activity needed for economic growth, and ultimately for peace. But the political situation in the Middle East loomed over Rouhani. On Syria, he said that "free and fair elections" must be held in the crisis-striven country , but also blamed "ruthless killers flooding into" Syria. And Rouhani reiterated that Iran's nuclear ambitions are peaceful - pledging that Tehran had no plans for a nuclear weapon. However, on the issue of 'dual use' nuclear systems, he said Iran was not prepared to be discriminated against. Rouhani also expressed confidence that a permanent, comprehensive deal on Iran's nuclear programme could be developed -- unless other parties don't show enough serious will . And despite some probing from WEF founder Klaus Schwab , Rouhani declined to include Israel in the circle of countries which it is keen to build closer ties with. Only "all countries who we have officially recognised" form part of his goal for developing Iran's economy. Updated at 11.22am GMT  10.49am GMT  Standard Chartered's boss dismissed talk that his bank might soon be taken over as " rubbish ". The bank's shares jumped yesterday after the FT suggested potential bidders ranged from Australia's ANZ to Wells Fargo of the US. Here are some snippets from Reuters' report: "It's speculative rubbish," Peter Sands told Reuters Insider television at the World Economic Forum. "The bank is in very good shape, we have great opportunities in our markets, we have a very clear strategy and we have a great team." Sands, who has been chief executive since 2006, also played down talk that he could move to become chairman or that Mike Rees, who was named deputy CEO in this month's reshuffle, is being lined up as a replacement. "I have no plans to do anything else," Sands said, adding that he is "very happy" in his job. "I've made very clear I have no interest in becoming chairman and I've never expressed any desire to do so." It's a refreshing change from the standard "we don't comment on rumour and speculation" response. From this tweet, it looks like Sands was even more fed up with the subject when CNBC spoke to him: Peter Sands @StanChart CEO on rumors it's a likely takeover target: "there's speculation that's such rubbish I don't even bother to read it" Updated at 11.53am GMT  10.40am GMT  Paul Fisher , a Bank of England ratesetter, has given a speech this morning. Most of it reiterates the guidance in this week's minutes from the recent Monetary Policy Committee meeting: "no immediate need" to raise rates if unemployment falls to the 7% threshold, rates will rise gradually when the time comes etc. The main line from Fisher, who is the BoE's director of markets, is this : My own judgement is that we are still some way off the point where it is appropriate to start raising Bank Rate. Aldermore, the specialist small business bank, tweeted to that effect: "We are still some way off the point where it is appropriate to start raising Bank Rate," states Paul Fisher, BoE: http://t.co/rUkgN48bsf Updated at 11.54am GMT  10.39am GMT  As my colleague Fiona Walsh has pointed out, the number of women chairing FTSE 100 companies is about to double. Shire, the pharmaceuticals group, has announced that Susan Kilsby will take over from long-serving chairman Matthew Emmens at the end of April. At the moment, Alison Carnwath at Land Securities is the only woman chair in the FTSE 100. There have been two women board leaders in the top 100 companies before. Between 2008 and 2010 Baroness Hogg chairship of 3i overlapped with Carnwath's tenure at Land Securities. Like Carnwath, Kilsby, who is from the US, started off as an investment banker. She's been a non-exec at Shire since 2011. Let's see if she is replaced by another woman. That would give Shire three female directors out of 11, meeting Lord Davies's target of 25% women directors . At the moment, with two women out of 11, Shire falls short. The number of women heading FTSE 100 companies has doubled - to 2 - with the appointment of Susan Kilsby as chair of Shire Updated at 11.53am GMT  10.02am GMT  Much chat about Rouhani's speech -- one delegate tells me "not bad, but he didn't want to recognise Israel". His comments about Syria didn't impress Huffington Post global news editor Peter Goodman . Rouhani at #WEF this hard to take: "Syria has been engulfed in a major catastrophe and the pplk have boren thr brunt." as if Iran bystander  9.51am GMT  US is growing well, China is moderating but will probably expand at over 7% a year, and even the eurozone is growing again, he says. But the US tapering needs to be handled carefully, and we need to create 30 million extra jobs just to fix the joblessness created since the financial crisis began.  9.50am GMT  Rouhani replies: All those who we have recognised inside this circle. We have had certain differences with certain countries... but we want to see a better future, and peace with all. (There is scattered applause.) Let me pick up on that last word, presses Klaus Schwab. All the world? Yes, all countries.. that we have officially recognised, Rouhani replies, smiling. That's the end of the session- Rouhani gets a decent round of applause again, despite ducking that last question. The issue of Iran's recognition of Israel is a hot topic at WEF - over the weekend, Benjamin Netanyahu said he might meet with Rouhani in Davos if Iran was prepared to recognise Israel . Updated at 11.53am GMT  9.42am GMT  Syria has been engulfed in a serious catastrophe, Rouhani says. Millions of innocent people have been killed, injured or made homeless. This cold winter ads to the misery. It is a miserable situation and very sad. Ruthless killers are flooding into Syria, he says, and fight - even fight each other. We should all work together to help Syria, and push these killers out of Syria. Then we must get the opposition around the table, and organise full and fair elections in Syria. A lot of humanitarian aid is being sent into Syria. Everyone should help the Syrians, to help them reach free and fair elections, Rouhani concludes. Updated at 11.53am GMT  9.38am GMT  40 countries have dual-use of nuclear technology, Rouhani replies - Iran will not accept being discriminated again.  9.37am GMT  On to questions -and Klaus Schwab asks president Rouhani what obstacles stand in the way of a comprehensive nuclear deal with Iran. Rouhani says he does not see any insurmountable hurdles. We have no ambition to create a nuclear weapon. But Iranian people are not prepared to give up their peaceful technology. We will continue to develop peaceful nuclear use. There could be a lack of serious will from other parties, he suggests. This is a long, difficult road, but if we push hard we can reach a comprehensive deal that will benefit us all, he concludes. Updated at 11.54am GMT  9.34am GMT  President Rouhani sums up by saying he wants to engage with the world community. He gets a respectful round of applause from the room.  9.33am GMT  Onto the issue of oil, and Rouhani says he met with the bosses of major oil firms this morning to discuss how the energy resource of the Islamic Republic of Iran could be used in a "framework of mutual interests". Energy can be a key factor in promising peace, he adds.  9.30am GMT  We will contribute to globalisation through the implementation of universal ethics, pledges Rouhani. I believe in engaging with the world community in a fair basis.  9.29am GMT  On the recent nuclear deal agreed between Iran and major powers, Rouhani insists that: What we have agreed is not a temporary position, but a prelude to a lasting resolution.  9.27am GMT  I strongly declare that nuclear weapons have no place in our security strategy, declares the Iranian president. We have no plans in that direction, Rouhani adds.  9.26am GMT  The security of the Middle East cannot be achieved by ignoring its people - we must create hope among its young people. And if we want everyone to contribute to security, everyone must feel secure. If some actors are excluded from the world community for some reason, everyone will suffer. It is important that all countries are involved. Now Rouhani tells Davos that sanctions "merely exacerbate" instability, rather than creating peace.  9.24am GMT  Onto geopolitics, and Rouhani says that he comes from a region that is currently, unfortunately, in flames. On terrorism, he calls it a fire that will engulf those who commit it. The key to fighting terrorism is economic development.  9.23am GMT  On trade, Rouhani says he aims to build stronger trade links with its neighbours - reeling off a list including Russia and Turkey - and to achieve normalised relations with Europe (updated). Updated at 10.52am GMT  9.22am GMT  The key to peace in the Middle East is to achieve economic growth, Rouhani says. And he also warns delegates that "Economics without ethics" will cause major damage to humanity in the long run.  9.19am GMT  Rouhani is telling WEF that his goal is to build closer ties with the rest of the world. We will use active foreign policy to boost economic development.  9.18am GMT  Let me be clear, says Rouhani: I see Iran's economy as the most congruent, capable, and most close to successful economies, and I see its place alongside them in future. I was elected with a magnate to persuade economic development, democracy. Updated at 11.18am GMT  9.17am GMT  The Koran has taught us that only those systems which serve the people will survive, explains Rouhani. That chimes strongly with the message which the pope sent to Davos. Updated at 9.21am GMT  9.16am GMT  The last six years have taught us that no country can succeed alone. No country can regard its dominance as permanent. And we are all linked through globalisation. If we do not choose wise captains then the storm will claim us all, Rouhani said.  9.14am GMT  Now, Iranians are rightfully demanding the implementation of this vision of prudence and hope, Rouhani says.  9.14am GMT  My view is one of prudent moderation - based on Islam. That is why I entered Iranian politics. It is the secret to Iran's success through history.  9.13am GMT  Rouhani says he's pleased to be here -believes the WEF can help improve the world's management. I am here to convey my people's message of friendship, peace, and co-operation.  9.12am GMT  The world needs to hear Rouhani's long-term vision for Iran, Schwab adds. Gosh it's tense in here!  9.11am GMT  Klaus Schwab, founder of WEF, is introducing president Rouhani now. He says compromises will be needed from all sides to improve the situation in the Middle East at this time of enormous change.  9.02am GMT  Excitement in building in Davos as Hassan Rouhani's special address is about to begin, in about 10 minutes time. It's being streamed live here . Updated at 9.03am GMT  8.54am GMT  It's a big day for purchasing manager indexes (PMIs), which measure activity at private sector companies. Overnight, HSBC's Chinese PMI showed the country's manufacturing sector contracting. Here's some of AP's report: The preliminary version of HSBC's purchasing managers' index dipped to 49.6 this month from December's 50.5 reading. It's the lowest reading since July's 47.7. The index is based on a 100-point scale on which numbers above 50 indicate expansion. The report on China's massive manufacturing industry adds to recent signs that the world's second-biggest economy is decelerating, adding to pressure on China's communist leaders who want to bring in sweeping reforms while keeping growth ticking along. We've also had Germany's PMI figures, which came in better than expected. Here's a tweet from CMC's Michael Hewson. Later this morning we'll get the CBI's distributive trades survey for the UK. German Manufacturing PMI (Jan) comes in at 56.3, Services PMI comes in at 53.6 Updated at 11.54am GMT  8.51am GMT  The U2 singer's campaign organisation One is trying to ensure that Western extractives companies (such as oil firms) are transparent in their dealings with developing countries. The idea is to root out corruption, he explained to Larry Elliott . Bono said he thought talks with Japan's PM Shinzo Abe went well but is less happy with how things has been going in the US where there has been major push back by the energy sector against new legislation. He fumed: "The API [American Petroleum Institute] has sued the SEC and won." He's right - last September a US court blocked a rule requiring mining companies to disclose payments they make to US and foreign governments.  8.43am GMT  Sir Roger Carr , one of Britain's most experienced businessmen, has also touched on the fears over conflict breaking out between China and Japan ( see earlier post ). Carr, recently named as chairman of BAE Systems, warned that the World Economic Forum does not have a great forecasting record. He told Bloomberg TV: I think you look back and you see that very often the topics we thought of that time to be critical are not a year later when we reflect on. I think where we are at the moment is a position where we have moved from being concerned about crisis to concern about managing recovery and the mindset is different. But I do think your point about the geopolitical risk also starts to be different. And as Iran seems to be moving a little closer to being part of the community, which is good news. Then you look further into the area of Japan and China and some concerns are developing there. Like always with the world it’s never stable. And we have to recognize that. This year, WEF identified wealth inequality and unemployment as key threats to the global economy, arguably several years too late. Updated at 11.54am GMT  8.32am GMT  Sustainability is another big theme at Davos this week, with delegates discussing important issues such as climate change, resource management, and water management. Our colleagues Jo Confino and Caroline Holtum are covering the action in another liveblog here:  8.23am GMT  A running theme of this year's Davos is whether we're facing a repeat of 1914, when leaders didn't realise until too late that the world was heading towards a huge military conflict. Japanese PM Shinzo Abe put the issue firmly on the agenda last night - sending a shiver through the Congress hall as he warned that military expansion in Asia could run out of control unless checked. Abe's comments are being interpreted as an appeal for support from leaders here in its dispute with China over islands in the East China Sea. Economist Nouriel Roubini tweets that many speakers at Davos are making comparisons with 1914 -- pointing out that then, like today, wealth inequality was high. #wef14 many speakers compare 2014 to 1914 when WWI broke out & no one expected it. A black swan in the form of a war between China & Japan? #wef14 Echoes of 1914: backlash against globalization, gilded age of inequality, rising geopolitical tensions, ignoring tail risks @Nouriel Roubini @davos last night compared 2014 to 1914 referring to China-Japan relationships. Scary. #wef14 Updated at 11.54am GMT  8.20am GMT  United Carpets and Floors2go have promised to clean up their acts when it comes to deals they advertise to customers. The Office of Fair Trading said United Carpets has pledged to make sure its advertised recommened retail prices are genuine. The company is also going to be more careful when it claims to hold a sale when a store is "closing down" or "closing for refurbishment". The OFT announced an inquiry into carpet and furnishings retailers last year because it suspected claims of sales and reductions weren't always genuine. The regulator said United Carpets was no longer part of the investigation. Floors2go owner Nixon & Hope has agreed to change its practices after the OFT found that it was advertising prices online that excluded VAT. The regulator was also unhappy that some claimed savings for customers weren't genuine. Gaucho Rasmussen, the OFT's goods and consumer director, said: When retailers advertise misleading prices or promotions, consumers often make different purchases - or spend more money - than they otherwise might have done. We therefore welcome the changes that United Carpets and Nixon & Hope have made, and agreed to make, to their pricing and marketing strategies.

We have spent the last few years talking about the need to rebalance the economy away from a focus on property and financial services and towards investment and exports.

Updated at 10.27am GMT  8.11am GMT  In London, Pearson shares have tumbled more than 8% in early trading after the education publisher published a profit warning . Earnings per share after restructuring costs will be lower than the company expected. Pearson, which also owns the Financial Times and the Economist, said it had a tough time last year. In the US, its biggest market, business was affected by tight state education budgets, lower enrolment in higher education and the adoption by most states of common core standards. It suffered problems in the UK, too. Higher restructuring costs will push annual earnings per share after those costs to about 70p, compared with consensus forecasts of about 76p. The statement was published ahead of annual results scheduled for 28 February. The message from the company was that it will cut more costs and increase its efforts in emerging markets, where business is much better. John Fallon, Pearson's chief executive, said: Pearson made good progress on our strategic goals in 2013 but our trading and financial performance has been weaker than expected, particularly in North America. With trading conditions still challenging in 2014, this further underlines the importance of the work we started in 2013 to reduce our established cost base and redirect our investment towards our biggest future growth opportunities. We will accelerate this transformation in 2014 and remain confident about our growth prospects in 2015 and beyond.

King warned: "The question is whether low inflation will prevent the recovery being sustained." Adair Turner, the former head of the FSA, is also breaking bread with HSBC -- he said low inflation was the result of the overhang of debt and it was a surprise that deflationary fears had not surfaced earlier. Turner says he expects the European Central Bank will resort to further "exceptional measures"to counter deflation within the next year. He warned: "For several decades before the crisis on average annual growth in credit was faster than growth in nominal GDP and leverage went up. Somewhere there is a limit to that and it was reached in 2008.

"Jason Rezaian caught in feud between President Rouhani and Iran hardliners","Hardliners accuse Washington Post reporter of accessing sensitive information but moderates say Rezaian is the victim of an effort to smear the government  Saeed Kamali Dehghan in London and  Lauren Gambino in Los Angeles  Wed 18 Mar 2015 12.49 GMT   Last modified on Fri 14 Jul 2017 22.20 BST   Jason Rezaian, the Washington Post reporter detained in Iran for nearly eight months, is the victim of internal rivalries between powerful senior figures in the Islamic republic, with hardliners accusing him of gaining privileged access to information through the nephew of the country’s president, Hassan Rouhani. The Iranian intelligence authorities have been trying to build a case against Rezaian in an effort to undermine Rouhani’s moderate administration, which favours better relations with the west, the Guardian has learned. Hardliners have claimed that the Iranian-American reporter had access to sensitive information through contacts with Rouhani’s nephew, Esmail Samavi, who works for the president’s office as a public relations manager. Rezaian’s family say the allegations are unfounded. “If they [the Iranian intelligence authorities] are trying to go after the Rouhani family, then they’ve held the wrong person for eight months,” said Jason’s brother, Ali, the family spokesman. Ali said his brother did not have a relationship – personal or professional – with a member of the president’s family. “Jason has never had any direct communication with anyone in the Rouhani family,” he said. “He wasn’t friends with anyone in the Rouhani family. He wasn’t associates with anyone in the family. He wasn’t even in contact with anyone in the family.” Rezaian was detained in July 2014 after security forces raided his home in Tehran and arrested him, his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, also a journalist, and two friends, an Iranian-American couple with close ties to Rouhani’s family. After those arrests, opposition sources reported that security officials had also sought to arrest Samavi in connection with Rezaian’s case but did not succeed because of his high-profile role in the presidential office. The Iranian-American couple were released shortly after their arrest, and Salehi was released on bail in October, but Rezaian has been held ever since. Several sources, speaking to the Guardian, confirmed Rezaian has become caught up in the high-level feud between Rouhani’s government and its internal opponents. Rezaian, has been kept incommunicado for the most of his time in jail with little access to his lawyers and family. He was finally charged in December , but the exact nature of the changes has still not been made public. Last month, Hamid Rasaei, an influential hardline MP said in a statement published on his website that Rezaian had been accused of espionage, and told reporters in Tehran that Rezaian had made a full confession on camera. “Under the cover of their work as reporters, Jason Rezaian and his wife infiltrated some of the most sensitive places at the president’s office,” Rasaei wrote. “Which individual helped Jason Rezaian bypass security barriers and gain access to materials for espionage?” the parliamentarian asked before hinting that he was referring to Samavi, whom he referred to only by his initials. “Who is preventing ES, who is a manager in the president’s office, from being called in for questioning?” Omid Memarian, an Iranian journalist based in New York and a friend of the Washington Post reporter, said Rezaian had never met Samavi. He said the Rezaian was permitted to attend a press conference at the president’s office just once during his eight years reporting in Iran , and he wasn’t allowed to ask any questions. Rezaian was also permitted to accompany Rouhani during a provincial visit last year, but Memarian said he was not on the president’s plane and did not have privileged access. “It is quite clear from Rasaei’s remarks that the reasons for the arrest, the interrogations, and the forced confessions were all centred around building a case against Hassan Rouhani’s nephew,” Memarian told the Guardian. “Jason is a victim of the competition between different Iranian intelligence organisations, and a fabricated case against the president’s nephew. But Hassan Rouhani has preferred to maintain complete silence in this regard.” Memarian added: “I believe it is shameful that almost everyone inside Iran’s foreign ministry and the president’s office knows that Jason’s arrest was made to make a case against Rouhani’s nephew, and they have still kept silent during all this time.” In 2003, Memarian was himself put in prison in Iran and coerced into making a false confession, a familiar tactic used against those held on political grounds. “Weeks of solitary confinement and psychological and physical torture eventually made me give in to demands of those who had arrested me,” he said. “In a similar position, after months of brutal solitary confinement, Jason is forced to give in to the demands of those who arrested him and confessing to things that anyone who knows him at all knows to be fabricated crimes.” Rezaian’s detention is complicated by the fact that Iran does not recognise dual citizenship, and treats him solely as an Iranian. As a result, Rezaian has not had consular access through the Swiss embassy, which acts on behalf of American citizens in Iran because the US does not have diplomatic relations with the country. Iranian intelligence authorities are deeply suspicious of dual citizens and have arrested a number of them in recent years on accusations of spying for foreign countries. Rouhani is loathed by hardliners because of his efforts to create greater social freedoms at home and engage with the international community. They believe his administration is giving away too much for too little in the current nuclear negotiations. Hardliners also accuse Rouhani of nepotism. The president’s brother, Hossein Fereydoun, also works for him as his special adviser and is currently involved in the nuclear talks with the world’s major powers. Iran’s judiciary, which is dominated by conservatives, acts independently of Rouhani’s government, meaning that the president’s influence on such cases in limited. But Rouhani can still use his position as the public face of the Islamic republic to defend Rezaian, which he has refrained from doing, at least so far. Rezaian’s family and the Washington Post have recently stepped up their calls for his release , expressing deep concern that Rezaian’s case is now being reviewed by a hardline judge, Abolghassem Salavati, who has a record of handing down heavy sentences on similar cases. At a press conference last week, Ali Rezaian said he appealed to the government in Tehran to release his brother on bail for, Nowruz, the Persian new year, which begins on 21 March. “It’s a time for new beginnings,” Ali said, speaking at a press conference in Washington. “It’s a time for generosity and mercy.”"
"John Kerry breaks leg in cycling accident and scraps rest of four-stop Europe trip","Agencies in Geneva  Sun 31 May 2015 15.23 BST   First published on Sun 31 May 2015 11.03 BST   Secretary of State John Kerry broke his leg in bike crash near Scionzier in France on Sunday, apparently after hitting a curb. He then scrapped the rest of a four-nation trip that included an international conference on combating the Islamic State group. State Department spokesman John Kirby said X-rays at a Swiss hospital confirmed that Kerry fractured his right femur. “The secretary is stable and never lost consciousness, his injury is not life-threatening and he is expected to make a full recovery,” Kirby said in a statement. It was initially announced that Kerry, 71, would return to Boston for further treatment with a doctor who previously operated on his hip. Later on Sunday, Kirby said the planned return to the US would be delayed, as after further consultation it had been deemed sensible for the secretary to remain in hospital for observation overnight, for precautionary reasons. Kerry’s wish to seek treatment at Massachusetts General Hospital was made because the fracture is near the site of his prior hip surgery, Kirby said. Kerry, who on Saturday was in Geneva for six hours of meetings with Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif as the sides work to seal a comprehensive accord by 30 June, was in stable condition and in good spirits, Kirby said. Kerry was taken by helicopter to Geneva’s main medical centre, HUG, after apparently hitting a curb with his bike near Scionzier, France , about 25 miles (40km) southeast of the Swiss border. Paramedics and a physician were on the scene with Kerry’s motorcade at the time and provided immediate attention. They quickly decided to order the 10-minute-long helicopter transport. Kerry’s cycling rides have become a regular occurrence on his trips. He often takes his bike with him on the plane and was riding that bicycle on Sunday. During discussions in late March and early April between world powers and Iran, he took several bike trips during breaks. Those talks were in Lausanne, Switzerland , and led to a framework agreement. Kerry regrets not being able to make the rest of his scheduled stops, Kirby said. The top US diplomat had planned to travel later on Sunday to Madrid for meetings with Spain’s king and prime minister, before spending two days in Paris for an international gathering to combat Isis. He will participate in the Paris conference remotely, Kirby said."
"Clinton, Denouncing Trump, Calls Herself ‘Part of the Resistance’","Advertisement Supported by By  Alexander Burns Hillary Clinton on Tuesday sharply questioned President Trump’s conduct in office, criticizing his foreign policy pronouncements and penchant for posting on Twitter, and described herself as “part of the resistance.” During an interview with the CNN correspondent Christiane Amanpour, Mrs. Clinton, who has kept a relatively low profile since her defeat in the presidential race, repeatedly characterized Mr. Trump as struggling in the presidency. The interview was at an event hosted by Women for Women International, a nonprofit group, in Midtown Manhattan. Mrs. Clinton voiced disbelief at what she cast as the White House’s slapdash approach to issues like health care and the North Korean nuclear program. She repeatedly said that Mr. Trump did little to prepare for the presidency. And but for the actions of Russian-backed hackers and the F.B.I. in late October, Mrs. Clinton said, she would have won. “The reason why I believe we lost were the intervening events in the last 10 days,” she said, arguing that based on the available data: “If the election had been on Oct. 27, I’d be your president.” On foreign policy, Mrs. Clinton specifically criticized Mr. Trump’s suggestion in a television interview that he would be prepared to meet with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, mocking the comment as impulsive and naïve. North Korea, Mrs. Clinton said, has long tried to lure American leaders into direct contact “to elevate their status and their position, and we should be very careful about giving that away.” “You should not offer that in the absence of a broader strategic framework to try to get China, Japan, Russia, South Korea to put the kind of pressure on the regime that will finally bring them to the negotiating table,” she said, adding of direct talks: “They have to be part of a broader strategy, not just thrown up on a tweet some morning: ‘Hey, let’s get together, see if we can’t get along.’” Mrs. Clinton’s thorough rebuke of Mr. Trump, just after his administration passed the 100-day mark, was a remarkably blunt dressing-down of a new president by his adversary in the last election. Her remarks came amid a new wave of criticism of Mr. Trump from emboldened veterans of the last administration: Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. visited New Hampshire on Sunday to rally his party and castigate Republicans in Washington, and former President Barack Obama told attendees at a private event in New York last week that his signature health care law was now more popular than Mr. Trump , according to CNN. But Mrs. Clinton, as her party’s most recent standard-bearer, has a special status as an adversary of Mr. Trump. And while she described herself as merely a private citizen, she placed herself publicly on the side of the popular backlash against her former rival. In an almost casual aside, she effectively endorsed the explosion of activism on the left, in the language activists have embraced. “I’m back to being an active citizen,” Mrs. Clinton said, “and part of the resistance.” Throughout her remarks, she emphasized how intensively she had thought through her plans for governing, while she said Mr. Trump was plainly straining to fulfill his campaign promises. “Health care is complicated, and so is foreign policy and other stuff,” she said, drawing laughter and applause from a supportive audience. “If it’s easy, it doesn’t get to the president’s desk.” She also called on the administration not to cut international development initiatives, including aid programs aimed at supporting women. And she questioned whether the missile strikes Mr. Trump ordered in Syria would have a meaningful effect on the conflict there. Mrs. Clinton appeared to be enjoying herself as she served up crowd-pleasing lines in a dry and knowing tone. She won a loud ovation from the audience, which included the actress Meryl Streep, when she observed that Mr. Trump seemed irked by the fact that she had won the popular vote by several million ballots. The president, she said, “should worry less about the election and my winning the popular vote” and more about urgent matters of policy confronting the country. Pressed by Ms. Amanpour to reflect on the campaign, Mrs. Clinton said she took “absolute personal responsibility” for her defeat. But she said she believed she would have won if not for the actions of Russia and a surprise announcement in late October by James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, that the agency was conducting an additional review of emails linked to Mrs. Clinton. In pointed language, Mrs. Clinton said Mr. Trump seemed to be tightly aligned with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, whom American intelligence agencies believe ordered an extensive campaign aimed at influencing the 2016 race. “He certainly interfered in our election,” Mrs. Clinton said of Mr. Putin. “And clearly interfered to hurt me and to help my opponent.” Mrs. Clinton said that if you “chart my opponent and his campaign’s statements,” they appear “quite coordinated with the goals of that leader, who shall remain nameless.” In another jab at Mr. Trump’s policies, Mrs. Clinton pointed out that she had criticized Mr. Putin for conducting “rigged” elections during her tenure as secretary of state. In an apparent allusion to the Trump administration’s lack of interest in human rights issues, Mrs. Clinton said that for secretaries of state, chastising strongman tactics “kind of goes with the territory — at least, it did.” Mrs. Clinton, who said she believed sexism also played a role in the 2016 campaign, promised she would offer a fuller reflection on it in a book next fall. She said she was working on the manuscript. “It’s a painful process, reliving the campaign,” she said. Advertisement"
"A New Kind of Warfare","Advertisement SEPT. 9, 2012  Cybersecurity efforts in the United States have largely centered on defending computer networks against attacks by hackers, criminals and foreign governments, mainly China . Increasingly, however, the focus is on developing offensive capabilities, on figuring out how and when the United States might unleash its own malware to disrupt an adversary’s networks. That is potentially dangerous territory. Such malware is believed to have little deterrent value against criminals who use computers to steal money from banks or spies who pilfer industrial secrets. But faced with rising intrusions against computers that run America’s military systems and its essential infrastructure — its power grid, for instance, and its telecommunications networks — the military here (and elsewhere) sees disruptive software as an essential new tool of war. According to a study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies , the 15 countries with the biggest military budgets are all investing in offensive cyber capabilities. The latest step occurred last month when the United States sent out bids for technologies “to destroy, deny, degrade, disrupt, corrupt or usurp” an adversary’s attempt to use cyberspace for advantage. The Air Force asked for proposals to plan for and manage cyberwarfare , including the ability to launch superfast computer attacks and withstand retaliation. The United States, China, Russia , Britain and Israel began developing basic cyberattack capabilities at least a decade ago and are still figuring out how to integrate them into their military operations. Experts say cyberweapons will be used before or during conflicts involving conventional weapons to infect an adversary’s network and disrupt a target, including shutting down military communications. The most prominent example is the Stuxnet virus deployed in 2010 by the United States and Israel to set back Iran’s nuclear program . Other cyberattacks occurred in 2007 against Syria and 1998 against Serbia . Crucial questions remain unanswered, including what laws of war would apply to decisions to launch an attack. The United States still hasn’t figured out what impact cyberweapons could have on actual battlefield operations or when an aggressive cyber response is required. Nor has Washington settled on who would authorize an attack; experts see roles for both the president and military commanders. There is also the unresolved issue of how to minimize collateral damage — like making sure malware does not cripple a civilian hospital. Another big concern is China, which is blamed for stealing American military secrets. Washington has not had much success persuading Beijing to rein in its hackers. There is a serious risk of miscalculation if, for example, there is a confrontation in the South China Sea. China could misinterpret a move, unleash a cyberattack and trigger a real cyberwar. What’s clearly needed are new international understandings about what constitutes cyber aggression and how governments should respond. Meanwhile, the United States must do what it can to protect its own networks.

"The deferred promise of Islamic-world science","Ten years ago, there was excitement about the prospects for science and innovation across the Islamic world. Was this optimism misplaced?  Ehsan Masood and  James Wilsdon  Thu 16 Nov 2017 07.00 GMT   Last modified on Fri 17 Nov 2017 16.03 GMT   L ast week, almost 3,000 scientists and policymakers from 120 countries gathered on the shores of the Dead Sea in Jordan for the 2017 World Science Forum . It was a landmark moment for Jordanian science, and a tribute to the vision of Princess Sumaya bint El Hassan , president of Jordan’s Royal Scientific Society, who is in the vanguard of a new generation of leaders championing science and innovation in the region. Jordan is also home to the Middle East’s first advanced light source facility – the Synchrotron-Light for Experimental Science and Applications, or Sesame – which was inaugurated earlier this year as a shared resource for researchers from  Cyprus, Egypt, Iran, Israel, Jordan, Pakistan, the Palestinian Authority and Turkey. In its final declaration , the World Science Forum called for more scientific cooperation to promote peace and address regional challenges. But the meeting also provided an opportunity to take stock of the state of science across the Middle East and wider Islamic world. And while the symbolism of the Sesame project was rightly celebrated, there was little of the outright optimism that characterised these debates ten or fifteen years ago. In the early 2000s, several member states of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) embarked on a concerted drive to improve their science and innovation performance: primarily the oil and gas-rich Gulf economies, but also Egypt, Malaysia, Pakistan and Turkey. This gave rise to expectations of an overall strengthening of science and innovation across the Islamic world. To complement efforts at a national level, in 2003, the OIC adopted a new policy framework – Vision 1441 – for the contribution of science and innovation to economic and social progress across its fifty-seven member states. The year 1441 in the Islamic (Hijri) calendar equates to 2020 in the Gregorian calendar, and Vision 1441 includes several targets for OIC countries by this date: to produce 14% of the world’s scientific output; to train 1441 scientists or engineers per million of population; and to invest at least 1.4% of GDP in research and development (R&D). Combined with the opening of new universities and marked increases in R&D spending in several OIC countries, Vision 1441 generated a sense of optimism among science and innovation policymakers, which was well captured by a 2006 special issue of the journal Nature on Islam and Science . Shortly afterwards, Nature entered into a partnership with the OIC, Qatar Foundation, the UK’s Royal Society , Canada’s International Development Research Centre (IDRC) and the British Council to research these issues in more depth, through an Atlas of Islamic World Science and Innovation . This was an ambitious series of reports aimed at mapping the research and innovation systems of a selection of OIC countries, in order to better understand strengths, weaknesses and future potential across the Islamic world. The Atlas project, which we both contributed to, was set up to help OIC countries identify what they could do better, and where they might collaborate. Perhaps the most glaring indicator was the fact that several of the world’s richest nations, within the OIC, spent less as a fraction of national wealth on knowledge and scholarship than many of the poorest - an average of just 0.5% of GDP. Of many individual contributions from that period, one by Pervez Hoodbhoy , a prominent physicist from Pakistan, stands out. In a 2007 article , Hoodbhoy asked: “With well over a billion Muslims and extensive material resources, why is the Islamic world disengaged from science and the process of creating new knowledge?” But he ended on a more upbeat note: “Science can prosper among Muslims once again, but only with a willingness to accept certain basic philosophical and attitudinal changes – a Weltanschauung that shrugs off the dead hand of tradition, rejects fatalism and absolute belief in authority, accepts the legitimacy of temporal laws, values intellectual rigour and scientific honesty, and respects cultural and personal freedoms.” So ten years ago, policymakers, university and research leaders were cautiously positive in envisaging a transition in science and innovation performance across the Islamic world, despite persistent challenges. Then came the Arab revolutions of 2011 . Few anticipated that the Middle East would come alive with the voices of young people demanding a say in how they are governed; a movement that was fuelled in part by poor educational opportunities and high youth unemployment. These revolutions initially provided further cause for optimism. At the launch of the Atlas project report for Egypt in April 2012, we witnessed the rare spectacle of a government minister being grilled by a packed audience of students and young people. “How come you still have a job?” piped one. “What will you do to improve my job prospects,” asked another. Such was the changed dynamic that the minister had no choice but to engage with his youthful critics. But amid the talk of paradigm shifts, as we know now, many brave women and men were crushed, often brutally, as existing regimes sought to reassert control. With the exception of Tunisia , their cries for freedom have largely fallen silent. And the subsequent rise of ISIS meant that many regimes parked other priorities – including science – in favour of spending on security, defence and deradicalisation. Alongside the return to a form of status quo, individual initiatives have continued to proliferate. Most significant has been the slow thaw in relations between Iran and the west, largely brought about by the efforts of the Obama administration and counterparts in the European Union. Few will forget the beaming smiles and handshakes as the nuclear deal was inked – in many respects, a triumph of science diplomacy . What the US perhaps did not realise (or chose to set aside) is the extent to which Iran was simultaneously ramping up its regional influence in scientific and other domains. One visible demonstration of this was a new Mustafa Prize for scientific excellence, intended to rival Saudi Arabia’s longstanding King Faisal prizes . This move was not lost on representatives of the Gulf states, most of which chose to respond to an invitation to the 2015 prize ceremony in Tehran by boycotting it. A further earthquake in regional politics was to follow with the elevation of Saudi defence minister Mohammad bin Salman as crown prince and de facto prime minister. The prince, though a liberalising force in Saudi society , regards Iran as Saudi Arabia’s principle regional threat. Under Salman’s leadership, in its most aggressive foreign and defence policy of recent times, Saudi Arabia is fighting Iran-backed fighters in Yemen and has coordinated an air, land and sea blockade around neighbouring Qatar , which it accuses among other things of being too Iran-friendly. Saudi Arabia also appears to have engineered the sudden resignation of Lebanon’s prime minister Saad Hariri, where Iran-backed Hezbollah is a strong political force. Amid this regional turmoil, the science institutions of the OIC are soldiering bravely on, hosting their latest science and innovation summit in September 2017. One of the OIC science agencies, Comstech , has an energetic director general in the Pakistani nuclear physicist Shaukat Hameed Khan . He is fond of reminding the leaders of OIC member states that “science is disruptive and flourishes in an environment of irreverence”. Khan has a plan to create a network of scientific observatories (there are none of note in the Islamic world), and is confident that funding can be found. Meanwhile, at the Islamic Development Bank , the Saudi bioscientist and entrepreneur Hayat Sindi was appointed in April this year to a new advisory position, and has been tasked with reviewing the bank’s R&D funding and investments. And a taskforce , chaired by Zakri Abdul Hamid, science adviser to the prime minister of Malaysia, recently issued a call for universities across the Muslim world to create a voluntary network of excellence. At the bilateral level, funding schemes such as the UK’s Newton Fund are proving a useful vehicle for deepening scientific links with OIC countries such as Egypt, Indonesia, Jordan, Malaysia and Turkey. And on the multilateral plane, initiatives such as the World Science Forum , the Inter-Academy Panel , the World Academy of Sciences are important fora where OIC states can meet and work with each other under the umbrella of a neutral third party – or direct scientific efforts towards the less contentious UN Sustainable Development Goals . A decade ago, it seemed reasonable to take the OIC at its word – that it is a body capable of coordinating and bringing the best out of its disparate and diverse member states. With the luxury of hindsight, that assumption appears naïve. Within individual OIC member states and its collective institutions, there are numerous individuals desperate to bury ancient rivalries and work towards a common good. But at the highest levels of political leadership, the desire to cling onto power is now so evident that genuine pan-OIC cooperation looks further away than ever. In the opening session of last week’s World Science Forum, Ireland’s chief scientific adviser Mark Ferguson made a poignant observation on the forum’s theme of “Science for Peace”. Science, he reminded the audience, cannot be the primary vehicle for peace in an environment where there are deep-rooted reasons for conflict. Science can reap the dividends, he argued, but “it cannot make the peace”. Right now, the nations of the OIC are heading towards what could be the defining crisis since the organisation’s foundation in 1969. Some would argue that the current battle between Sunni and Shiite groups, and their client states (Saudi Arabia and Iran), is an intractable conflict. We don’t subscribe to this view, but there is little doubt that wiser heads must prevail. Many opportunities to strengthen knowledge, learning and scholarship across the Islamic world exist independently of the OIC. Yet more effective and collective political leadership is crucial. Without it, the promise of an Islamic-world renaissance in science will forever remain a topic for history books."
"The Edge: Is the Military Dominance of the West Coming to an End? by Mark Urban – review","Fri 17 Apr 2015 10.00 BST   Last modified on Wed 29 Nov 2017 11.51 GMT   T his is a kind of wake-up call. As defence budgets in the west, including the US and UK, are being cut by governments confronted by austerity or war weariness – what Peter Wall, the former head of the army, has called “moral disarmament” – Vladimir Putin is modernising Russia’s ageing arsenal in a hugely expensive and ambitious programme, while China, India, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states (to the delight of British arms companies) are increasing the amount spent on weapons to record levels. Mark Urban is the BBC’s respected diplomatic and defence journalist and a military historian, and his book asks “Is the Military Dominance of the West Coming to an End?”. The answer is: “Yes, of course.” That is, in the way the west’s conventional weapons have in the past been vastly superior to those of Russia , India, China and other Asian powers. Now, warns Urban, projected cuts “will make it impossible for America to have the kind of military reach it used to”. Many Americans, he adds, “do not realise that the age of a single global hyperpower is over. And, actually, it’s worse than that. For it is only by combining metrics of that decline with the growth in military capabilities elsewhere that you can gain a sense of how quickly the scales are tipping”. Now, says Urban, Russia, China and India have such strong conventional forces, and America has cut its forces so much, that in the event of a conflict “the US would be left with the choice of nuclear escalation or backing down”. He adds: “Against a full-scale invasion of South Korea, the US would have little choice but to go nuclear.” Russia, China , India, Israel, Pakistan, North Korea and some other countries could “mount a credible conventional defence that would leave the United States having to think the unthinkable, with profound implications for the world”. Would the US really need to contemplate a nuclear attack on these countries? Urban does not really answer the question. More convincingly, he talks about the dangers of nuclear proliferation and nuclear blackmail at a time when Russia and China are reverting to the notion of “spheres of influence” and when, as he puts it, the idea that political power grows from the barrel of a gun is back with a vengeance in many parts of the world. “A growing threat to world order,” says Urban, will ultimately lead to more countries acquiring nuclear weapons, as well as chemical and biological weapons, and what he calls “cyber weaponry”. What is missing here is an alternative scenario. Public opinion, and therefore governments, in the west may have lost the will to pay for and deploy substantial conventional forces, but there are options other than amassing tanks or the dangerous reliance on the doctrine of MAD (mutual assured destruction). There are many alternatives to conventional or nuclear warfare, including “hybrid warfare”, the combination of special forces, subversion, cyber- attacks and psychological warfare of the kind used by Russia in eastern Ukraine, and, indeed, by Isis in Syria and northern Iraq. Alex Younger, the new chief of MI6, warned in his first public speech last month of a “technology arms race”, meaning the use of the internet to attack the enemy. The west, very much including Britain, has been extremely slow in responding to the new threats. While British government ministers indulged in rhetoric directed at the Kremlin or Syria’s president, Bashar al‑Assad , they and their military advisers were slow to invest in drones, slow to understand what Putin was up to in Ukraine, and slow to foresee how Sunni resentment would encourage extreme jihadism. British defence chiefs complain about cuts in their budget, yet the budget is skewed by devoting tens of billions of pounds to prestige projects whose relevance and effectiveness is highly questionable. Under present plans, a quarter of Britain’s defence equipment over the next decade will be devoted to a new fleet of Trident ballistic missile submarines and their nuclear weapons. More will be spent on two new aircraft carriers, equipped with an unknown number of US F-35 jets, whose price continues to soar and which are exposed to potential attack because the navy has not got enough surface ships to protect them. Meanwhile, the former chief of defence staff, David Richards, has pointed out: “We have £1bn destroyers trying to sort out pirates in a little dhow with RPGs” – rocket-propelled grenades – “costing $50m, and with an outboard motor, $100m.” Urban says his purpose is to “show how rapidly the global balance of power is shifting away from the west”. But is it shifting towards Moscow? Jonathan Eyal of the Royal United Services Institute says we are likely to see two proxy wars in Europe, one played out in Ukraine, the other with both Nato and the EU. He adds: “In the longer term, the Russians are likely to lose both confrontations, as they have lost all previous ones, and for the same reason: they cannot match military with economic power.” Does China really have an interest in starting a global arms race? Do not nation states have a common interest in defeating a common enemy – extreme, violent, religious or ideologically driven groups intent on spreading terror? Urban might have explored these questions further, including the implications of the west’s economic dominance coming to an end. Military dominance depends, after all, on the ability to pay for it. But he is absolutely right to flag up the continuing threats and dangers posed by nuclear weapons and their proliferation at a time when Saudi Arabia, worried about Shia Iran’s growing influence in the Middle East, is threatening to arm itself with them, when a weak Pakistan is developing battlefield nuclear weapons, and when Putin, however weak his country’s economy, brandishes Russia’s arsenal of tactical nuclear weapons. The framework deal with Iran may be a good omen but The Edge remains a timely warning. The key is effective and realistic deterrence, to assure those who are vulnerable and dissuade those who threaten. This is a neglected but vitally important contemporary conundrum. Yet despite the row over Trident it is unlikely to get much of a look-in during Britain’s general election campaign. •  To order  The Edge  for £9.99 (RRP £12.99) go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0330 333 6846.

"Pakistan’s Nuclear Scenarios, U.S. Solutions","Updated, May 6, 5:15 p.m. | Bruce Riedel, who was chairman of President Obamaâs strategic review of United States policy toward Afghanistan and Pakistan earlier this year, says that, while not inevitable, a jihadist state in Pakistan is a real possibility. Updated, May 6, 11:15 a.m. | Michael E. O’Hanlon of the Brookings Institution offers his views on a pre-emptive strike against Pakistan’s nuclear weapons. As the Pakistani military launched a new offensive against the Taliban in the country’s North-West Frontier Province,  officials and former officials in Washington continued to discuss what the American response should be to the heightened conflict. How should the United States respond? And how secure are Pakistan’s nuclear weapons? Just before her murder in December 2007 former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said, âI now think Al Qaeda can be marching on Islamabad in two to four years.â  Today her prophecy seems all too real. Al Qaedaâs allies in Pakistan, the Taliban, Lashkar e Tayyba, and other extreme jihadists, are becoming increasingly powerful.  They are no longer confined to the tribal belt along the Afghan border but have built strong bases of support in the nationâs heartland, the Punjab, and in the major cities.  The mayor of Karachi, a mega city of 18 million, tells me the Taliban alliance is now threatening to take over his city, the countryâs only major port and NATOâs logistical supply line for the war in Afghanistan.  A jihadist state in Pakistan is neither imminent nor inevitable, it may not be likely, but it is a real possibility. A jihadist Pakistan would be a strategic nightmare for America, south Asia and the world.  It would provide al Qaeda and other terrorist groups with the ultimate sanctuary in the worldsâ second largest Muslim state, protected by nuclear weapons, with a global diplomatic presence and Pakistani Diaspora that could be used to support terror.  A jihadist takeover would make the NATO mission in Afghanistan increasingly untenable.  It would be a direct threat to both Hindu India and Shia Iran, encouraging both to expand and accelerate their own nuclear programs. Thus it is critical that the United States do what it can now to strengthen the Pakistani moderate center which is resisting the jihadist Frankenstein.  Congress should pass the Kerry-Lugar legislation that triples economic aid and the Pentagonâs proposals for increasing counter-insurgency assistance to Pakistan with a minimum of conditionality. Trying to legislate changes in Pakistani behavior is a recipe for disaster — as the history of U.S.-Pakistan relations demonstrates — now is the time to support Pakistanis who are ready to resist extremism and jihadism. Pakistani nuclear weapons fall under the control of the military, which is the most professional, disciplined and competent institution in the country.  It takes nuclear security extremely seriously, and will surely adopt heightened measures to protect these weapons. That said, authorities in every country possessing nuclear weapons worry about the possibility of insiders who are willing to assist terrorists steal a weapon or gain access to facilities containing nuclear weapons and materials. The United States, for example, has invested considerable resources in measures to prevent terrorists from recruiting people at nuclear sites. But the U.S. does not have to secure nuclear weapons and materials amid rising extremism and instability in the country.  No matter how assuring Pakistani authorities may sound publicly, one hopes they are quietly preparing to face possible sudden and unanticipated challenges to their control over nuclear weapons and facilities. They face two fundamental problems in this regard. First, there is no such thing as perfect security: the loss of one weapon or takeover of one nuclear facility would precipitate a crisis. The chain of security across a dispersed line of nuclear assets is only as strong as its weakest link. The risk is that extremists collaborating with insiders are able to seize an opportunity to exploit a lapse in the defenses. Second, the insider threat is not theoretical. Twice since the 9/11 attacks, the U.S. taken action to break up networks inside Pakistan’s nuclear establishment who were collaborating with outsiders in efforts to help them build bombs. In both cases, rogue senior officials and their cohorts in the nuclear establishment were not caught by Pakistan’s military, security and intelligence establishment. The network run by the father of the Pakistani bomb, Abdul Qadeer Khan , channeled sensitive nuclear technologies to Libya, North Korea and Iran for years under the noses of the Pakistani establishment, before it was taken down in 2003. The second case involved the Umma-Tameer-E-Nau, which was founded by Pakistani nuclear scientists with close ties to Al Qaeda and the Taliban. It was headed by Bashiruddin Mahmood, a retired senior Pakistan Atomic Energy Agency official who had headed Pakistan’s Khushab Atomic Reactor. He discussed Al Qaeda’s nuclear aspirations with Osama bin Laden. In assuring the security of nuclear weapons in Pakistan, we should remind ourselves that the insider threat is the key wild card. The record is troubling, especially when one considers the probable outcome had the U.S. not intervened as it did to neutralize threats as they became known. The next time a nuclear threat emerges, will Pakistani authorities catch it in time? The U.S. should do everything in its power to ensure they can. Nuclear terrorism is not just a problem for Pakistan and the region. Terrorist acquisition and movement of nuclear materials represents a real and growing global threat, because the detonation of one nuclear bomb in any city in the world would change the course of history. A Taliban and Al Qaeda takeover of Pakistan, along with its nuclear arsenal, pose the worst-case scenario for Western policymakers and far too many Pakistanis. But two other, less extreme scenarios also cause serious concern. The first would be yet another military coup, potentially led by junior officers with sympathy for the Islamist militants.  Many of these junior officers are largely unknown to their counterparts in the West, unlike the senior military officers. This lack of familiarity is the result of U.S. sanctions  placed on Pakistan between the end of the Cold War and Sept. 11, 2001, moves that were intended to punish the country for its nuclear program and, later, for a military coup. The second nightmare scenario would be continued state disintegration, resulting in competing militias, terrorist groups and criminal gangs in charge of most of Pakistanâs provinces and territories, with the government exercising only nominal control over parts of the capital city and â maybe â some of the nuclear weapons. Any of these formulations will have direct and enormous consequences not only for the people and governments in the greater South Asia region — home to nearly half the worldâs population and several nuclear-armed states â but also further afield in Europe and North America. In contrast, the best case scenario would be a full embrace by the Pakistani security forces of counter-insurgency doctrine â- notably protection of the civilian population, improved delivery of social services and successful application of the rule of law â- along with much-needed political and economic reforms throughout the country. What should the United States and its allies do to help move the country in the right direction?  While the top levels of the U.S. government â- in both the military and civilian spheres â- are already working very closely with their counterparts in Pakistan and in the region, greater efforts also need to be made to align the Pakistani people with their own government and these external efforts. In Pakistan (and to a degree in Afghanistan), too many citizens still think they are being asked to fight Americaâs war, and are not fully convinced that they are facing an internal security threat from the Taliban, Al Qaeda, narco-criminals, warlords or other militia groups.  Many also view their own government as corrupt and incapable of providing even basic justice. To enhance diplomatic, development and military efforts, the U.S. government should support an extensive countrywide campaign that personalizes the victims and the heroes, telling the stories of those who were butchered by the Taliban and those who successfully resisted. This should be paired with extensive support for the very robust civil society organizations operating throughout the country. American South Asia policy is terminally afflicted by strategic attention deficit disorder (SADD).  In the three decades since the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the United States has trusted the Pakistanis (and allowed the ISI to run mujahedeen operations), mistrusted the Pakistanis (and sanctioned them for developing the nuclear weapons they developed five years before the sanctions), trusted the Pakistanis (and climbed into bed with Pervez Musharraf as the terror fighting hero of the post 9/11 era), dumped Musharraf, embraced Benazir Bhutto and then her  widower, and now weâre about to dump the widower. In light of the fact that successive American directors of the C.I.A. have labeled South Asia the worldâs most dangerous nuclear flashpoint, the fact that 9/11 was plotted in the mountains between Afghanistan and Pakistan, that Islamists affiliated with al Qaeda now dominate significant swaths of Pakistani territory, and that we have two nuclear armed nations eying each other warily, the administrationâs confusion is staggering. Whatâs the nightmare scenario?  This is it.  We have another president in Washington who believes that if he only finds the right president (of Pakistan, Afghanistan, whatever), the situation on the ground will improve.  Another president who believes that more troops equals better strategy.  Another president who believes that nuclear weapons and the creeping domination of territory is something that can be managed by better diplomacy.  Another president that has been persuaded, as Secretary Gates said today, that Saudi Arabia can help manage our problems. These problems arenât going to be solved by having special envoys with better titles, or subcontracting American defense to Saudi Arabia.   We need clear indications of long term American commitment to the region, training and equipping of the Pakistani military, and effectively integrated military and aid programs.  And what of the billions that have already been spent? Like soldiers, money should not be obligated without a strategy.  Neither Bush or Obama were interested in scrutinizing where U.S. aid goes and what it achieves, preferring to trumpet the mere expenditure as policy.  Absent these changes, we are inviting our enemies to believe again in American weakness.  And we know where that led the last time. What could we do if Pakistan collapsed and the security of its roughly 100 nuclear weapons could no longer be vouched for? The answer, in most scenarios, is that we could only usefully do what the Pakistanis themselves (or whatever fraction of their government and military remained intact at the time) might ask us to do.  Unilateral American action would probably be too little, too late. Some might say, aren’t Pakistani nuclear weapons in easily identified sites that we could target with air power or special forces, and destroy, if necessary? Such an option might be worth considering if the alternative were to allow nuclear weapons to fall into the hands of extremists. But the timing and the logistics would be challenging. We would not want to bomb sites that remained in government hands, even if Pakistani forces seemed to be gradually losing control of the situation.  Yet if we waited even an hour or two after the sites were seized, the weapons could already have been removed. The flight time for American bombers operating from the military base Diego Garcia might be too long, even if the aircraft had been predeployed and authorized to strike the sites.  There is also the danger that our weapons would not penetrate the hardened facilities, mostly likely underground. (In theory, U.S. special forces could in theory penetrate almost any site  if they could be deployed in adequate numbers to fend off insurgents, and fast enough to beat the insurgents to the bombs. But those assumptions might be dubious.) Moreover, there could be weapons in sites we don’t know about, since the Pakistanis don’t trust us entirely and the locations of all their weapons are unlikely to be fully known. As American officials have noted, some weapons could be in transit at a given moment, especially if the Pakistanis came to believe that the security of their nuclear bunkers was in jeopardy. On the other hand, if Pakistan and its leaders were willing to ask for help to create secure perimeters around nuclear sites, the United States could do a lot.  Such a joint mission would also be a useful deterrent against possible Indian actions against such sites.  I doubt things will get this bad, but if they do, let’s hope Islamabad has the good sense to request our collaboration on the ground. After years of the much touted cooperation on “terrorism,” it is not clear if the United States and Pakistan have a sufficient convergence of interests. In the last several weeks, confidence in Pakistan’s ability to manage its many challenges has eroded.  Violence from the western provinces intrudes into the urban centers, the civilian elected government has made some regrettable choices that have damaged consensus about democracy and the rule of law, and the true intentions of the military and its subordinate intelligence units toward the radical Islamists including the Taliban are enduring concerns. But a security breakdown at the nuclear facilities and total takeover of the state by the Taliban are exceedingly low probability scenarios, and should not be the main focus of American attention and concern.  Rather, we still need to devote time and effort to building trust in our long-term intentions, and avoid antagonizing Pakistan’s tense leadership. For example, the Obama-Biden plan to expand funding for education and basic human needs may help counter some of the acute anti-Americanism that sees Washington, even under Obama, pursuing a military strategy that has harmed Pakistani civilians.  We are a supporting cast player in Pakistan’s strategy for economic development and political reform; we should have no illusions that we will be able to determine the pace or outcomes of change.  But such engagement may be critical to putting the immediate security cooperation into a context that is more palatable for Pakistan’s people and its leaders. Gen. David Petraeus, head of the United States Central Command, has stated that the next two weeks are crucial to Pakistan’s survival, while David Kilcullen, the counterinsurgency expert, has said that the country could collapse within six months.  General Kiyani, Pakistan’s Army chief, could declare martial law imminently if his counter-offensives in the Swat region prove ineffective in stemming Taliban infiltration into the Punjab. But that action will mean little unless the Pakistani government can regain control of the restive Pashtun-dominated provinces, or risk losing its nominal authority over those areas forever. On the political level, the National Assembly must pass a constitutional amendment to integrate the Federally Administered Tribal Areas into the Northwest Frontier Province and mandate a fresh round of provincial elections. This would give the government some way to replace gradually the Frontier Crimes Regulation, the British-era laws that were imposed to control the Pashtun tribal areas and which have abetted the Taliban’s rise in those regions. President Zardari must also allow the sign the Political Parties Act to allow the formation of political groups in those areas. These steps would allow the government to assert sovereignty and justify a strengthened presence of the Frontier Corps and police to monitor elections, while forcing the Taliban to consider secular options. A smarter balance between military and police efforts is also needed. Pakistan needs to launch its own indigenous version of the NATO-led Provincial Reconstruction Teams, which have had some success in maintaining local order, building relationships with district-level authorities, and stimulating small-scale economic activity. Yet while the focus to date has been almost exclusively on military-driven counterinsurgency, this requires boosting police recruitment and training while corralling civilian forces to oversee the construction of roads, schools, hospitals, and government offices. For its part, the military must now focus on internal defense, disrupting militant networks which have gained strength even in the Punjabi heartland. If the recent protests against Talibanization rippling across continent are any indication, the secular elites are becoming quite vocal. This sliver of the population together with Pakistan’s wealthy diaspora could play an influential role in restoring unity among Pakistan’s many factions. Comments are no longer being accepted. Does the possibility of the Taliban RULING Pakistan occur to anyone here? Once they become the “legitimate” (and I use that term very, very loosely) rulers of Pakistan, by whatever means, they will certainly negotiate or demand access to WMD’s.  As is typical of US foreign policy, short-term solutions fail in the long run. There IS a solution to terrorism but using bombs and bullets doesn’t work. Maybe if you stopped electing pinheads like Bush, Reagan, et. al. you would have someone in office who could afford to institute long term solutions. Otherwise, happy nukes, guys!!! A vote for the GOP is a vote for the Taliban- extremism begets extremism. The crisis in Pakistan is a result of failed USA policies. It has been the same since ages that US always trusts Pakistan & keeps on giving billions of dollars to the corrupt officials. This money is basically used for maintaining huge army & for the luxury of corrupt politicians & army officials. It is a mockery of Democracy & its legacies. USA should have channeled their billions of dollars for education, health & creating jobs but the end result is that they have blown away billions of dollars of hard working tax payers money. With such a huge crises looming around it is surprising that there is no constructive & productive steps being taken till to date. It is easier said than done but still the steps to be taken should be 2 points programme. 1) Short Term- counter attacks in a massive way to neutralize taliban. 2) Long Term – invest time & money for education, creating new jobs, health & the most important to gain confidence of a common man who are totally alienated as of today. Democracy is the enemy of stability in the Islamic world.  Our addiction to political fairy tales will lead to disaster. To send the Sec. Defense to Saudi Arabia for assistance with Pakistan civil distrubances is serious mistake as it was Saudis who gave U.S. 9-11 because they hate U.S. for supporting the kindom with its tens of thousands of princes and princesses leading the high life while vast majority of Saudi people live in poverty.  The militants hate Saudi Arabia and its present government as much or more than they hate the U.S. for supporting them.  To call on them to help Pakistan would be like calling on Jefferson Davis to help the U.S. government! While we suffer the handwringing over the prospect of Iran obtaining nuclear capability, the prospect of one of our ostensible allies (an ally we allowed or even encouraged to have nuclear weapons) descending into the status of a failed state is far more frightening.   Short of universal nuclear disarmament enforced by the world’s governments, the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission should be given the power to at least temporarily quarantine the nuclear capability of any nation deemed a threat to its own people and the people outside of its borders.  If this smacks of world government, so be it.  Douglas MacArthur stood on thedeck of the battleship Missouri and innocently foretold and end of all war given the introduction of atomic weapons.  We are now playing with hellfire. how can there be a causal resolve without addressing the root causes? critical action is required now: to  control of all defense industry in the region consolidate the geopolitical framework Iran and isaeli accord is  vital to control defense industry. This is the biggest challenge. Sen. Gates is clearly taking the right steps America cannot do this alone ow can there be a causal resolve without addressing the root causes? critical action is required now: to control of all defense industry in the region consolidate the geopolitical framework **  Iranian and Israeli accord is vital to control defense industry. This is the biggest challenge. Sen. Gates is clearly taking the right steps America cannot do this alone I agree with a lot of the analysis I have read, as a pakistani I truly believe in one thing which is to have a broader plan of development in every sector. Dont just throw money at the government and fund a never ending thirst for corruption. Building roads, schooling and creation of jobs by creating industrial zones all over the country are some of the ideas which actually the US government should work towards since pakistani government is not willing too, As far as the nuclear arsenal going into wrong hands I dont believe in that. The solution lies in the security of the state of Pakistan. All five contributors cumulatively present a pragmatic approach to the protection of Pakistan’s nuclear assets. The people of Pakistan are sceptics by conditioning. They have lived 60 years in a society where sucessive  governments, institutions, bureacracy and the judiciary have incessantly left them out of the the loop in the very mandate they were supposed to serve. The “managed” institutions have no credibility. The cycle in each tenure has been the same promise of utopian reality followed by another round of deluded despair. The security of this State is compromised by the utter sense of dejection, apathy and “the more things change the more they remain the same. The State has been sleeping at the helm, blamed it’s woes on all but itself and left in their comfort zone will not act on symptoms but the terminal onslaught of the disease. Pakistan must integrate the tribal areas in to the Frontier province, ensure federal and provincial laws are applied, undertake a massive economic uplift program to blend the seriously under developed areas of the border regions to the main urban centers. The integration of it’s people to the Federation rather than ethnically carved out provinces must be undertaken. The ridiculous reality of a citizen of Pakistan requiring permission of warlords and feudals to vist their geographical areas of influence is absurd. Unless Pakistanis look at themselves as Pakistani first versus Pathans, Punjabis, sindhis,balochis and mohajir this country’s security will always be fragmented at best and an easy prey to manipulation. The social fabric of Pakistan must change for the entire country to present itself as a truly independant sovereign nation. It’s path progressively is one of Balkanization and it’s end has a precedence in the former Yugoslavia. The social and intellectual elite can initiate change only with the full backing of the State and it’s institutions if they are sincere. But as most major State players are themselves part of the problem , a  sincere effort cannot be taken for granted. The outside world must be careful. Any dictation or an overt interference will make Pakistanis view all gestures with suspicion no matter how pure they may be. If Pakistan is to be helped it must be helped unconditionally, not with regard to monetary accountability but with the same purity that Germany and Japan were reconstructed and won over to the other side. One could argue that the United States has found itself struggling to define a robust Pakistan policy because its leaders couldn’t rely on able experts who understand what’s going on. This sad reality appears to be true today as it was yesterday. As the saying goes: you reap as you sow.  For decades, successive US administration turned the eyes other way and let Pakistani governments of the day (mostly military dictatorships) build nukes with covert funds from CIA, supposedly to counter/punish India from walking in hands with USSR.  Contrary to US policy of supporting democracy, it screwed the largest democracy in the world and slept with military dictatorship.  Why cry now? Just be prepared for the eventuality of Talibans destroying much of democracy. Only problem is that as the stated policy of Talibans for years, they will take India/Pakistan first down before destroying US allies elsewhere but will never possibly reach US shores.  It is time, US forces simply overtake Pak nukes as it is a failed state anyway, despite the comments on the contrary from the military and political top brasses today.  Dithering on that will cost the democratic world big time.  This is a fight of fundamentalist, power hungry mullahs against civilzation and has nothing to do with any religion. No God of any demonination, if it exists, ever sanctions mass scale dehumanization and killing. Some of these “insightful” commentators have obviously never been to Pakistan. I could pick gaping holes in all their “expert” opinions but can’t be bothered. What worries me is the fact that these sort of people help formulate policy in the  USA. That is quite a scary thought. Anyway, in my opinion, these people should perhaps look at the influence of Saudia Arabia in Pakistan. Before the Saudis â whose citizens represented 15 out of the 19 9/11 hijackers bye the way â started pumping cash into religious schools in Pakistan most Muslims in the country could affiliate themselves with Sufism. This is the most moderate form of Islam. But thanks to the USA’s favourite Arab ally, Saudi Arabia, poor people in Pakistan now get free education that indoctrinates them into Wahibism â the most extreme form of Islam. So despite the fact Saudi Arabians planned and executed 9/11 and despite the fact they now use their oil cash to spread their retrogressive brand of Islam, Pakistan is the problem! Sorry guys, Saudia Arabian cash is the problem. But the USA won’t deal with it because the Royal family in Saudi are an ally and buy American arms. But other rich Saudis are allowed to spread their evil version of Islam and corrupt the world with it. Why do I think we will still be discussing these issues twenty, thirty, forty and even fifty years into the future? I think we talk about Pakistan in the U.S. as objects upon which to represent our fears than as a country moreso than we do with most other parts of the world.  Pakistan’s government structure, at least, are sometimes subjects as well as objects for inquiry or debate.  We interpose distinctions–tropes–like “failed state” onto that country without really knowing what it means, then we pay many columnists to write about the trope, instead of the reality, which isn’t really apparent to non-stakeholders in the Pakistani skirmishes, no matter how educated. Surely, we’ve (the U.S. here; I acknowledge that the Times is in some way an international paper of record) made mistakes, but a lot of our mistakes are because we think that if we do X (give Pakistan aid, drop bombs on their “tribal areas”), they will definitely do Y–capitulate in some way–like machines or something.  And we wonder why Zardari or Musharraf or Sharif do not do exactly what we want.  They’re neither stupid nor automatic, because they are or were leaders of a very large country, hardly born yesterday. I liked Mowatt-Larssen’s reminder that the Pakistani military is by far the most stable institution in Pakistan.  Pakistan’s statehood is in some ways problematic, but it’s not exactly Somalia, in that anti-nationalists are unlikely to win the day, whatever concessions have to be made to religious groups in provinces.  While I think that America needs to be insistent that our concerns are quartered–that we have some mechanism to stabilize Afghanistan, which means border security for Pakistan, and that the country conform to minimum international anti-proliferation efforts–we have some stable structure to interact with in Pakistan.  I would even be comfortable with an even rosier stance with India from the U.S. (not exactly germane to Pakistan, directly, but going too far in that direction would likely make U.S.-Pakistani relations more tense), but not at the expense of dealing with Pakistan plainly and fairly. Yes, most Pakistanis do not see our “war on terror” as theirs. Is that really a surprise when they watch the invasion of Gaza with nary a word from us?  To them we appear hypocritical as they see fellow Muslims in Palestine suffer under decades of occupation while we stand on the sidelines at best. None of the above learned commentators seem to understand or address this central disconnect. You see the problem is that President Zardari and his lackey Prime-Minister have virtually no legitimacy in Pakistan. Its all good when western nations pledge billions in (non-military) aid, but think about who you’re giving this money to! You’re living in a fantasy world if you think that such aid is going to trickle down to the masses in shape of socio-economic programs. Basically, the top political and military brass would exchange their Range Rovers for BMWs and would be able to afford Princeton instead of Berkeley for their kids! Here’s a recommendation: Initiate a “Pakistan Assistance Fund” and put guys like Greg Mortensen (author Three Cups of Tea) and Imran Khan (the only Pakistani politician who has actually done some philanthropic work) in charge. Financial aspect should be overseen by Mr. Shahid Javed Burki (former VP of the World Bank). If we’re honest about the integrity of this “aid” then this is perhaps the only way I see it work. Mark my words, this particular government, nor the Army, not even the ostensibly popular Nawaz Sharif would do any justice to all this monetary assistance.  For once, the U.S. should try to negotiate with the idea of helping Pakistanis and not their stooge (remember Musharraff, Zia, Ayub) Policy-makers in Washington would do well to read Misagh Parsa’s social autopsies exploring the Islamist revolution in Iran to understand the enormity of the terror that the people of Pakistan face from the Taliban.  The danger that the government of Pakistan faces is identical to what the Pahlavi monarchy faced in Iran, its military and police forces are as overwhelmingly powerful as those that the Shah had at his command. And yet, if the Khomeinists could take Iran, the fearsome possibility is that the Taliban could, if the same mistakes are made in Pakistan as were in Iran in 1979. Pakistan is a country where the vast majority of people have never voted for the ISlamist parties. If the Taliban were to succeed, the vast majority of Pakistanis would be in danger of coming under their control, not to forget the dangers that this would cause to the rest of the world. Giving aid to pakistan is to pour money into a sewer.the weapons and money provided to pak will end up being used against india.The only solution to this problem is to defang the snake and take over pak’s nuclear weapons which are a threat to the entire world.i fail to understand how the words of any Pakistani government are ever to be trusted as majority of the population is steeped in fundamentalism including the military and specially the ISI. Musharraf had gone blue in the face denying nuclear proliferation though it was clearly shown to be to the contrary. Believing empty promises is going to lead the US to a situation which will be too late to salvage.The question is not if Pakistan is to be forcibly relieved of its nuclear weapons but when,and the answer is now.Pakistan can be pressurised to give up its nuclear weapons if it is to receive aid.If that fails then a combined military action between NATO ,India and Israel will be the best way to get rid of this ever present threat. The above scenarios are all interesting and do not want to sound like the last administration but the possibility of nuclear power being transferred to the Taliban or any other terrorist group is quite possible given the present circumstances . I realize that we do not know where all the sites are but every  effort should be made to discover their whereabouts and immediately   secure the sites with our own forces if necessary. Any lessor line of attack that could result in a situation so much more dangerous than what exists now. If one looks at history and takes a pragmatic view, the answer is simple. We need to find a military strong man who shares our priorities and help him to stage a coup amd take over the government. Too much of Pakistan is still uncivilized and stuck in the dark ages. The country is not ready for a true democracy. We should have strenthened Musharraf’s position rather than undermining him. We made the same mistake when we undermined the Shah of Iran and have been paying for that mistake for 30 years. All your experts are living in a fantasy world. Why do they think that the Army is somehow ideologically separate from Talibanism? The father of Talibanism in Pakistan was its most powerful military dictator– the late General Zia ul-Haq. He sponsored a book called THE QURANIC CONCEPT OF WAR authored by his protege one Brigadier S.K. Malik. I am amazed that none of your experts seems to know of the existence of this seminal book. The Taliban doctrine is spelled out in this book by a military author. It is required reading for all Pakistani officers. Indian forces have recovered copies of the Urdu translation of this book from slain Pakistani militants. Please ask your experts to read this book, originally in English. I have reviewed it for the U.S. web publication The American Thinker and elsewhere. (A Google search should locate it.) Ask them at least to read the review before spewing out pointless opinions that bear no relationship to reality. Also, the U.S. ‘experts’ should be talking to Indians who have the most experience fighting Islamic militancy and not just self-serving Pakistani generals and venal politicians like Zardari. Assume that Taliban and the Army are one and also that the extremist are in control of the Pakistani nuclear arsenal with the Army acting as their proxy. Start your planning with that eventuality in mind. It is now a fait accompli N.S. Rajaram “FOLLOW THE MONEY”! THE U. S.  must help Pakistan build, not rebuild because they never had one, the infrastructure but hold the purse strings all the way down to placing the paycheck in the hand of the laborer. We should position our people,peace corps types with MBA’s, next to the Pakistani managers in the way the Soviet Political Agents were counterparts to the military and industrial managers. Trust-Forget It! While the think tanks are going into overdrive trying to come up with a plausible solution, ultimately some very hard and inevitable decisions will have to be made. I know nobody is willing to look at 800- pound  gorilla in the room eyeball to eyeball. This has tragedy written all over it. A lucky raid by the extremists with the help of sympathisers in the military and the ISI , The jihadis hit could hit the jackpot they’ve been looking for over two decades.Ignoring the problem doesn’t make it go away. The U.S, , having encouraged  or deliberatey turned a blind eye towards Pakistani nuclear programme, is going to find that radioactive chickens have come home to roost. Take action now, by hook or crook, get the nukes away from the people who think that their real life starts after death, Transfering Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal to Saudi’s for safekeeping may not be the right answer to decades of stupid planning by sucessive American and Pakistani givernments. The rushed visit to Saudia by Gates to seek assurances in case the tide turns in Pakistan was at best misplaced trust and creatinga very unstable ME with a Sunni Atom Bomb vs a Shia atom bomb in Iran. This has even surpassed Dr AQ Khan who went around the world with a shopping bag, part buying and part shoplifting. The Saudis without any effort will now be the recipients of this most coveted nuclear trophy courtesy of Americans and of course Pakistanis. It seems like that the great super power is no different when it comes to identifying issues and managing situations – it ends up creating new issues and in fact worsening the situation. The sudden local rise of Barelvi Islam to counter deobandi influence and the loud sounds being generated by the oeace loving barelvis may prove counter productive in long run as this is not a natural evolution of Sunni Barelvi Islam and by giving them recognition, resources, state patronage and arms wont solve the mess. Both US & Pakistan are playing with incendiary devices and are creating new mosnters that will show their ugly face and strength in near future. Idiots do galore S.

"Washington Post's Tehran reporter and three other journalists arrested in Iran","Fri 25 Jul 2014 11.23 BST   First published on Fri 25 Jul 2014 11.23 BST   The Washington Post's correspondent in Tehran has been arrested along with his Iranian wife and two US photojournalists. Iranian judicial offficials confirmed on Friday that Jason Rezaian , who holds dual US and Iranian citizenship, had been detained and is under investigation. Gholamhossein Esmaili, the head of Tehran's provincial judicial office, confirmed the Post's report of the arrest, according to the state news agency Irna. The US reporter and his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, who is also a journalist, are believed to have been arrested on Tuesday evening, but it was not clear if the authorities had a warrant or where they had been taken to. Iran has detained dozens of local journalists and is branded by the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) as one of the world's worst enemies of the press because of the number of its imprisoned media representatives, but it has generally been more cautious in arresting those working for foreign media. "We are deeply troubled by this news and are concerned for the welfare of Jason, Yeganeh and two others said to have been detained with them," said the Post's foreign editor, Douglas Jehl. "[Rezaian] is an experienced, knowledgeable reporter who deserves protection and whose work merits respect." Salehi works in Tehran for the UAE-based newspaper the National. The two photojournalists detained along with them, who are US citizens, have not been named and it was not clear who they were working for. The CPJ's Middle East and North Africa programme coordinator, Sherif Mansour, called on Iran to release the four immediately. "We call on Iranian authorities to immediately explain why Jason Rezaian, Yeganeh Salehi, and two other journalists have been detained, and we call for their immediate release," said Mansour. "Iran has a dismal record with regard to its treatment of imprisoned journalists. We hold the Iranian government responsible for the safety of these four." Rezaian is among the few reporters who have been able to obtain official permission to work for foreign media in Iran. The New York Times's bureau chief in Tehran, Thomas Erdbrink, also reacted to Rezaian's arrest. "I strongly condemn the arrest of my friend and colleague @jrezaian and his wife @YeganehSalehi, and two photographers, also friends," he tweeted on Thursday. In one of his recent dispatches from Tehran, Rezaian reported about a new wave of interest among Iranian youth in baseball. The Iranian-American has also been active on Twitter, and in June posted a picture of himself along with Salehi and the US celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain, who had visited Tehran for the first time. Iran's president, Hassan Rouhani, is revamping Tehran's relations with the west, especially the US, but the country's judiciary, which is independent of his government, and the security apparatus have intensified their crackdown on journalists. Earlier this month, a prominent female Iranian journalist, Marzieh Rasouli, became the latest to be arrested under Rouhani . Her detention drew a great deal of condemnation, including by the US philosopher Noam Chomsky, who told the Guardian her detention was entirely unacceptable."
"Report Sheds Light on Transgender Sex Workers in China","When Piao Piao, 26, who was born a boy in Shandong Province, arrived in Beijing in 2008 to live a life as the woman she felt she truly was, she faced innumerable problems. After she began dressing as a woman, while still using official documents that identified her as male, it was difficult for her to find a mainstream job. So she became an entertainer in bars, and supplemented her income as a sex worker. She earns about 200 renminbi, or $33, a night for her shows, which on good nights end with dates with heterosexual men, whom she brings back to her shoebox-size studio apartment in southeast Beijing. “I face a lot of discrimination here,” Piao Piao (her stage name) said one recent afternoon at her apartment, where the curtains were drawn. “I’d like to find a real job, but it’s not easy here in the city. So I’ve relied on performing and dancing, and other various means.”  “You can’t live too ostentatiously here,” she continued. “You have to adjust your expectations.” Piao Piao’s experiences are typical of those of the transgender sex workers in Beijing and Shanghai surveyed by Asia Catalyst , a New York-based nongovernmental organization that focuses on health issues in China and Southeast Asia, in conjunction with two Chinese organizations. Their recent report , titled “My Life Is Too Dark to See the Light,” draws on interviews with 70 people, most of whom left their rural hometowns to live in more liberal-minded cities, where they make a living from sex work. The report calls for greater government recognition of the problems of those who have a mismatch between their birth sex and their internal sense of gender. It also calls for actions including antidiscrimination laws, streamlined procedures for changing one’s gender on official documents, and greater access to medical care. “Transgender female sex workers are among the most marginalized and vulnerable populations in China today,” the report said. They “face a broad array of discrimination in social and policy frameworks, preventing this highly marginalized group access to a wide spectrum of services and legal protections.” Cross-dressing and sex-change procedures are not illegal in China, but the Chinese Society of Psychiatry classifies individuals seeking to change their gender as suffering from a mental illness â a judgment many rights advocates seek to change. The report recommends more efficient ways to change gender markers on documents like household registration and personal identity cards â documents that are essential for living in Chinese cities and for finding employment. Several people interviewed for the report described the obstacles they face in everyday life, like going to one of the public bathhouses that are common in northern China, receiving medical care or even walking on the street dressed as a woman. Some recounted being reported by neighbors to the local authorities, and being evicted from their apartments. Those employed in sex work, which is illegal in China, reported abuse and extortion by the police. In Shanghai and Beijing, police officers have often relied on entrapment tactics in hotels, posing as clients to solicit transgender individuals. Several said they believed they had been arrested to help the police meet arrest quotas. Xiao Tong, a sex worker quoted in the report, described the way she was treated at a police station: “Once I went in, they pulled on my wig, really hard, and hit me,” she said. “They asked me if I was a man, and I said I wasn’t. Then they carried out a body search and flipped my bra up and groped around. They asked really perverted questions, like, ‘How do you have sex?’ I turned around and asked, ‘Do you want to try?’ Then he kicked me, really, he really kicked me.” Rights advocates acknowledge that China has made progress in its treatment of transgender individuals. In 2009, the Health Ministry issued clinical standards for gender reassignment surgery, and several hospitals now offer hormone treatment. But much more needs to be done, they argue. “In recent years, we have seen a stronger and more visible rights movement for homosexuals, but we’ve seen few transgender-rights activists,” said Tingting Shen, one of the authors of the report and the director of advocacy, research and policy at Asia Catalyst. “When I talk to transgender activists, they think that right now the government is not fully aware of their situation, or aware that it needs to do something.” One recommendation is that the government should incorporate the needs of transgender individuals in the H.I.V./AIDS plan for 2016 to 2020 that it is expected to be released in April. Asia Catalyst hopes the plan will expand the existing H.I.V. surveillance system to study the health of people with gender dysphoria and to provide more medical services for sex workers. “I think the research we’ve done is just a start,” Ms. Shen said. “We would like to see the health department carefully assess the needs of the population because this is a really diverse group, with very diverse sexual activities. They might play different roles with different partners, so this is an urgent issue that we should have a strategy for now.” Sinosphere, the China blog of The New York Times, delivers intimate, authoritative coverage of the planet's most populous nation and its relationship with the rest of the world.

"In Shift, Iran’s President Calls for End to Syrian Crackdown","Advertisement By NEIL MacFARQUHAR SEPT. 8, 2011  For years, posters celebrating the decades-old alliance joining Syria and Iran festooned the streets and automobiles of the Syrian capital — the images of Presidents Bashar al-Assad and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad embroidered with roses and daffodils. But that alliance is now strained, and on Thursday, President Ahmadinejad of Iran became the most recent, and perhaps the most unexpected, world leader to call for President Assad to end his violent crackdown of an uprising challenging his authoritarian rule in Syria. When the Arab Spring broke out, upending the regional order, Iran seemed to emerge a winner: its regional adversary, Hosni Mubarak of Egypt , was ousted from power and its most important ally, Syria, was emboldened. But the popular demands for change swept into Syria, and now, as Mr. Assad’s forces continue to shoot unarmed demonstrators, Iran sees its fortunes fading on two fronts: its image as a guardian of Arab resistance has been battered, and its most important regional strategic ally is in danger of being ousted. Advertisement Even while it has been accused of providing financial and material support for Mr. Assad’s crackdown, Iran has increased calls for Syria to end the violence and reform its political process, a formula Tehran apparently hopes will repair its image and, if heeded, possibly bolster Mr. Assad’s standing. Advertisement “Regional nations can assist the Syrian people and government in the implementation of essential reforms and the resolution of their problems,” Mr. Ahmadinejad said in an interview in Tehran, according to his official Web site. Other press accounts of the interview with a Portuguese television station quoted him as also saying, “A military solution is never the right solution,” an ironic assessment from a man whose own questionable re-election in 2009 prompted huge street demonstrations that were put down with decisive force. The collapse of the Assad government would be a strategic blow to Shiite-majority Iran, cutting off its most important bridge to the Arab world while empowering its main regional rivals, Saudi Arabia and its increasingly influential competitor, Turkey , both Sunni-majority nations. Iran would also lose its main arms pipeline to Hezbollah in Lebanon , further undermining its ambition to be the primary regional power from the Levant to Pakistan . Not long ago, Iran and its Arab allies like Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah , were seen as folk heroes to many Arabs for their confrontational stance toward the United States and Israel . But Iran has suddenly found itself on the wrong side of the barricades. “Assad’s heroic image of resistance is being watered down,” said Vali Nasr, a professor at Tufts University and the author of “The Shia Revival: How Conflicts Within Islam Will Shape the Future.” “That’s the problem for Iran and for Hezbollah. They are trying to find out how to have their cake and eat it, too.” Demonstrators clogging the streets from Tunisia to Egypt to Syria are demanding freedom and democracy, forcing Iran to openly struggle with the problem of how to endorse the revolutionary spirit while simultaneously buttressing its crucial strategic Arab ally. “They don’t fit into the framework of toppling dictators and democracy and all that,” said Paul Salem, director of the Carnegie Middle East Center in Lebanon. Yet many analysts say that the Iranians have tried to play both sides of the barricades, supporting their allies in Syria with all manner of aid while simultaneously voicing support for the revolutions elsewhere, initially calling them the offspring of their own 1979 revolution. Advertisement “It is mostly for the Arab gallery, rather than a tangible policy shift,” said Cengiz Candar, a prominent Turkish columnist. “In terms of the Syrian opposition, there is nobody Iran can stand on in case the regime is replaced.” Iran has been helping Syria with everything from money to advice on controlling the Internet, analysts say, offering its expertise to help stave off the catastrophe that Mr. Assad’s collapse would be for Tehran’s regional ambitions. Aside from propping up Syria with billions of dollars, it has pressed others, including Iraq , to support Mr. Assad. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

Syrian protesters take it as a matter of faith that security forces from both Iran and Hezbollah have been drawn into the fray, trading cellphone videos that are said to show Hezbollah fighters streaming across the border in black S.U.V.’s. Given that the Assad government has had about 40 years to perfect the instruments of repression, most analysts believe that it does not really need men or much advice from the outside. But in its ever more stringent sanctions against Syria, the European Union included the Quds force of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards , accusing it of providing “technical assistance, equipment and support to the Syrian security services to repress civilian protest movements.” Analysts are convinced that behind the scenes the Iranians are pushing for a tough line, suggesting that their repression of the 2009 democracy protests in Iran is the model to follow. “Iran calling for Syria to dialogue rather than use force against its population is akin to Silvio Berlusconi telling Charlie Sheen not to womanize,” said Karim Sadjadpour of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, who is a sharp critic of the Iranian leadership. Analysts say the scale and the duration of the protests in Syria just became too great for the Iranians to ignore, and yet they still try. “Muslim people in Egypt, Libya , Tunisia, Yemen and other countries are in need of this vigilance today,” the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , said in a recent sermon marking the end of the holy month of Ramadan. “They must not let the enemies hijack the victories they have gained.” Advertisement Then he talked about the oppression of people in Bahrain — which is mainly Shiite — before moving on to the famine in Somalia . On the other hand, the constant focus on the potential repercussions of the uprisings clearly shows that Iran’s leaders are worried. Not least among their worries is that the protests could set off renewed demonstrations at home, although aside from some environmental protests in the northwest, nothing significant has been reported. There is also an increasingly vocal school of thought in Iran that says it has too much vested in the Assad government. Among other things, it has allowed regional competitors like Turkey, a largely Sunni country, to advance at the expense of Shiite Iran. The Iranians’ minority status across much of the Arab world can make their religious credentials suspect to the majority — who might accuse them of being a force for sectarianism. “The reality of the matter is that our absolute support for Syria was a wrong policy,” Ahmad Avaei, a member of Parliament , told the Web site Khabar Online. “The people protesting against the government in that country are religious people, and the protest movement there is a grass-roots movement.” At stake is Iran’s image in the wider region, and its ability to add teeth to its claim to be upholding Arab and Muslim interests in confronting Israel. “Iran wants to be perceived as the voice of the downtrodden in the Middle East, the one country that speaks truth to power,” Mr. Sadjadpour said. “Their close rapport with the Assad regime undermines that image.” Anne Barnard contributed reporting from Beirut, Lebanon; Heba Afify from Cairo; and Artin Afkhami from Boston.

"","Advertisement  By  The New York Times  How the election and Donald Trump’s victory looks to Opinion writers.  By  Michael Lerner  It turns out that shaming the supporters of Donald J. Trump is not a good political strategy. Though job loss and economic stagnation played a role in his victory, so did shame. As the principal investigator on a study of the middle class for the National Institute of Mental Health, I found that working people’s stress is often intensified by shame at their failure to “make it” in what they are taught is a meritocratic American economy. The right has been very successful at persuading working people that they are vulnerable not because they themselves have failed, but because of the selfishness of some other villain (African-Americans, feminists, immigrants, Muslims, Jews, liberals, progressives; the list keeps growing). Instead of challenging this ideology of shame, the left has buttressed it by blaming white people as a whole for slavery, genocide of the Native Americans and a host of other sins, as though whiteness itself was something about which people ought to be ashamed. The rage many white working-class people feel in response is rooted in the sense that once again, as has happened to them throughout their lives, they are being misunderstood. So please understand what is happening here. Many Trump supporters very legitimately feel that it is they who have been facing an unfair reality. The upper 20 percent of income earners, many of them quite liberal and rightly committed to the defense of minorities and immigrants, also believe in the economic meritocracy and their own right to have so much more than those who are less fortunate. So while they may be progressive on issues of discrimination against the obvious victims of racism and sexism, they are blind to their own class privilege and to the hidden injuries of class that are internalized by much of the country as self-blame. The right’s ability to portray liberals as elitists is further strengthened by the phobia toward religion that prevails in the left. Many religious people are drawn by the teachings of their tradition to humane values and caring about the oppressed. Yet they often find that liberal culture is hostile to religion of any sort, believing it is irrational and filled with hate. People on the left rarely open themselves to the possibility that there could be a spiritual crisis in society that plays a role in the lives of many who feel misunderstood and denigrated by the fancy intellectuals and radical activists. The left needs to stop ignoring people’s inner pain and fear. The racism, sexism and xenophobia used by Mr. Trump to advance his candidacy does not reveal an inherent malice in the majority of Americans. If the left could abandon all this shaming, it could rebuild its political base by helping Americans see that much of people’s suffering is rooted in the hidden injuries of class and in the spiritual crisis that the global competitive marketplace generates. Democrats need to become as conscious and articulate about the suffering caused by classism as we are about other forms of suffering. We need to reach out to Trump voters in a spirit of empathy and contrition. Only then can we help working people understand that they do not live in a meritocracy, that their intuition that the system is rigged is correct (but it is not by those whom they had been taught to blame) and that their pain and rage is legitimate.  By  Daniel K. Williams  Donald J. Trump was elected with a higher percentage of the white evangelical vote than any other Republican presidential candidate has ever received, and he has received strong support from prominent Christian Right leaders. Yet if Mr. Trump delivers on his promises, he will not give the religious right what its leaders have traditionally demanded or what the Republican Party platform calls for. Indeed, he will give them very little national legislation at all, but will instead offer them maximum latitude to pursue their agenda at the state level — a shift that may portend a potential breakthrough in the nation’s polarizing culture wars. National legislation has long been the goal of the religious right. When the movement emerged in the late 1970s, evangelical leaders such as Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson sought federal constitutional amendments to ban abortion and restore school prayer, because they wanted to reverse what liberal rights activists had done at the national level through the Supreme Court. In the early 21st century, leaders such as James Dobson continued this trend by persuading   President George W. Bush to endorse a constitutional amendment proposal to define marriage as exclusively heterosexual. In recent years, evangelicals have become so concerned about protecting their own religious liberty against federal mandates or court decisions that they have given less attention to imposing a moral agenda on the rest of the nation. Although the Republican Party platform continues to promise a constitutional amendment protecting human life from the moment of conception, the pro-life movement has not made any serious attempts to pass that amendment since the 1980s. Nor has there been much talk in the last decade of a national ban on same-sex marriage. Mr. Trump is well positioned to promote a further shift away from national moral regulation. For much of his adult life, he held culturally libertarian views on abortion and gay rights, and he evinced little interest in the religious right’s agenda. Early in his campaign, he expressed discomfort with conservative evangelicals’ opposition to the rights of transgender people to use the public restroom of their choice. But he quickly came to embrace a “states’ rights” position on same-sex marriage and transgender rights, a position that would allow culturally liberal New Yorkers the right to pursue different policies than cultural conservatives in Mississippi or North Dakota. And while Mr. Trump stumbled over abortion during his campaign, the policy that he ultimately reverted to was to leave abortion legalization up to the states — an outcome that he would try to ensure by nominating conservative Supreme Court justices who might overturn Roe v. Wade. Mr. Trump has gone further than any previous Republican presidential nominee in a generation in insisting that the religious right should enact its agenda at the state, rather than federal, level.  Although this was the policy position of many Republicans during the 1970s (including President Gerald Ford), religious right activists persuaded the G.O.P. in the early 1980s to abandon its states-rights approach to abortion and other social issues, and promise national legislation to implement the religious right’s agenda. Mr. Trump is leading the party back to its more traditional stance. While many liberals will find this outcome unsatisfactory — since it offers them no opportunity to secure national protection for individual rights that they consider inalienable — it may be the only compromise solution that can give both conservatives and liberals the freedom to pursue their own agenda at the local level without fear of a national backlash. If a socially libertarian New Yorker can deliver this compromise to the conservative white rural evangelical voters who put him in office, both conservatives and liberals should see that for what it is: a landmark opportunity to move beyond the culture wars.  By  Marwan Bishara  Just when the people of the Middle East thought things couldn’t get any worse, Donald J. Trump is elected president of the United States. Now, their apprehension about the president-elect dwarfs their disappointment with President Obama. It could be a blessing in disguise. America, in one magic moment, you’ve revealed how you’ve changed. For the worse. Poor you, you feel so insecure, vulnerable and fragile. Like the rest of us. So, instead of reaching for your famed “can-do” spirit, lifting yourselves up by the bootstraps, you turned to a strident, bellicose type of nationalism. The kind usually associated with strutting generalissimos of Third World nations with their chests covered with made-up, self-awarded medals. Maybe the people of the Middle East will look and realize that you are no longer the Great Democracy to emulate. That your modern style of empire and your role as keeper of the world order for the world’s own good are stumbling and failing, even in your own eyes; and that we in the Middle East should not be turning to you for rescue. For as long as I can remember, you’ve been on a self-assigned mission to change the Middle East. Indeed, the world. Now, it seems as if the change has flowed the other way. You’ve voted to reduce your liberties. To narrow the range of people entitled to justice and equality before the law. To live in a place where the police should not be criticized; where fighting political correctness is more important than fighting racism; where Muslims are suspected and people who appear Hispanic can be rounded up if they’re not carrying their papers. In this election you’ve revealed that your people — like Russians, Hungarians, Iraqis, Iranians and others whose politics you normally look down on — will choose a narrow, nonsensical nationalist ethos when they feel threatened by uncertainty. Your imperial outreach allowed you to experience other cultures, but now you’ve chosen to shrink your outlook, with the expectation that the world will continue to revolve around you. It won’t. Like the rest of us, you’re now divided between those who want to make their nation great again alone and those who want to make it great together. O.K., enough about you; let’s talk about us. We in the Middle East can’t decipher what exactly your incoming president wants from us. I don’t think he knows, either. Mr. Trump said he would bring back torture and ban Muslims from entering America, and he compared the threat of “radical Islam” to Soviet Communism. He wants less engagement in the region, and fewer “free riders” like the Saudis who don’t pay enough for American protection. And he wants the United States to abandon the costly nation-building in the Middle East. What nation-building? In Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Yemen, Libya and Somalia, civil wars continue unabated. The Arab and Muslim worlds only hope the United States stops contributing to the destruction.
Mr. Trump does not exactly seem concerned for the wishes of Middle Easterners and their right to live in peace. It sounds more like what he really wants to do is pal around with other strutting, authoritarian types. Expect him to cozy up to Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, and join him in supporting Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad. Expect America’s new president to work closely with Egypt’s president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, and Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. Mr. Trump has embraced Mr. Netanyahu’s positions on Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and on abandoning the two-state solution. Instead of Americanizing the Middle East, Mr. Trump seems set on “Israelizing” America, stirring fear of Muslims and trying to wall out “the other.” Arabs, and Middle Easterners in general, should take one quick look and figure out how to be less dependent on the United States, and how to resolve their conflicts within their own, regional frameworks.
Finally, some good news. President Obama has assured us that the sun will rise tomorrow, regardless. And if the Trump presidency is as bad as I expect it to be — though not so bad that it demolishes democracy entirely — he can be voted out in four years. Meanwhile, fasten your seatbelts. It’s going to be a hell of a ride.  By  Carol Giacomo  A commitment to human rights has been a fundamental precept of NATO since the alliance was created a half century ago. You would not expect that a founding member would have to be reminded of that fact. Certainly not the United States, for all those years the leader of NATO and an inspirational embodiment of its core values. Yet this is where we find ourselves now, the day after Donald Trump won the presidency: In congratulating him on his victory, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany felt compelled to set conditions for cooperation. “Germany and America are connected by values of democracy, freedom and respect for the law and the dignity of man, independent of origin, skin color, religion, gender, sexual orientation or political views,” she said in a statement, adding: “I offer the next President of the United States close cooperation on the basis of these values.” Mr. Trump’s behavior during his campaign was antithetical to those values. He has threatened to ban Muslims from the United States, refuse refugees, deport 11 million undocumented workers and build a wall on the border with Mexico. He has disparaged African Americans, Mexican Americans, women and people with disabilities. Moreover, Mr. Trump has called into question America’s commitment to NATO and displayed a befuddling penchant for defending Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, who is waging war in eastern Ukraine and destabilizing other parts of Europe by supporting far-right groups. He received no pushback on Wednesday from Theresa May, the British prime minister, who simply congratulated Mr. Trump on his win. The two leaders’ reactions were further proof that, after Britain’s decision to leave the European Union, we will have to look to Mrs. Merkel not just to lead Europe but to replace America in leading NATO as well.  By  Gil Troy  “I am scared that if Ronald Reagan gets into office, we are going to see more of the Ku Klux Klan and a resurgence of the Nazi Party,” Coretta Scott King said in November, 1980. “I’m afraid things are going to blow sky high during this next term,” a nursing student said. He’s a “nitwit,” added a Democrat. “He’s shallow, superficial and frightening,” one of that year’s historic numbers of “undecideds” insisted. Ronald Reagan “seems not to relish complexity and subtlety,” the New York Times editorial endorsing President Jimmy Carter’s re-election proclaimed. “The problem is not a loose lip but the simple answer.”  While fearing what Reagan’s own running mate, George H.W. Bush, had dismissed as Reagan’s “voodoo economics” during their primary fight, the editorial board feared “voodoo diplomacy,” too. From coast to coast, half of a divided nation abhorred —  and underestimated — the president-elect. “The American people,“ Hamilton Jordan, a key Carter aide, said, "are not going to elect a 70-year-old, right-wing, ex-movie actor to be president.” Pollsters reported in 1980 that “More voters held negative attitudes toward each presidential candidate than in any campaign since polling began” — a record we just broke in 2016. The economic dislocation of galloping inflation and the energy crisis produced a nasty campaign. Feeling neglected by Washington, millions embraced Ronald Reagan’s populism. Despite the Democratic panic, Ronald Reagan left America richer and safer after two terms as president. Reagan defied expectations by turning toward the center. He acted as president of the United States, not president of the Republican Party. Reagan used the transition period to heal wounds while claiming a broad policy mandate, despite winning only 50.7 percent of the popular vote. He vowed to “rebuild a bipartisan base for American foreign policy.” His cabinet choices were so moderate that Pat Buchanan, the conservative flamethrower whose rhetorical bluster anticipated the advent of Donald Trump, lamented: “Where is the dash, color, and controversy — the customary concomitants of a Reagan campaign?” Just weeks into Reagan’s first term, conservatives were demanding that his aides had to “Let Reagan be Reagan,” meaning: stop being so reasonable. But in adjusting, in tempering, Reagan was being Reagan. He knew the Constitution limited presidential powers — and he faced a Democratic Congress led by the formidable speaker of the House Tip O’Neill to remind him further. Illustrating Richard Neustadt’s lesson that the power of the president is mostly “the power to persuade,” many of Reagan’s achievements were symbolic. Rather than shrinking government as he promised, for example, he only lowered the federal government’s growth rate. History is not destiny. And Reagan had both a lighter touch than Mr. Trump, and eight years’ experience as  governor of California. Still, history is full of shifts and surprises. Mr. Trump must be a healer and unite America, as he tried doing in his victory speech. If he fails, the checks and balances that sometimes help crusading ideologues become effective leaders can ultimately impose a necessary gridlock. When asked about conservatives’ frustration with him, Reagan kindly insisted it was only a “very few” critics. He said: “There are some people who think that you should, on principle, jump off the cliff with the flag flying if you can’t get everything you want.” Reagan recalled that “If I found when I was governor that I could not get 100 percent of what I asked for, I took 80 percent.” So far, Mr. Trump, the political amateur and sputtering demagogue, has lacked Reagan’s magnanimity or his flexibility. Can the reality-show star turned president-elect mimic the actor turned president?  By  James R. Jones  In 1968, there was a demand among voters for change, especially regarding Vietnam and foreign policy, and there was a backlash against some of the Great Society programs. Then, as now, the Democratic candidate was tied to the departing administration and hamstrung to differentiate a new set of policies. As a result, the Democratic presidential nominee, Hubert H. Humphrey, narrowly lost to the Republican, Richard M. Nixon, a candidate who was despised by a large percentage of the electorate. One positive outcome of that election was the first organized transition from the departing to incoming governments. President Lyndon B. Johnson always believed that, after an election, Democrats and Republicans should come together to do what’s right for the country. At the time, I was President Johnson’s appointments secretary, the position that has since evolved into the White House chief of staff. Right after the 1968 results came in, the president put me in charge of organizing a transition process, something that had never been done. “Nixon is an S.O.B., but he’s the only president we’ll have,” Johnson told me. “I want him and all of his team to be fully prepared to govern after the Inauguration at 12 noon on January 20.” A few days later, Johnson and Nixon met at the White House along with Nixon’s top advisers, including H. R. Haldeman and John Mitchell. There we mapped out a program in which all of the Johnson cabinet and major White House staff members would brief their incoming counterparts as often as was desired by the new administration. My charge was to work with Haldeman, who became my successor at the White House, to make sure these briefings occurred across the new administration and in a timely fashion. One surprise was that Nixon told me that Mitchell could speak for him in all matters if he was not available. Johnson would have never delegated such authority, but that was the difference in the management style of the two men. While a smooth transition was important to Johnson, he didn’t stop being president. He was issuing orders and making appointments right up to the morning of the Inauguration. In fact, the day before the Inauguration the president told me to find out how many vacancies existed on commissions and boards and find good people that he could nominate. He kept Nixon waiting in the Blue Room on Inauguration morning while he signed those nominations (which required Senate confirmation) and had them delivered to the Congress before noon. It is a positive sign that President Obama invited Donald J. Trump to meet at the White House two days after this most contentious election. Today transitions are much more institutional now than our first one in 1968. But this process can heal many wounds and start bringing our country closer together. That’s imperative if we want to make our government work for the people again. Back in 1968, Johnson and Nixon left the White House together, along with Senator Everett Dirksen and me. We jumped into the car and headed to the Capitol. Surprisingly, Nixon wanted only to discuss how disappointed he was to have lost Texas (Johnson’s home state) and how determined he was to win it in1972. I hope the ride to the Capitol next January will be more substantive on policy.  By  Sarah Jaffe  If anything has been made clear by the results of this election, it is that the political and pundit class have underestimated the degree of anger and pain in the United States, the degree to which “recovery” has been recovery for a few and stagnation and decline for many more. One exit poll has been haunting me since I saw it: The Reuters/Ipsos early exit poll found that 75 percent of respondents agreed “America needs a strong leader to take the country back from the rich and powerful.” Only slightly fewer agreed that “the American economy is rigged to advantage the rich and powerful,” and — perhaps the kicker — 68 percent believed that “traditional parties and politicians don’t care about people like me.” There’s a lot to unpack in those statements. They may conceal white resentment of the perceived advancement past them of black and Latino people. But they also reveal the sentiment that has been there since the 2008 financial crisis laid bare the lines of power in the country and the world — when, as the protest chant went, “Banks got bailed out, we got sold out.” The downward trends have been with us for decades: the divergence of productivity gains from workers’ incomes, the substitution of credit card debt for raises, the shift of good union jobs and family wages and pensions into low-wage service jobs, and the attendant slashing of the social safety net. But the past eight years sped all that up and made it impossible to ignore. If Donald J. Trump stood out to voters from the rest of the Republican Party, aside from a willingness to say directly the kinds of things usually carefully dogwhistled, it was in his rants about trade and his lack of interest in dismantling the remnants of the welfare state. For white Americans anxiously looking at their disappearing stability, Mr. Trump was a bomb they were willing to throw at a system they felt was failing them. He emotionally echoed their outrage and gave them a place to direct their anger, the age-old right-wing populist trick of refracting it both upward at elites and downward at minorities. Hillary Clinton’s campaign and the mainstream Democratic Party were woefully unprepared to greet this wave. When your response to a cry of “Make America Great Again!” is “America Is Already Great!” you’d better be sure that it feels true to a majority of voters. The results show that it did not. To be sure, Democrats had an uneasy line to walk, between maintaining continuity with a still-popular, twice-elected Barack Obama — a continuity that won Mrs. Clinton the Democratic primary — and reaching the people who wanted and needed change. But the party’s wholehearted backing of Mrs. Clinton was a colossal misreading of a moment when rage at the establishment (of both parties) was simmering everywhere. That rage should have been visible as Mr. Trump ran away with the Republican nomination process despite the opposition of that party’s grandees, and as Bernie Sanders pushed Mrs. Clinton much harder than anyone had expected a gray-haired socialist from Vermont to do. But Mrs. Clinton opened her arms to disaffected Republicans rather than wooing the disaffected within and around her own party. Most of the television ads she ran were more about painting Trump as a dangerous aberration, an outsider unfit for office, than pitching any plan of her own for change. Democrats failed to realize that for many Trump voters, that was exactly what they liked about him.  By  Will Wilkinson  It may not be an exaggeration to say that Donald Trump both knows and cares less about the details of public policy than anyone ever elected president of the United States. This just goes to show that “politics is not about policy,” as Robin Hanson, the futurist and social theorist, likes to say. Mr. Trump’s playbook against Hillary Clinton broke with the hard-won norms of liberal democracy, went back to demagogic, authoritarian political basics, and updated them for  the reality television, social media age. Politics is, at bottom, about factions vying and coordinating to choose leaders in whom to invest authority. Throughout the campaign, Mr. Trump displayed an uncanny and unnerving mastery of the primal politics of authority, and the game of legitimizing his own and delegitimizing his rivals’ claims to authority. In Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump drew a general election opponent pre-weakened by a decades-long Republican campaign of delegitimization. He took advantage of it with shameless audacity, making the most of our culture’s lingering sexism and the popular perception of Mrs. Clinton as a member of an arrogant and corrupt elite that believes it is above the law. But tearing down his opponents was only half of Trump’s equation. The pundits and pollsters so badly botched their predictions in no small part because they failed to grasp the intense, reality-distorting power of Donald Trump’s fame. But Mr. Trump seems to have an intuitive understanding that glamour, celebrity and gaudy wealth are key ingredients in majesty — which is inherently authoritative and underwrites its own claim to legitimacy. Trump’s self-branded personal jet was more than a convenient means of transportation for a very rich man. It was a purple silk, ermine-fringed cape, Air Force One in waiting, and he knew how to use it. The United States, the world’s first nation founded on principled opposition to the pre-Enlightenment politics of majesty and unified authority, has deep-seated norms of republican modesty and propriety. Casting those norms aside and banking heavily on the atavistic political appeal of majestic celebrity gave Mr. Trump an advantage few us were prepared to acknowledge, allowing him to attract the support of an unforeseen numbers of black, Hispanic and female voters, despite his campaign’s naked racism and his scandalously misogynistic and abusive personal history. Because Mr. Trump’s strategy was so indifferent to matters of policy substance, it is incredibly difficult to say what policies Mr. Trump will actually support in office. I don’t think we’ve ever known less about what an incoming president really wants to do with his power. But we do have a clear indication of how he’s likely to wield it. He will cleverly burnish his claim to authority and relentlessly and effectively discredit his opponents, inside and outside the Republican Party, with all the tools of an executive branch that has never been more powerful and less constrained by the constitutional system America’s founders designed specifically as an alternative to and a bulwark against unitary authority.  By  Lindy West  I got up on Election Day and burst into tears — not a genteel twin trickle but a great heaving burst, zero to firehose. Tears spattered the inside of my glasses, dripped from my lips, and left mascara-tinged rosettes blooming black in my cereal milk. “Honey,” my husband crooned to me. “Honey, it’s going to be O.K. The numbers are still good. It’s O.K.” But it wasn’t the numbers. I wasn’t sobbing because I was afraid Hillary Clinton was going to lose. That would come later. I was sobbing Tuesday morning because, as I poured my coffee, I’d caught a glimpse of a cable news interview with Mrs. Clinton just after she voted for herself in Chappaqua, N.Y. She seemed breathless, exhilarated, a little overwhelmed. Over her shoulder, Bill Clinton stared at his wife and beamed. My husband stares at me like that sometimes. It’s not just love — we expect husbands to love their wives — but something less traditional, more conditional and gendered. It’s professional respect. It’s pride. We’re accustomed to that pride flowing the other direction, from wife to husband, because men in our culture get to be more than just bodies, do more than just nurture. Men get to act and excel and climb and aspire and thrive and win and rule and be the audacious, hungry fulcrum of public life. It is normal for men to have ambition. It is normal for women to stand aside. I thought about Bill Clinton meeting Hillary Rodham at Yale in 1971, and how tenacious and intense she must have been even back then, how undeniable and potent. Mr. Clinton describes the moment in his memoir . “She conveyed a sense of strength and self-possession I had rarely seen in anyone, man or woman,“ he wrote. "She was in my face from the start.” He says he once told her , during those years, “I have met all the most gifted people in our generation and you’re the best.” And then I thought about Mr. Clinton rising steadily through his political career, on the track we have built for charismatic, competent white men. He must have known, every second, how good his wife was. Not just good, but “the best.” Better than everyone he’d ever met; better than him, even. And he watched her stand next to him and wait, and wait, and wait, underestimated and degraded and excoriated for wanting more out of life than cookies. And she didn’t quit! She swallowed slander and humiliation and irrational hatred for three decades and she didn’t quit, and here she was, just a hair’s breadth from the presidency of the United States — the first woman ever to be trusted with the rudder of the world. He must be so proud of her, I thought. It made me cry. I cried because I want my daughters to feel that blazing pride, that affirmation of their boundless capacity — not from their husbands, but from their world, from the atmosphere, from inviolable wells of certainty inside themselves. I cried because it’s not fair, and I’m so tired, and every woman I know is so tired. I cried because I don’t even know what it feels like to be taken seriously — not fully, not in that whole, unequivocal, confident way that’s native to handshakes between men. I cried because it does things to you to always come second. Whatever your personal opinion of the Clintons, as politicians or as human beings, that dynamic is real. We, as a culture, do not take women seriously on a profound level. We do not believe women. We do not trust women. We do not like women. I understand that many men cannot see it, and plenty more do not care. I know that many men will read this and laugh, or become defensive, or call me hysterical, or worse, and that’s fine. I am used to it. It doesn’t make me wrong. But maybe this election was the beginning of something new, I thought. Not the death of sexism, but the birth of a world in which women’s inferiority isn’t a given. That grain of hope glowed inside me until around dinner time on Tuesday, the final day of an election so openly misogynist that the question “Sexual assault: good or bad?” was credulously presented for debate. Today doesn’t feel real. It is indistinguishable from fresh, close grief. But if there’s one lesson we can take from Mrs. Clinton, politics aside — and even Donald Trump acknowledged it in the second debate — it’s the limitlessness of human endurance. Those of us who have been left in the cold by this apparent affirmation of a white supremacist patriarchy (and sorry, white women who voted for Mr. Trump, but your shelter is illusory) are tough. We have been weathering this hurricane wall of doubt and violence for so long, and now, more crystalline than ever, we have an enemy and a mandate. We have the smirking apotheosis of our oppression sliming, paw-first, toward our genitals. We have the popular vote. We have proof, in exit polls, that white women will pawn their humanity for the safety of white supremacy. We have abortion pills to stockpile and neighbors to protect and children to teach. We have the right woman to find. We have local elections in a year. The fact that we lost doesn’t make us wrong; the fact that they don’t believe in us doesn’t make us disappear.  By  Seth Grossman  A couple of years ago, I produced a reality-TV show called “Hollywood Hillbillies,” about a family from rural Georgia who, driven by the grandson’s newfound internet fame, moves west to make it in Hollywood. The show centered on the undeniable charisma of “Mema,” the foul-mouthed matriarch who spoke her mind and poked fun at the habits and attitudes of the Los Angeles elite. The show was part of a wave of “redneck reality” shows like “Swamp People,” “Duck Dynasty,” “Bayou Billionaires” and “Moonshiners” that presented a vision of white, rural America as the last authentic place on earth, the last place untarnished by the corruption and cynicism of the elites. “Hollywood Hillbillies” aired on the Reelz Network, a channel owned by a billionaire Republican donor Stanley Hubbard , who funded a pro-Trump “super” PAC after his preferred candidates lost the primaries. Designed as a harmless comedy, the show reveled in Mema’s provocative, off-color remarks, just as Donald J. Trump’s audience revels in his. But now I’m thinking more critically about what shows like this are selling. All of these shows have one thing in common: While trafficking in rural stereotypes, they celebrate wealth and business success — whether that business is crafting hick-hop music, catching alligators or designing duck calls. Ostensibly produced for middle America, they offer a population disenfranchised by globalization and the information economy a vision of rural ingenuity rewarded. Mr. Trump based his candidacy around this population. He spoke directly to voters raised on reality TV, addressing their fears and aspirations with blunt talk. He became their perfect celebrity champion, a rich white man, his image polished by years in a reality-TV boardroom, who validated their demographic anxiety. In an election season driven more by hatred of political opponents than enthusiasm for two deeply unpopular candidates, President-Elect Donald J. Trump hated best, and won. I am wondering today if the same embarrassment that prevents some of us from admitting that we watch “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” also kept Trump supporters from admitting to pollsters that they were voting for a man they knew the media considered a bigot. Two months ago, I started working on a new series, “Trumpigration,” a travel show about where to move if Donald Trump somehow got elected. That, too, was designed as a lighthearted comedy. Now, facing the prospect of four years of a Trump presidency, it’s beginning to feel like the last chance to change the channel.  By  Roberto Suro  If you are in shock over the election results, don’t blame Latinos. They favored Hillary Clinton by better than two to one, according to the exit polls. They did not turn out in big numbers to protest Donald J. Trump, but it probably would not have mattered. It turns out that Latinos were the election’s biggest losers and not just because Mr. Trump won the presidency after a long campaign of slinging threats and insults at them. The bitterest loss was dealt by the 59.5 million mostly white people who voted for Mr. Trump. That was a rejection by their own countrymen. According to the exit polls — a rough measure of turnout at best — Latinos accounted for 11 percent of the votes cast Tuesday the same as 2012. If those numbers hold, there was little or no Trump effect, and however much the number of Latino votes increased was just a result of demography. You may have been convinced that it would be otherwise. Years of reckless commentary, news stories and advocacy insisted that Latinos would be the great demographic firewall that would safeguard progressive politics with surging population numbers. But, the firewall only stands in a few states, and the biggest of them, California, New York and Texas, are already decided. Mr. Trump concentrated instead on the old industrial states where Latinos are a sparse presence. When he demonized Mexico and unauthorized immigrants, he gained more in the Electoral College by mobilizing white voters than he lost by alienating Latinos. The national exit polls show that Mrs. Clinton drew 65 percent of the Latino vote compared with 29 percent for Mr. Trump. That is a landslide by any measure, and it is about the same margin in the exit polls for 2008 (67 percent vs. 31 percent). The disappointment sets in when you compare the outcome to 2012. President Barack Obama took 71 percent of the Latino vote in the exit polls that year compared with 27 percent for Mitt Romney. Mr. Trump was supposed to be the bucket of cold water that aroused the sleeping giant, producing not only a stronger preference for the Democratic candidate but also, more important, a spike in turnout. In 2012, with immigration reform on the line, more than 12 million Latino voters stayed home, producing a turnout rate of 48 percent compared with 64 percent for whites and 67 percent for blacks. The much ballyhooed and chronicled “Trump Effect” was supposed to have produced a surge in naturalizations and voter registration over the past year, and news organizations were churning out stories about the “surge” in Latino voting even after the polls closed Tuesday. While more time and data is needed to get a full picture of Latino turnout this year, at first glance it appears Latino numbers were up, and perhaps significantly in some places, but that in fact the giant was barely stirred. Four million more Latinos were eligible to vote Tuesday than in 2012. So, no matter who was running and no matter how low the turnout, the number of Latino votes counted Tuesday was virtually certain to be higher than 2012. In fact, demographic growth alone would have guaranteed Mrs. Clinton an additional 1.3 million votes (about 1 percent of the total votes cast), even if turnout remained at the same dismal rate as 2012, and she got two-thirds of the Latino votes. In Colorado and Nevada, Latino voters surely helped keep the states blue, and under different scenarios those states could have served as the much-advertised Latino firewall. The one real bright spot for Latino Democrats Tuesday came with the election of Catherine Cortez Masto to the Senate in Nevada. That vote may illustrate what it takes to wake up the Latino electorate: a charismatic and qualified candidate, strong mediating institutions, in this case the hospitality workers’ unions in Las Vegas, and well-organized political operation like the one created by Senator Harry Reid, the retiring Democratic leader. Meanwhile, something may have happened in Texas that needs a closer look. Mr. Trump won handily, but only by a 9 percent margin. President Obama lost the state by nearly 16 points in 2012 and by almost 12 points in 2008. A lot of non-Latino newcomers have begun to change the political complexion of the state in recent years, and that formula — newcomers plus Latinos — is what flipped Colorado and Nevada in the past. Florida is the one place where Latinos might have been able to change the results of this election and didn’t. In the exit polls, Latinos accounted for 18 percent of the total vote compared with 17 in 2012, and the split was slightly more favorable to Mrs. Clinton than it was for President Obama four years ago. Mrs. Clinton’s vote tally was more than 200,000 higher than President Obama’s, but Mr. Trump’s was more than 400,000 higher than Mr. Romney’s. And therein lies the result that Latinos will have to live with for the next four years. In a state that has vividly benefited from immigration and trade, a state where Latinos have for the most part prospered and contributed to the prosperity of their neighbors, white voters mobilized to elect a candidate who would angrily erase everything Latinos represent. No one else suffered that kind of defeat on Tuesday.  By  Kevin M. Kruse  With so many predictions about this presidential campaign having turned out to be so very wrong, comparisons to the 1948 presidential race come naturally. In that election, virtually everyone predicted that the Republican Thomas Dewey would beat the “accidental president,” the Democrat, Harry Truman. Pollsters reinforced these assumptions. Elmer Roper announced that he was so sure Dewey would win that he wouldn’t even bother reporting poll results anymore. “My silence on this point can be construed as an indication that Mr. Dewey is still so clearly ahead that we might as well just listen to his inaugural address,” he said. George Gallup kept polling until mid-October, but then rested on those results, assuming the race was over. Pundits agreed. Newsweek surveyed 50 of the nation’s top political reporters in October; every single one said Dewey would win. Republicans and Democrats alike assumed the race was over. On election night, the conservative Chicago Tribune was so confident it called the race early, rushing out a banner headline that would soon be as famous as it was wrong: “Dewey Defeats Truman.” To the amazement of nearly everyone, Truman won by considerable margins. In the popular vote, he took 49.6 percent to Dewey’s 45.1 percent. In the Electoral College, he won 303 votes to Dewey’s 189. While the margins of this year’s election are narrower, the shock and confusion of pollsters and analysts seems just as pronounced. But comparisons between the Truman and Trump campaigns are not neatly drawn. Truman was an outspoken liberal, and he campaigned on preserving and expanding the accomplishments of the New Deal welfare state. He called for expansion of Social Security, more progressive forms of taxation, a higher minimum wage, and a new national system of health insurance. Truman also committed the Democratic Party, long dominated by Southern segregationists, to a new racial liberalism. Notably, he called on Congress to protect the voting rights of African-Americans. In foreign policy, Truman set America against the growing influence of the Soviet Union. In 1947, he announced the Truman Doctrine, which prompted economic aid to Europe through the Marshall Plan and military alliances through a new North Atlantic Treaty Organization. A year later, Truman challenged Soviet expansionism with the Berlin Airlift. Mr. Trump has rejected much of the substance of Truman’s campaign, but in many ways he reflected its style. Truman’s famous “whistle-stop campaign” took him to rural communities and small towns where working-class and middle-class whites felt neglected. In fiery speeches with blunt language, he singled out sources of blame. Truman went after the “do nothing” Republican Congress as a prominent foe, but also denounced an array of “special interests,” including “bloodsuckers who have offices on Wall Street.” Truman named these enemies and promised to “give ’em’ hell.” His crowds believed him and rallied to their candidate. On Election Day, he predicted there were would be “a lot of surprised pollsters.” There were. Though he had reason to gloat, Truman was gracious in victory. The day after the election, the Washington Post staff invited him to a “crow banquet.” All the newspaper pundits, radio commentators and pollsters who predicted his defeat would wear sackcloth and force down a main course of crow; the president, in white tie and tails, would be served roast turkey. Truman declined, saying he had “no desire to crow over anybody or to see anybody eat crow, figuratively or otherwise.” He added, “We should all get together now and make a country in which everybody can eat turkey whenever he pleases.” Mr. Trump is not a politician who operates by anyone else’s playbook, but perhaps in this small but important matter, he can take a lesson from history.  By  Maureen Sullivan  I have to admit it: I am loving it. As the results poured in for Donald J. Trump, I reveled in the Facebook friends who openly mourned the end of humanity. I felt gleeful in trolling the Twitter hashtag #HesNotMyPresident: “I’m laying in bed with tears streaming down my face, just thinking about the future of this country.” This was one of the biggest election upsets in history, so of course everyone is stunned. Me too. Switching among three cable news networks and several websites I wondered: Is he really going to take Florida so easily? Did they just call North Carolina for Trump? Can he possibly win Wisconsin? Pennsylvania? Yup. I rooted for Mitt Romney in 2012 and John McCain in 2008. I ran for the school board in Hoboken, N.J., and lost once before winning the following year. I know what it’s like to have your hopes puddle up on the floor like that dollop of election-night Haagen-Dazs that you dropped and you just don’t care to wipe up. What does it matter? All is lost. You want to announce on Twitter that you are in bed letting the tears stream down your face. I saw this result coming over the summer. In July, five police officers were ambushed in Dallas and three more were killed in Baton Rouge. In August, Colin Kaepernick, the San Francisco 49ers quarterback, sat out the national anthem. In September, an Islamic terrorist, masquerading as a fried chicken salesman in my hometown, Elizabeth, N.J., set off bombs in New York and New Jersey. Mrs. Clinton proclaimed: “I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police.” She put half of Trump’s supporters in that “basket of deplorables.” People I know were angry. They were tired of being told they were racist and bigoted as they went about the business of mowing their lawns, writing college tuition checks and working their jobs as cops, secretaries and teachers’ aides. They kept being told they needed to look inward, examine their sins and judge themselves guilty. They had not forgotten when Barack Obama was running for president in 2008 and his wife, Michelle, said, “For the first time in my adult lifetime, I’m really proud of my country…” So now we have President-Elect Donald Trump. I supported him because he promised to curb regulations, cut taxes and appoint constitutionalists to the Supreme Court. I supported him because Mrs. Clinton doesn’t have what it takes to turn around a stagnant economy or stand up to the special interests that block innovation. In his victory speech, Mr. Trump lifted a line from Abraham Lincoln and spoke of “binding wounds.” I wanted him to be gracious and kind in that moment, and he was. My 89-year-old mother is still appalled by my vote and tells me, with a laugh, that she’s moving to Ireland. And one of my disappointed female friends on Facebook — who, like me is white and college-educated — wrote, “Obama helped expose the deeply racist nature of our country. Trump exposes the anti-intellectual, sexist xenophobia.” But most of my friends, some of whom I suspect cast votes like mine, have stayed quiet. I guess it’s still not politically correct to admit that you are on the Trump train.  By  Viet Thanh Nguyen  Worst-case scenario in the next four years: fascism, a wall, mass deportations, the end of Obamacare, a Trump brand on the White House and either a trade war or an actual war with China (since war is the easiest diversion from domestic unhappiness). Best-case scenario: Ruth Bader Ginsburg refuses to retire or die, the Democratic Party finds a backbone, turns away from its fixation on the center and heeds the call for an economic revolt against the 1 percent, joined by Black Lives Matter, the Occupy movement, and resurgent feminism. Both scenarios could happen at the same time. The second scenario requires Democrats to put their status quo political model to rest. They already had a significant portion of the nonwhite minority vote locked up, but have lost too many working-class white people. Bernie Sanders might not have won over the wealthier whites who were voting with Trump against the seemingly rising tide of minorities, but he might have snared the white working class and some of the white middle class. Here’s the bright side, for those, like me, who are on the liberal-to-left spectrum. If Hillary Clinton had won, she would have run again in 2020, which could have meant four more years of Wall Street liberalism and fire-and-forget perpetual warfare, conducted by drones and Special Operations over the horizon. Now perhaps Elizabeth Warren will be the 2020 Democratic candidate — a white woman, a feminist, and someone more progressive than Clinton. But all this speaks largely about domestic electoral politics. The sickness of the American body politic remains untreated, and will remain untreated, or exacerbated, in a country run by clowns, conspirators, and collaborators. That sickness is imperialism. America is an imperial country, and its decay might now be showing. The power that has brought so much benefit to the country — for white people — is now faltering in its ability to provide those benefits to all white people. The empire’s best hope is to be more inclusive, demographically and economically, but that runs counter to the imperial impulse to hoard power and profit. Warren or someone like her might be better at extracting more social and economic justice for all Americans. But unless such a person finds a way to ease control from the financial-industrial complex, the prospects of halting our decline are weak. Empires rot from the inside even as emperors blame the barbarians.  By  Robert N. Stavins  Donald J. Trump once tweeted that “the concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing noncompetitive.” Twitter messages may not be clear signs of likely public policies, but Mr. Trump followed up during the campaign with his “America First Energy Plan,” which would rescind all of President Obama’s actions on climate change. The plan includes canceling United States participation in the Paris climate agreement and stopping all American funding of United Nations climate change programs. It also includes abandoning the Clean Power Plan, a mainstay of the Obama administration’s approach to achieving its emissions reduction target for carbon dioxide under the Paris agreement. What should we make of such campaign promises? Taking Mr. Trump at his word, he will surely seek to pull the country out of the Paris pact. But because the agreement has already come into force, under the rules, any party must wait three years before requesting to withdraw, followed by a one-year notice period. Those rules would seem to be mere technicalities. The incoming Trump administration simply can disregard America’s pledge to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 26 to 28 percent below the 2005 level by 2025. That is bad enough. But the big worry is what other key countries, including the world’s largest emitter, China, as well as India and Brazil, will do if the United States reneges on its pledge. The result could be that the Paris agreement unravels, taking it from the 97 percent of global emissions currently covered by the pact to little more than the European Union’s 10 percent share. In addition, Mr. Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency probably will stop work on regulations of methane emissions (a very potent greenhouse gas) from existing oil and gas operations. Undoing complex existing regulations, such as the Clean Power Plan, will be more difficult, but a reconstituted Supreme Court will probably help President Trump when that plan inevitably comes before the court. Also, the new president will most likely ask that the Keystone XL pipeline permit application be renewed — and facilitate other oil and gas pipelines around the country. On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump promised to “bring back” the coal industry by cutting environmental regulations. That may not be so easy. The decline of that industry and related employment has been caused by technological changes in mining, and competition from low-priced natural gas for electricity generation, not by environmental regulations. At the same time, Mr. Trump has pledged to promote fracking for oil and gas, but that would make natural gas even more economically attractive, and accelerate the elimination of coal-sector jobs. If he lives up to his campaign rhetoric, Mr. Trump may indeed be able to reverse course on climate change policy, increasing the threat to our planet, and in the process destroy much of the Obama legacy in this important realm. This will make the states even more important players on this critical issue.  By  Dani Rodrik  The real costs of a Donald J. Trump presidency will most likely come on the political rather than on the economic side. We are likely to see some rise in trade barriers and unilateral economic policies. But for all his bluster, I do not expect Mr. Trump to engage in indiscriminate protectionism. We live in a world of supply chains where imposing tariffs on Mexican or Chinese imports will raise costs of United States businesses and make it hard for them to compete. Mr. Trump is a businessman, and he will understand soon, if he does not now, the senselessness of blanket protectionism. We may have plenty of trade disputes with foreign countries. It’s useful to bear in mind here the example of the 1980s, when trade frictions with Japan and other leading exporters produced a slew of so-called new protectionist barriers such as voluntary export restraints. But these did very limited damage to the world economy. Before long, the world embarked on a further and more intense round of globalization. Furthermore, we have robust international institutions, like the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization, that did not exist in the interwar period. And the political lobbies in favor of an open economy (big business and banks) are stronger and retain considerable influence in Washington. So even though the 1930s parallel is on everyone’s mind, I do not think we are in for a collapse of the international economic order and a retreat into trade war. The real danger Mr. Trump poses is the undermining of our politics — the norms that sustain our liberal democracies. His campaign was based on a divisive politics of identity. Ideals of equity, equal rights, diversity and inclusion were submerged under the weight of a rhetoric that raised racial and ethnic tensions and inflamed passions against imagined enemies — Mexican immigrants, Chinese exporters, Muslim refugees. Illiberal democracy has been the bane of several nations around the world. Under Mr. Trump, the traditions in the United States of checks and balances and of rule of law will be tested seriously. The political danger will be greatly magnified by Mr. Trump’s likely economic failure. He comes into office as the putative leader of middle and lower classes who feel they have been left behind. He has raised their expectations in ways that he cannot meet. There is little chance that incomes at the middle and lower end of income distribution will receive a large boost under his policies. The manufacturing jobs that have left will not return no matter how tough Mr. Trump’s trade policies get. These jobs have disappeared for good, largely thanks to technological changes, and not trade. When the full scale of his economic disappointment sinks in sometime during his term, Mr. Trump may well react in the time-honored fashion of global populists like President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. To keep his base mobilized and insulate himself from economic troubles, he may take shelter in an intensified form of the identity politics that worked so well for him during the presidential campaign. This would rip American society further apart along racial and ethnic cleavages. The ugliness that characterized politics during the presidential campaign may be nothing compared with what may be yet to come.  By  Teresa Tritch  Financial markets regained their footing on Wednesday, as investors and traders apparently concluded that a Donald Trump presidency might not be so bad after all. Instead of focusing on how unprepared Mr. Trump is to be president, several traders quoted in the media talked about how deregulation from ending Obamacare and the Dodd-Frank financial reforms — two Republican goals — could lift stock prices for health care companies and banks. They took special solace in Mr. Trump’s promise to boost government spending on infrastructure and in the measured tones of his acceptance speech. Unfortunately, there is no escaping the overarching conclusion that Mr. Trump’s campaign promises, if carried out, would harm the economy. His proposed rollback of Dodd-Frank reforms would invite renewed recklessness. His opposition to Obamacare would renew and intensify households’ financial insecurity. His proposed tax cuts for the rich would exacerbate income inequality, while either blowing a hole in the deficit or requiring deep budget cuts. His stance on trade would impair international commerce and cooperation. His proposed deportation of immigrants would unleash a legal and humanitarian crisis. Even his popular call for more infrastructure spending is flawed. In and of itself, Mr. Trump’s pledge to borrow vast sums to spend on infrastructure would be a sensible move at this time of low interest rates. But vastly increased federal indebtedness in addition to his other harmful economic policies would be piling risk on top of risk. Risk-taking that crosses the line into recklessness can be immensely profitable in the short run, which is what many traders care most about. But it is no way to run an economy on which everyone else depends for long-term prosperity.  By  Emily Bazelon  Now it looks like a warning shot. When Justice Antonin Scalia died in February, Donald Trump was among the first to call for stonewalling President Obama’s choice to fill the seat. “It’s called delay, delay, delay,” he said at the opening of the Republican presidential debate on Feb. 13. Senator Harry Reid, the minority leader, countered that it would be “unprecedented in recent history” for the Supreme Court to go a year without a full complement of justices. But other Republicans, chief among them the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, agreed with Mr. Trump and Senator Ted Cruz: Justice Scalia’s seat should remain vacant until after the election. Undeterred (what else was he supposed to be?), President Obama nominated Merrick Garland, a seasoned judge praised in the past by Republicans like Senator Orrin Hatch. A debate ensued over historical facts, which seems quaintly polite in retrospect. Since 1900, had the Senate ever refused to confirm a nominee in a presidential election year as a result of the impending election? The answer was no (even if Mr. Cruz tried to argue, against the facts, that Justice Anthony Kennedy wasn’t confirmed in the election year of 1988.) The Republicans’ refusal to grant Judge Garland a hearing or schedule a vote was in fact unprecedented. It was a new kind of hardball. And it succeeded. For a blip in August, Republicans took a hit in the polls for  obstructing the Garland nomination. But the moment passed, blown away in the chaos and battle of the presidential election. Judge Garland slipped from view. The parties adapted to a new reality in which both expected either his postelection, pre-inauguration confirmation, or a new nominee chosen by the next president. When they assumed Hillary Clinton would win, Republicans including Senators John McCain of Arizona  and Richard Burr of North Carolina talked about blocking Democratic Supreme Court picks indefinitely. Both were re-elected Tuesday and will return to a Senate still controlled by the Republicans. It’s hard to see how any Republican paid a price for radically altering the norms for Supreme Court appointments. Mr. Trump helped point the way, and the voters rewarded him and those who followed. Choosing a justice in Antonin Scalia’s mold, as he has promised, will allow Mr. Trump to prove himself to the social conservatives for whom the court, and Roe v. Wade, are the defining issues. Under the current rules, Democrats could filibuster his choice, but if that happens, how long will those rules last? 
Mr. Trump’s election has already run over far stronger traditions and norms. Next comes the question of how many additional Supreme Court appointments will come his way. Ruth Bader Ginsburg is 83. Anthony Kennedy is 80. Stephen Breyer is 78. In Supreme Court terms, four years is a long time.  By  Peter Wehner  To say that Donald Trump’s victory was a shock may qualify as the understatement of the century. The polls were wrong. The experts were wrong. I was wrong. Almost everyone was wrong — including those in the Trump campaign who expected to lose. His victory wasn’t just a surprise; it was an event of gigantic dimensions, its radiating effects incalculable. Mr. Trump’s win ranks among the most unlikely and stunning elections in American history. Regardless of how the Trump presidency turns out, this race will be studied a century from now. For those of us who have been vehement critics of Mr. Trump, this is a rather challenging moment. Starting on Jan. 20, he will be the only president we have. He now has a democratic legitimacy we may regret but cannot deny, and there is such a thing as democratic grace. To those who are tempted only to rage and attack and lament what has occurred, a word of counsel to them, and to myself: We need to give Mr. Trump the chance to rise to the moment, as unlikely as we think that may be. At the same time, we can’t possibly erase the history of the last 17 months — the words he said, the things he did, the conspiracy theories he wove, the ignorance, volatility and cruelty he showed — and our concerns aren’t going to evaporate now that he’s about to be in charge of the nuclear triad that during the campaign he didn’t even know existed. I believed, and still believe, that he is a man with a disordered personality and authoritarian tendencies. My job is to give him a chance to prove me wrong; his job is to prove me wrong. Among my worries is that Mr. Trump’s victory will validate his style of politics, his serrated rhetoric. The way he mistreats people will be normalized. This election has brought us to dark places. Rather than this approach being repudiated it will, for many, become a model. “All the decent drapery of life is to be rudely torn off,” in the words of Edmund Burke. If the Trump campaign foreshadows his presidency, America under Trump will be fundamentally different than it has been — coarser, less temperate and civilized, more inward and resentful. The Republican Party will fundamentally change, from a conservative party to one that champions European-style ethnic nationalism. (The Democratic Party, whose members were certain Hillary Clinton would win, will be convulsed as it enters a period of intense recrimination.) A few hours after Mr. Trump was declared the winner, I received a note from a friend of mine, the distinguished Christian writer Philip Yancey, who told me, “I’m surprised and befuddled, but not scared, thanks to the checks-and-balances strength of American democracy. I tremble, though, to think what an unpredictable leader offers to a world in growing crisis.” He added, “Some say God moves in mysterious ways.  I say, God grants humans the freedom to move in even more mysterious ways.” What happened on Nov. 8th was a mystery that may lead to calamity. I hope to God it won’t.  By  Anna North  I spent the days leading up to the election in Pennsylvania talking to some young voters , 18, 19, 20 years old. They wore flowered Doc Martens, fake fur coats, earbuds dangling from one ear. Overwhelmingly, they were open and polite. They were smart. They were angry at a political system they felt ignored them, but they hoped for better days ahead. In January, Donald Trump will be their next president. Many of these young people supported Mr. Trump. Many did so reluctantly. One young Trump supporter told me that no one knows exactly what Mr. Trump will do in office. Another described hesitating while filling out his absentee ballot, wondering if he could vote for a man who had made abhorrent comments about women. But some voted for Mr. Trump enthusiastically. Those who supported Hillary Clinton were disgusted by Mr. Trump and what he stands for. Today, they’re dealing with a new reality they didn’t expect. I’m thinking of Bria Blackshear, a 20-year-old Temple University student who had waited more than an hour at her polling place in north Philadelphia. “Donald Trump doesn’t represent the ideals I would want for this country,” she said. I’m thinking of Brooke Renner, 18, also a Temple student, who was waiting in line for a second time. She’d given up earlier, but was back and willing to wait as long as it took to cast her vote for Mrs. Clinton. Otherwise, she said, “I’d feel personally responsible if Donald Trump wins.” I’m thinking of Sierra Taylor, a 19-year-old student at the Community College of Philadelphia, who said, “black people feel like our votes don’t matter.” I’m thinking of her friend Naiya Johnson, 22, who, when asked about her hopes for the next four years, said, “I hope we make it.” I’m also thinking of the young people I saw debating the issues that matter to them. Of the table full of young men at Bucks County Community College arguing about Mr. Trump when one, the quietest, spoke up to say, “Trump has no respect for women.” Of the young man, who, as his friend criticized Mrs. Clinton’s record as secretary of state, interjected that Mr. Trump is racist, sexist and xenophobic. They’d had the argument once before, they said. I hope they keep talking. I think they will. It’s a frightening time to grow up. But these young voters are clear-eyed about the shortcomings of government and optimistic enough to imagine a better world. They can make friends with people of different viewpoints, and, when it matters, they can challenge their friends to think in a new way.  By  Seamus McGraw  BRODHEADSVILLE, Pa. — Thinking back now, I can’t for the life of me figure out how I got it so wrong. He seemed so troubled by what he was about to do, as if he knew it was a mistake, but one he felt compelled to make. The way I read the pained look on his face, I thought he was almost apologizing; maybe seeking a kind of absolution. It was just a few days before the election, and I had been canvassing for the Democrats. I wasn’t out there because I was a particularly ardent Clinton supporter. She had certainly not been my first choice, my second or even my third. I’m one of those middle-aged white men without a college degree who had been holding out for Joe Biden to change his mind. But I felt as if I had an obligation to make certain that, at least in my little corner of Pennsylvania, a man who was, to my mind, so obviously unsuited to the highest office in the world, was not just defeated, but repudiated. I expected that my neighbors and friends and the strangers down the road would do just that. Sure, I could feel and even share their frustration over the fact that the longest postwar economic recovery had left so many of my neighbors behind. I had been left behind, too. And yes, I understood the fear of an uncertain world, and the stress of profound cultural changes that were upending so many things that my neighbors took as bedrock values. But I thought the character traits that had always defined the people I knew in eastern Pennsylvania — true conservatives with a sense of responsibility and decency — would in the end lead them to reject “Trumpism,” whatever that actually is. My job wasn’t to help Clinton win. I thought — or at least the pundits were telling me — that was a done deal. The way I saw it, my only task was to drive up her margins and to do that, I was working off a carefully curated list of likely Clinton voters thoughtfully provided to me by the local campaign office. And so when I knocked on this gentleman’s door on a back road in the rural, conservative West End of Monroe County, and he told me that he was indeed planning on voting for Donald Trump, I was ready to simply turn away. But he wouldn’t let me go. “I just can’t trust her,” he said. He made eye contact and kept it. Relentlessly. He and I were of the same rough demographic. Just like me, he was well into his 50s, with teeth that had seen better days. Just like me, he was lower middle class, judging from his surroundings. And as he rattled off a list of shopworn talking points — Benghazi, emails, pay for play — I felt as if I was hearing a stranger’s confession. I felt as if he wanted me to understand and forgive him for what he was about to do. I remember thinking to myself that when this was over, I was going to have to find a way to build a bridge back to this guy who was, in so many ways, just like me. Such was my arrogance. Late last night, as I watched Pennsylvania turn red for the first time in a generation, I kept thinking back to that man, and how I so misread his expression and his words. It wasn’t sorrow etched in his face. It was pity. For me. Because he knew, long before I did, how wrong I was.  —  Seamus McGraw is the author of “Betting the Farm on a Drought.”   By  Beverly Gage  In his victory speech last night, Donald J. Trump paid homage to “the forgotten men and women of our country,” vowing that they “will be forgotten no longer.” This essential political idea — that a vast segment of the nation’s white citizens have been overlooked, or looked down upon — has driven every major realignment in American politics since the New Deal. In 1932, at the darkest moment of the Great Depression, Franklin Roosevelt evoked the “forgotten man” as a reason to rebuild the economy from the “bottom up.” More than three decades later, after Richard Nixon’s 1968 victory, the journalist Peter Schrag identified the “Forgotten American” — the white “lower middle class” voter — as the key to the nation’s apparent rejection of the Great Society and the New Deal order. “In the guise of the working class — or the American yeoman or John Smith — he was once the hero of the civic books, the man that Andrew Jackson called ‘the bone and sinew of the country,’ ” Mr. Schrag wrote. “Now he is ‘the forgotten man,’ perhaps the most alienated person in America.” That this “forgotten” American could be used both to uphold and to dismantle liberalism suggests that this American political identity has never been especially fixed: Democrat or Republican, liberal or conservative, but populist above all. Since the 1960s, the phrase has also implied that the country was paying too much attention to the wrong sorts of people — most notably, to African-Americans — at the expense of the white working class.
It is no coincidence that the “forgotten men and women of our country” began their migration into the Republican Party at the very moment that African-Americans were asserting their right to vote, and voting Democratic, in large numbers for the first time. Mr. Trump’s victory will go down as one of the great upsets in United States history, but it is also the product of a long and bitter struggle over race and class in this country. The Yale sociologist William Graham Sumner is often credited with coining the term “forgotten man.” Writing near the dawn of the Progressive Era, he lamented the lost autonomy of hard-working citizens suddenly forced to pay for high-flown programs of social reform. Sumner’s most famous political essay, “What the Social Classes Owe to Each Other,” rejected the very idea that government might mitigate class antagonisms by sharing the social wealth. What did social classes owe to each other? Not much, in Sumner’s view. And his “forgotten man” owed the least of all. In his 1932 campaign for the presidency, Roosevelt sought to claim the term for a different and more expansive purpose. “These unhappy times call for the building of plans that rest upon the forgotten,” he said in a radio address from Albany in April 1932, for plans “that build from the bottom up and not from the top down, that put their faith once more in the forgotten man at the bottom of the economic pyramid.” To Roosevelt, the “forgotten man” encompassed the industrial worker and struggling farmer and Keynesian consumer — ordinary citizens without whom a modern economy would falter. He built the New Deal around this image, establishing the minimum wage, Social Security and the federal right to organize unions. Those reforms cemented the loyalty of the white working class to the Democratic Party for a generation. But the New Deal also “forgot” — or excluded — many people, including African-Americans. When the Great Society came along, Lyndon Johnson tried to make up for that by expanding federal programs serving the poor and by championing the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts. As the country started to “remember” its long-delayed promises of equality, however, the “forgotten American” began to emerge as term of exclusion and resistance to change. “There is hardly a language to describe him, or even a set of social statistics,” Mr. Schrag wrote in his August 1969 essay, “ The Forgotten American .” “Just names: racist-bigot-redneck-ethnic-Irish-Italian-Pole-Hunkie-Yahoo. The lower middle class. A blank.” As Mr. Schrag noted, all of that name-calling was part of the problem, a refusal on the part of liberal elites to recognize the real grievances and desires of what had once been a bedrock Democratic constituency. In the 1968 campaign, Nixon capitalized on this resentment with calls for “law and order,” a phrase that evoked not only fears of crime, but also anger at protesters and rioters and the college-campus liberals who tolerated them. Mr. Trump put that phrase back into political circulation in 2016, a gesture of solidarity with the old ways of thinking about the “silent majority” — and the “forgotten American.” And though he included “men and women” in his victory speech, Mr. Trump’s campaign mobilized around the same image that once animated the Roosevelt coalition: the “forgotten” white working-class man. Race, too, remains an indelible part of today’s conversation about who has been “forgotten” and who deserves to be seen. To dismiss this language as simple racism, however, is to miss at least some of its political significance. What happened in the late 1960s and 1970s was not only that the Republican Party reclaimed and redefined Roosevelt’s “forgotten man” for a more conservative age. During those years, the Democratic Party itself began to turn away from the New Deal and its working-class politics, especially from its commitment to organized labor. With Mr. Trump’s election, we may be witnessing the rise of a new party system, with the Democrats now the standard-bearers of racial tolerance and free-market globalization, and the Republicans the party of nationalist populist revolt. But as Roosevelt showed, this need not be a fixed political equation. If the 2016 election marks the final, gasping end of the New Deal coalition, it should also mark the start of a new reckoning within the Democratic Party.  By  Helen Lewis  LONDON — You can’t throw a peanut in a Westminster pub without hitting an obsessive follower of American politics. Start a conversation about “The West Wing” with any member of Parliament and expect to get a long disquisition on that American political drama’s best episodes. During Britain’s last general election, in 2015, both main political parties here proudly boasted about being advised by veterans of Barack Obama’s campaign. Until now, our Americophilia has been unrequited. Then in August, Donald J. Trump declared himself “Mr. Brexit.” For Mr. Trump and his supporters, Britain’s vote in June to leave the European Union was evidence of a growing popular revolt against multiculturalism, porous borders and political elites. If the British electorate could deliver a result that baffled its financial sector, its scientists and metropolitan liberals – and was not widely predicted by pollsters – couldn’t the same sort of upset happen in America? It just did. Mr. Trump’s victory feels like a flashback to June, although where Brexit divided members of Britain’s political class, the American election results have united them. Politicians of the mainstream right and left alike are dumbfounded that the United States  would elect someone who uses the extreme language Mr. Trump does and who seems to have little love for institutions like NATO. Last December, Britain’s former Conservative prime minister, David Cameron, described Mr. Trump’s proposed ban on Muslims entering America as “divisive, stupid and wrong.” The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan of the Labour Party, has called the president-elect’s views on Islam “ignorant.” Apart from Nigel Farage, the face of the far-right U.K. Independence Party, it is difficult to find a British politician with a good word to say about Mr. Trump. Nationalism, white anger and protectionism are now driving politics in Britain and across Europe. The sound is of doors slamming. Brexit felt like a referendum on border control, and on rapid demographic change among white communities that felt themselves deprived of attention and resources. It is tempting to draw comparisons with the United States: The big cities in both Britain and the United States, which are most diverse, are also most relaxed about that diversity. In smaller communities, immigration feels more disruptive. There are other parallels. Mr. Trump’s victory was driven by older, white voters, who were struggling but not destitute. He won white men without college degrees by a landslide. A typical Leave supporter has a similar demographic profile. Such voters are on the decline, as both Britain and the United States become more diverse and younger generations are better-educated, and more open to immigration and change. But as both the Brexit vote and Mr. Trump’s victory showed, they are far from a spent force.  By  Susan Chira  Women, as Hillary Clinton showed this morning , know how to absorb pain. And Mrs. Clinton has had plenty of practice about how to stand before the cameras after public humiliation. Clearly, she needed time to compose herself. She made no appearances overnight, instead calling Donald J. Trump to concede. But when she strode onstage in purple and gray, Bill Clinton behind her in a purple tie, her voice did not waver. Women seldom have the luxury of giving in to pain. Many have children or grandchildren or aging parents to tend, whether they themselves are sick or in emotional turmoil. So Mrs. Clinton faced her despondent campaign staff and her despondent half of the country and tried to rally them. She spoke most directly to young people, and to women and girls. She had hoped to stand before them as a symbol of all that women could achieve. Now she had to demonstrate once again what women can endure. “I’ve had successes and setbacks, sometimes really painful ones,” she told them. It was hard not to recall her standing beside Bill Clinton after the whole world knew graphic and humiliating details about the affairs he had denied having. “To all the women and especially the young women who put their faith in me I want you to know that nothing has made me prouder than to be your champion,” she said, and here she had to clear her throat. “I know we still have not shattered that highest and hardest glass ceiling but some day somebody will, and hopefully sooner than we might think right now.” It’s difficult to know right now all that stood in the way of shattering that ceiling. Was it a woman, or this woman? Was it Mrs. Clinton as symbol of the Washington establishment, as a consummate insider in a time of profound distrust of the elite? We do know that voters disproportionately punish women who are seen as dishonest. We do know that it’s hard for strong, assertive and ambitious women to be seen as likable and competent at the same time. Political scientists and cultural commentators will long debate what happened in this election, to this woman and to many women.  The question is whether the image of Mrs. Clinton, composed and gracious in defeat, persevering through pain, will inspire women to try again?  By  Felix Salmon  Markets always move after seismic events, like the unexpected election of Donald J. Trump. Still, market moves need to be interpreted. Even if you believe that markets are right, it’s not always obvious what they’re saying. One way to think about the market’s gyrations is the idea of mean and variation. When Barack Obama (a.k.a. No Drama Obama) was elected president, it was possible to anticipate — correctly, it turned out — that he would help steer America back onto a course of steady growth, low inflation and falling unemployment. Think of that as the Obama mean: the baseline expectation. When the stock market expects good things like that, it tends to rise, just as it has during the Obama presidency. But the variation is just as important as the mean. Mr. Obama didn’t always give the markets what they wanted, but by the same token he was always clear about what he was going to do. He promised them something much more valuable: a low-risk upward economic trajectory. Mr. Trump is the exact opposite of Mr. Obama. His baseline is worse, for starters: to establish expectations for his presidency, you have to factor in his hugely irresponsible fiscal policy, potential trade wars and maybe even reckless brinkmanship over repaying the national debt. Put those things together, and a severe recession becomes possible. But it gets even worse because Mr. Trump is by his nature highly unpredictable. However bad you think he’s going to be, it’s entirely possible that your prediction will turn out to be ridiculously optimistic. Mr. Trump has vastly more downside risk than Mr. Obama ever had, and so markets are going to trade at a discount to his already-discounted baseline. If you transition, then, from low-risk positive expectations to high-risk negative expectations, you have to expect the markets to take some precipitous plunges along the way. Much of that will be noise. The markets always fluctuate randomly in the short term, and there’s no point in trying to read anything meaningful into those moves. That’s why it’s dangerous to read too much into midnight stock-market futures trading, or a sudden plunge in the value of the Mexican peso once it becomes obvious that Mr. Trump will become president. Those moves might be a rational response to the lower expected value of the assets in question. On the other hand, they might just be the result of panicky hedging — or indeed they could simply represent dealers second-guessing and trying to outmaneuver one another. Once the market has been trading steadily for a few months, its general direction under the auspices of the new government is going to be pretty clear. Fluctuations over just a few hours, by contrast, are much harder to read. They might look like signals — but all too often they turn out to be nothing but noise. And as we’ve learned during this long, brutal election, separating noise from signals can be a very tricky business.  By  Michael Lerner  It turns out that shaming the supporters of Donald J. Trump is not a good political strategy. Though job loss and economic stagnation played a role in his victory, so did shame. As the principal investigator on a study of the middle class for the National Institute of Mental Health, I found that working people’s stress is often intensified by shame at their failure to “make it” in what they are taught is a meritocratic American economy. The right has been very successful at persuading working people that they are vulnerable not because they themselves have failed, but because of the selfishness of some other villain (African-Americans, feminists, immigrants, Muslims, Jews, liberals, progressives; the list keeps growing). Instead of challenging this ideology of shame, the left has buttressed it by blaming white people as a whole for slavery, genocide of the Native Americans and a host of other sins, as though whiteness itself was something about which people ought to be ashamed. The rage many white working-class people feel in response is rooted in the sense that once again, as has happened to them throughout their lives, they are being misunderstood. So please understand what is happening here. Many Trump supporters very legitimately feel that it is they who have been facing an unfair reality. The upper 20 percent of income earners, many of them quite liberal and rightly committed to the defense of minorities and immigrants, also believe in the economic meritocracy and their own right to have so much more than those who are less fortunate. So while they may be progressive on issues of discrimination against the obvious victims of racism and sexism, they are blind to their own class privilege and to the hidden injuries of class that are internalized by much of the country as self-blame. The right’s ability to portray liberals as elitists is further strengthened by the phobia toward religion that prevails in the left. Many religious people are drawn by the teachings of their tradition to humane values and caring about the oppressed. Yet they often find that liberal culture is hostile to religion of any sort, believing it is irrational and filled with hate. People on the left rarely open themselves to the possibility that there could be a spiritual crisis in society that plays a role in the lives of many who feel misunderstood and denigrated by the fancy intellectuals and radical activists. The left needs to stop ignoring people’s inner pain and fear. The racism, sexism and xenophobia used by Mr. Trump to advance his candidacy does not reveal an inherent malice in the majority of Americans. If the left could abandon all this shaming, it could rebuild its political base by helping Americans see that much of people’s suffering is rooted in the hidden injuries of class and in the spiritual crisis that the global competitive marketplace generates. Democrats need to become as conscious and articulate about the suffering caused by classism as we are about other forms of suffering. We need to reach out to Trump voters in a spirit of empathy and contrition. Only then can we help working people understand that they do not live in a meritocracy, that their intuition that the system is rigged is correct (but it is not by those whom they had been taught to blame) and that their pain and rage is legitimate."
"The Guardian view on Trump’s national security strategy: a veneer of credibility","Tue 19 Dec 2017 19.39 GMT   Last modified on Fri 9 Feb 2018 18.35 GMT   I gnore the title: it is not really a strategy. Nor will it safeguard America’s national security. Instead, the national security strategy which Donald Trump unveiled on Monday is an attempt to patch together a worldview and corresponding plan of action from the US president’s public statements – plus the better judgment of those around him. It is the grown-ups (who remain in the room for now, at least) creating a veneer of credibility for this erratic and dangerous administration and attempting to build some sort of framework for decision-making; it is unlikely to be observed. Producing the document is a legal requirement. Abiding by it is not. Many former officials acknowledge they paid scant attention to its predecessors. It is in large part a paper exercise, but not meaningless. At best, it can force an administration to step away from the urgent but ultimately less important matters to look at the big picture, and to consider how multiple and often competing priorities relate. At other times – as with the George W Bush administration before the Iraq War – it lays out US thinking. This administration has no body of thought; merely a crazy-quilt of ideas and assertions, as is evident from the frequency with which its members contradict each other. The strategy is Trumpian in its brash branding: “AMERICA is DETERMINED to WIN!” he wrote on Twitter. It is Trumpian in its money-mindedness, skewing towards economic issues, and dropping climate change from the list of global threats. It is Trumpian in its general tone of both gloom and hawkishness – with its declaration that Russia and China are “revisionist” powers trying to “shape a world antithetical to US values and interests”. The criticism of Moscow is striking because it is so rare. But it was not echoed in Mr Trump’s remarks. The document accuses Russia of interfering in the domestic political affairs of other countries without mentioning the evidence of its meddling in the 2016 election, which the president rejects , let alone Robert Mueller’s investigation into his campaign’s alleged collusion, which he denies. He and his supporters have attacked the inquiry relentlessly. Few expect a tougher stance on Russia in practice. The remarks on China are milder than predicted – and the document acknowledges the need to cooperate with both countries. Beijing will wait to see what, if any, action is taken before responding. But the underlying issue is undeniable. China is growing more powerful and more confident in its power. It wants to redraw international rules accordingly. This is the hardest of challenges for other powers, most of all the US; and it is complicated by the fact that America still needs China in handling issues such as North Korea. Moscow and Beijing’s own actions have provoked much of the alarm and hostility they now face. The Obama administration did not find an adequate response, and its hopes of resetting the relationships and achieving wide-ranging, constructive engagement proved doomed. But it was serious in examining the problems and it never imagined that personal chemistry or a few bellowed threats would solve them. In contrast, Mr Trump has talked tough but has smoothed the path for China, diminishing his nation through his bigotry, ignorance, bluster and unreliability. Needing to strengthen alliances, he has frayed them. Ditching the flawed Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement without offering an alternative vision of US engagement in the region left the field open. His bellicose rhetoric on Pyongyang has frightened old friends. He has hectored Japan and South Korea about economic and other disagreements, threatening to tear up the free trade deal with Seoul. Further afield, he cosies up to authoritarian leaders and appears disengaged from – even disdainful of – those usually regarded as sharing US values. Meanwhile, some of those around him continue their attempts to normalise an abnormal administration. If the world is lucky the grown-ups will be at least partially successful – dodging a trade war with China (not in either country’s interest) or the much more frightening prospect of an actual war with North Korea or Iran. They carry the weight of Atlas, but their task is Sisyphean in its unending nature. A strategy requires coherence and at least the intention of consistency in carrying it through. Neither aspect is possible while Mr Trump remains in office. Whim, half-digested advice from all-comers, wishful thinking and reflex reactions will continue to carry the day."
"US, Russia clash over terms of deal on Syria chemical weapons – live updates","Matthew Weaver and  Tom McCarthy  Tue 10 Sep 2013 23.45 BST    First published on Tue 10 Sep 2013 08.43 BST     11.45pm BST  This blog has now ended. Follow our live coverage of Obama's television address to the US here.  10.59pm BST  Here's a summary of where things stand: • It was a second day of accelerated diplomatic activity. However a proposed new UN resolution ran into immediate complications. The resolution would require Syrian president Bashar Assad to turn his chemical weapons arsenal over to international control. An impromptu security council meeting called by Russia to discuss it was abruptly canceled. •  At the heart of the disagreement over the resolution is the question of whether it would be binding, authorizing the use of force in case of noncompliance. US secretary of state John Kerry insisted that it must be. Russian president Vladimir Putin insisted the opposite. • US officials credited the plausible threat of US force with creating new diplomatic breathing room. President Obama was expected to keep up an urgent call for an authorization to use force in Syria . Administration critics said the policy has run willy-nilly. • Syria continued to eagerly demonstrate a willingness to negotiate . Foreign minister Walid al-Moallem said Damascus would declare its chemical weapons assets, agree to their destruction, sign the international chemical weapons convention and promise not to produce more weapons. •  US officials warned against "stalling tactics" to divert US strikes on Syria . US secretary of state John Kerry said the president would decide how long to allow negotiations at the UN to play out. • The Senate has postponed a vote on an authorization to use force. The House has not scheduled a vote. A bipartisan group of senators set to work on a revised authorization to suit the changing diplomatic picture. Obama had lunch with members of the group and others today on Capitol Hill. • Kerry called on the Assad regime to seek a broader peace deal. "I would hope that he and Bashar al-Assad would take this opportunity and try to reach peace... to go further," Kerry said.

As world leaders discussed a Russian proposal to confiscate Syria's chemical weapons and avert U.S. and French action, some of the heaviest fighting was in Barzeh, just north of central Damascus, where residents and opposition activists said air strikes and tank fire supported thrusts by pro-Assad militia. The Syrian state news agency said troops "inflicted casualties on terrorists" in Barzeh and neighbouring Qaboun. "Even if the Russian initiative fails, the regime has at least bought itself time," opposition activist Salah Mohammad said. "It seems to be calculating that no strike is coming soon."

I was just in touch w/Syrian friend in Deir EzZour. Tells me: 'heavy clashes 2day btwn FSA &Jabhat AlNusra in city. Nb of injured not clear'  10.08pm BST  Russian president Vladimir Putin confirmed that he spoke with US president Barack Obama on the sidelines of the G20 summit about a possible plan for Syria to give up its chemical weapons. Reuters has text of the Russian president's remarks: "Russia's position ... is well known - we are against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction of any kind - chemical and nuclear weapons," Putin said. "In the current circumstances in Syria this is really taking on special importance, and the U.S. president and I really did discuss it on the sidelines of the G20 summit." "By the way, this issue has repeatedly been discussed by both experts and politicians - the question of placing Syria's chemical weapons under international control. I repeat, the U.S. president and I discussed this theme on the sidelines of the G20." "We agreed that we would step up this work, intensify it and instruct the (U.S) secretary of state and the Russian foreign minister to ... enter into contact and together try to advance a solution to this question," he said.  10.02pm BST  Syria Deeply flags a series of photos in the Atlantic around the  6 million displaced by war in Syria . Also today on Syria Deeply (whose founder, Lara Setrakian, interviewed US secretary of state John Kerry earlier today) is a Red Cross plea for access to those in need: The Red Cross is pleading for access to the suffering , as they are sometimes blocked by fighting and other times by Syrian government restrictions. “We are not simply getting the permission the way we want it from the authorities to go in,” said Magne Barth, head of the ICRC’s delegation in Syria. “We are unfortunately not able to do as much as we should.” On Monday Syria Deeply ran an Alison Tahmizian Meuse story on displaced Syrians in Lebanon , where one in every four residents is now a refugee: On the side of the highway in Lebanon’s Beqaa Valley, Mohammed, a 14-year-old Syrian boy, sells baby chickens. Dyed neon, they wait in a cage for new owners. They are only 500 Lebanese Lira ($0.33), commonly purchased as gifts for young children. If Mohammed is lucky, they will sell out of chicks by dusk and he will take home half the earnings, roughly $20, to feed his family. “People yell at me from their cars. They curse and make fun of me,” he says. Back in Aleppo he was in school, but now he and his brothers must try and make a living since his father has not been able to find work. Every fourth person in Lebanon is now a Syrian refugee. But its government, fearing a demographic shift, has not allowed for the establishment of designated refugee areas. Instead, Syrians are hidden in crowded apartments in urban centers, scattered along highways and living in sprawling unofficial “camps.” Read the full piece here. Updated at 10.03pm BST  9.42pm BST  Diplomatic sources say it's unlikely there will be any late-night action at the UN security council tonight after Russia's surprise cancellation of the consultations Moscow had itself called, the Guardian's Ed Pilkington ( @EdPilkington ) reports from UN headquarters in New York City. "Nor is there any sign so far of an attempt to reconvene tomorrow," Ed writes: The draft resolution put forward by the US, UK and France is now in the hands of experts from the three countries who are putting the finishing touches to it before it is more widely circulated. Updated at 9.46pm BST  9.41pm BST  The Guardian's Martin Chulov reports from the Aleppo area in northern Syria, where jihadist opposition fighters foresee a US attack – on them: While Syria's mainstream rebels are enthusiastically welcoming talk of an American attack as a chance to break the stalemate, the jihadist groups among them see things through a very different prism, in which my enemy's enemy is not necessarily my friend. All across the north, al-Qaida and its affiliates are on a war footing; a rank and file convinced that an old foe is coming their way and that if and when the US air force does attack, they will have little trouble staying out of its way. "There are many among us [who] fought in Iraq and Afghanistan," said a second jihadist, a 26-year-old softly spoken Saudi, who called himself Abu Abid. "Our emir knows how to deal with them. And all know that while the Americans say they want to attack the regime, we are their real enemy." Abu Abid was speaking inside a roadhouse east of Aleppo, where he and other jihadists whom he says "come from every country you could imagine" gather to eat, and drink tea or coffee. Read the full piece here .  9.24pm BST  There's just one problem with the international plan to secure and dispose of Assad's chemical weapons, military affairs correspondent Yochi Dreazon writes in Foreign Policy: " the plan would be nearly impossible to actually carry out": Experts in chemical weapons disposal point to a host of challenges. Taking control of Assad's enormous stores of the munitions would be difficult to do in the midst of a brutal civil war. Dozens of new facilities for destroying the weapons would have to be built from scratch, and completing the job would potentially take a decade or more. The work itself would need to be done by specially-trained military personnel. Guess which country has most of those troops? If you said the U.S., you'd be right. Read the full piece here . (h/t @ TerryMoran ) Updated at 9.24pm BST  9.07pm BST  Text of Syrian foreign minister Walid al-Moallem's remarks on joining the international chemical weapons convention. "We are ready to declare the location," he says. "We want to join the convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons. We are ready to observe our obligations in accordance with that convention, including providing all information about these weapons," Moualem said in a statement shown on Russian state television. "We are ready to declare the location of the chemical weapons, stop production of the chemical weapons, and show these (production) facilities to representatives of Russia and other United Nations member states," said Moualem. (via Reuters)  9.02pm BST  Kerry is to meet Lavrov in person on Thursday: BREAKING: AP source: Kerry to meet Russian foreign minister in Geneva on Thursday to discuss Syria.  8.53pm BST  The New Yorker's Ryan Lizza is tweeting details of the US-UK-French draft UN resolution, from a "diplomatic source": 1. Condemns 8/21 massacre & specifies it was committed by the Syrian regime. 2. Demands that Assad give up all elements of his chemical weapons program and places them under international control for dismantling. 3. Puts in place an international mechanism for monitoring by Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. 4. Specifies there will be "extremely serious consequences" for noncompliance, meaning the use of force. 4/5 5. Says perpetrators of 8/21 attack will be tried at the International Criminal Court. Lizza says it's a Chapter 7 resolution, with authorization of the use of force in case of noncompliance. "Initial Russian reaction was nyet," Lizza writes, "but that was expected."  8.37pm BST  Syrian prime minister Wael al-Halki said that Damascus had accepted the Russian proposal to turn over its chemical weapons "to spare Syrian blood," state television reported. (Reuters) US secretary of state John Kerry said the United States is waiting to hear suggestions from Russia on how the arsenal turnover would work: "He is sending those to us. They'll be coming informally in the course of the day. We'll have an opportunity to review them," Kerry said in a Google+ hangout interview. Kerry had spoken to Lavrov earlier on Tuesday. (Reuters) Updated at 10.17pm BST  8.08pm BST  It appears that the last-minut e UN security council meeting called by Russia for this afternoon has now been canceled at the last minute. UN meeting now not happening on #Syria . Is this proposal DOA already? Signs of trouble already at UN. Security Council on #Syria that was set for 4pm has been shelved. Russia asked for delay 4pm Security Council meeting not happening. Syria developments like New England weather. Don't like it? Wait a minute.  7.57pm BST  In the Google hangout, Kerry staked out a position on a UN resolution directly opposed to the Russian position as laid out by president Putin, calling for a binding resolution backed up by force. AP's Matt Lee reports: Kerry said Tuesday that Russian suggestions that the U.N. endorsement come in the form of a non-binding statement from the rotating president of the Security Council would be unacceptable to the Obama administration. Kerry said the U.S. has to have "a full resolution from the Security Council in order to have confidence that this has the force that it has to have." He added that the resolution must have "consequences if games are played and somebody tries to undermine this."  7.54pm BST  In addition to promising that Syria would declare its chemical weapons and sign the international convention on them, foreign minister Walid Moallem said Syria would stop making chemical weapons, the AP reports. The extent to which Moallem speaks for Assad is unclear. AP: Walid al-Moallem also says Syria is ready to cooperate fully to implement a Russian proposal to put its chemical weapons arsenal under international control and it will stop producing chemical weapons. He adds that Syria will also place chemical weapons locations in the hands of representatives of Russia, "other countries" and the United Nations. He spoke Tuesday exclusively to the Al-Mayadeen TV station.  7.48pm BST  The Senate suspended plans to vote on military authorisation after meeting with President Obama over lunch on Tuesday to discuss the proposed Russian deal, Guardian Washington bureau chief Dan Roberts reports: Majority leader Harry Reid said: “it's important we do this well, not quickly,” but called on the Syrian government to show that its offer to hand over chemical weapons to international observers was “not a ploy”. Fellow Democrat Joe Manchin, who has opposed military action, said he was heartened by the meeting with the president and said he would pursue a separate resolution giving the Syrians time to comply.  7.45pm BST  Setrakian asks Kerry about the breaking news of Syria's avowed willingness to declare its chemical weapons arsenal and sign the international chemical weapons convention. Kerry calls on Assad to use this moment to enter full peace talks: I know Walid Moallem," Kerry says. "He hosted me... I would hope that he and Bashar al-Assad would take this opportunity and try to reach peace... to go further. To help us in the next days" to figure out how to export and destroy the weapons and to determine how they can make this process work. Kerry concludes: "I hope that perhaps in the next few days they'd be willing to help us try to make those concrete." The hangout has ended.  7.43pm BST  Kerry says the United States probably hasn't done enough to relieve the humanitarian crisis in the region: We probably haven't done enough in some ways, but we're doing as much as we can... the United States, I'm proud to say, is the largest humanitarian donor. Then he turns the crisis into another argument for intervention: Kerry asks: "Simply on a humanitarian basis, how can we as Americans wash our hands and say" we're not going to get involved?  7.39pm BST  More conciliatory noises from the Syrian side: BREAKING: Syrian foreign minister says Syria will declare its chemical weapons arsenal, sign chemical weapons convention.  7.34pm BST  Kerry says the US aid can flow to the moderate opposition without proliferating arms among the extremists: "We've put down a firm barrier between anything that goes to the opposition and those groups," he says. "Their numbers are not as high as some have estimated." Kerry says the characterization of the opposition as radical is wrong and "does a great disservice to General Idris" and his troops in the north, which Kerry numbers at 30-40,000. But "you are correct in saying that they have probably proven themselves to be the best fighters," Kerry says of the al-Qaeda linked extremists. Kerry says regional leaders agree that "if you can hold Syria together" then Syrians are going to expel al-Qaeda.  7.30pm BST  Kerry is asked what the UN can do to build humanitarian aid efforts in Syria: "The UN is absent on this issue regrettably because the Russians and the Chinese have blocked us I think now 11 or 12 times" from establishing access routes to aid civilians in Syria. "We've been blocked by particularly the Russians... and I think every listener, as you think about why this is important, you've really got to ask yourselves, what does it mean that the principle supporters of Assad" are Hezbollah and Iran . Kerry says the US allies, whom he lists, are better than Assad's.  7.24pm BST  Q for Kerry: You have a lot of Americans who don't want a strike on Syria. What's your response? "My response very directly is that this matters to your security. To each of us individually as Americans." Here's what Obama told CNN last night : The notion that Mr Assad could significantly threaten the United States is just not the case.  7.19pm BST  Good conversation in the Google+ hangout (see previous post). Lara Setrakian asks Kerry how long the US is willing to wait for new action on Assad's weapons. "It's up to the president as to how long we wait. The president makes that decision," Kerry says. "We are exchanging some ideas... the president will decide what time frame he can live with." Setrakian asks how this new direction in Syria policy came about. Kerry: We've had conversations about chemical weapons for some period of time... more specifically, we discussed this last week, Sergey Lavrov and I discussed it, President Putin discussed it with President Obama in St. Petersburg, and President Obama instructed him that" he would take it up on the foreign minister level. Kerry concludes: "I obviously mentioned it in public in London on Monday and we are where we are today."  7.15pm BST  US secretary of state John Kerry is participating in a Google+ hangout about Syria with Lara Setrakian of Syria Deeply and New York Times columnist Nick Kristof. Watch here: [the event has ended, see ensuing posts for coverage] Updated at 7.49pm BST  7.13pm BST  Senate majority leader Harry Reid has just spoken following the lunch with Obama, Dan reports. Reid said the Senate still wants to vote on military authorisation but timing will depend on diplomatic developments. Dan writes: Reid says Assad has to show that his openness to turning over chemical weapons is not a ploy. He adds that the US knows exactly where the chemical weapons are. The senator concludes by saying, "it's important we do this well rather than quickly".  7.06pm BST  Guardian Washington bureau chief Dan Roberts catches the president leaving his Capitol Hill luncheon to discuss Syria with a bipartisan group of Senate leaders. The president does not respond to questions shouted by reporters. Updated at 7.07pm BST  6.56pm BST  Here's a summary of where things stand: •  Russian president Vladimir Putin called for a UN resolution to remove chemical weapons from Syria but said one condition would have to be the US rejecting a use of force – a condition the US seemed unlikely to accept. The UN security council announced a meeting Tuesday afternoon to discuss a potential new resolution. •  Before Putin's stipulation, US leaders had greeted the Russian overture with enthusiasm. US secretary of state Kerry said removing Assad's chemical weapons presented an "ideal" path forward. The president called the Russian proposal "potentially positive." •  The need for the credible threat of military force remains, Kerry said. He credited military pressure by the US with having created a new diplomatic possibility . He said he had not misspoken when he said Monday that Assad could avoid strikes by turning over his weapons, although the state department at the time treated the offer as a misstatement, explaining that Kerry was making a "rhetorical argument." •  President Obama was to make a prime-time televised address Tuesday night on Syria. He is expected to argue that military strikes – or the threat of military strikes – still are needed. One question: Does Obama continue to see the Russian proposal as "potentially positive"? Or has Putin already scuttled it? • Obama continued his full-court press to win approval to use force in Syria, inviting congressional leaders to lunch at the White House. But Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell announced his opposition to using force in Syria. •  Syria said it has accepted Russia's proposal. Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem said that his government "agreed to the Russian initiative" as a way of "uprooting US aggression." •  A bipartisan group of senators was working on a new authorization to use force, one day after majority leader Harry Reid announced that a preliminary vote on the original authorization had been postponed. • President Obama spoke Tuesday with prime minister Cameron and president Hollande, and the three countries presented a united front to procure a UN resolution on Syria. • US secretary of defense Chuck Hagel and General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, said strikes on Syria would be an "act of war," notwithstanding Kerry's repeated assurances that the Obama administration is "not asking to go to war."  6.36pm BST  Russia's opposition to an American use of force blankly contradicts a revised Senate resolution being drawn up by a bipartisan group including Democrats Robert Menendez, Carl Levin, Charles Schumer, Chris Coons and Robert Casey, as well as Republicans John McCain, Lindsey Graham, Kelly Ayotte and Saxby Chambliss. The draft legislation proposes that the United Nations pass a resolution saying chemical weapons were used, then the United Nations would remove the weapons from Syria by a set date, Reuters reports: If that did not happen, the use of force would be authorized, according to a source familiar with the negotiations.  6.28pm BST  Reuters has more of Putin's remarks: The proposal "can work only if we hear that the American side and all those who support the United States in this sense reject the use of force," Putin said in televised remarks. He said he hoped the plan "will be a good step toward a peaceful resulution of the crisis".  6.27pm BST  The UN security council will hold a closed-door meeting this afternoon at Russia's request, according to the UN press office.  6.20pm BST  Close Syria watcher Laura Rozen believes that Kerry was not freelancing Monday morning when he said Assad could avoid strikes by turning over control of his chemical weapons. Thought so. So much for accidental plan. Putin said he and Obama had "indeed discussed” such poss. on sidelines G20 http://t.co/5e5mA6sWn3  6.16pm BST  Russian president Vladimir Putin weighs in. Moscow wants a nonbinding resolution, presumably unacceptable to the other side. Where does that leave us? #Putin also says,the chemical weapons handover will only work if US,UK and France renounce use of force. Sets up clash in #UN Sec Council  6.10pm BST  Gavel. Armed services hearing adjourned. McKeon left a few members who'd waited hours to ask their questions hanging out to dry. Apologies all around.  6.04pm BST  The Russian objection to a new UN resolution is cued to any potential use of force, ambassador Alexandre Orlov told French radio TRL, Reuters reports. It appears that Moscow is asking for a nonbinding – and relatively flimsy - resolution. Orlov did say there "needs to be a resolution": "There first needs to be a resolution that puts Syria's chemical weapons under international control, which Syria has already accepted, and if there is something lacking we can come back to the U.N. Security council to negotiate a new resolution," Alexandre Orlov told French radio RTL. Orlov said he had doubts over France's intentions by calling for a Chapter VII resolution of the U.N. charter which could enable the use of force. Updated at 6.06pm BST  5.53pm BST  Hagel appears not to be buying Kerry's declaration that the Obama administration is not asking Congress to go to war. "We can dance around definitions," Hagel says. But "anytime you use military authority or power, that's some aspect of war." Dempsey: "I have said in previous testimony that the strike would be an act of war."

"America's just not buying what you're selling," Palazzo says.  5.33pm BST  Under friendly questioning, US secretary Kerry saya he did not "misspeak" Monday morning when he said Assad may avoid US strikes by giving up his chemical weapons.  5.28pm BST  Following on Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov's expression earlier of a lack of enthusiasm for the new US-UK-France initiative at the United Nations, the Russian ambassador to France says France cannot impose anything on other UN security council members, Reuters reports. The ambassador also said the world needs to make use of a window of opportunity on Syria. So there's that.  5.25pm BST  The Guardian's Spencer Ackerman has the White House passing out rose-colored glasses: Obama team portrays the best-case scenario as likely in each Syria case. No escalation, low retaliation risk, permission to secure chemicals  5.15pm BST  Proposed U.S. strikes on Syria over its alleged use of chemical weapons should not increase refugee flows to neighboring Jordan, which is already under tremendous strain, U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said on Tuesday (via Reuters): "I think it's very unlikely that you would see any increase in refugees because of the nature of the kinds of very precise strikes that we're talking about," Hagel said at a hearing of the House Armed Services Committee  5.10pm BST  President Obama is due to meet for lunchtime talks with Democrat and Republican senators on Capitol Hill after an earlier motion to authorise military force was put on hold by majority leader Harry Reid late on Monday, Guardian Washington bureau chief Dan Roberts (@ RoberstDan ) reports:  5.00pm BST  More on Russia's thinking, as characterized by the French foreign minister (via Reuters): "As I understood, the Russians at this stage were not necessarily enthusiastic, and I'm using euphemism, to put all that into the framework of a U.N. binding resolution," Laurent Fabius told French lawmakers after a telephone conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. There's some debate over whether this Russian lack of enthusiasm constitutes obstructionism: My guess: most of the Russian opposition is around the use of Chap 7 to make it binding, under idea that opens the door to use of force. Brown, a Think Progress writer, adds that "other issues including placing blame for Aug. 21 can also be negotiated down. But no Chapter 7 citation should be a deal-breaker for [US, UK, France]."

" Cameron calls the Russian proposal "serious" but says "a proper timetable" is needed. The Guardian's Andrew Sparrow has Cameron's comments: What's important is to make sure this is not some delaying tactic, that this isn't some ruse. If this is a serious proposal, then we should act accordingly. And a UN security council resolution is a good idea. In that resolution it is quite important that we have some clarity about thresholds. We need to know that there's a proper timetable for doing this. We need to know that there would be a proper process for doing it. And, crucially, there would have to be consequences if it wasn't done. This is a serious proposal. We should treat it accordingly. Of course we should be sceptical. Of course we should not forget a war crime has been committed. But this could be a major step forward. But we need to test it out properly. I think we should also be clear that none of would be happening if there wasn't serious international pressure, led by the United States, on Syria over the issue of chemical weapons ... This is not about someone monitoring chemical weapons in Syria. This has got to be about handing them over to international control and their destruction ... If we can achieve the removal and the destruction of the biggest chemical weapons arsenal in the world, that would be a significant step forward. So it is definitely worth exploring. But we must be sceptical, we must be careful, we must enter this with a very hard head and some pretty cool calculations, because we do not want this to be some delaying tactic, some ruse to just buy time for a regime that must act on chemical weapons. Follow Andrew's live coverage of developments in Britain here .  4.41pm BST  Guardian national security editor Spencer Ackerman is watching the hearing. He catches Hagel leaving the door open on a post-Assad scenario that would require boots on the ground: What abt US troops to secure chemical stocks post-Assad? Hagel: "That's another contingency we've obviously spent a lot of time looking at." Dempsey clarifies that if US troops secure chem stocks "we wouldn't have to fight our way in."

"This is not something that suddenly emerged. Though it did publicly," Kerry said. The alternative explanation: Kerry spoke off the cuff and Russia took him up on it. Updated at 4.34pm BST  4.23pm BST  Kerry describes the Assad chemical arsenal. "They have 1,000 metric tons of chemical agents. ... most of that is in the form of unmixed binary components probably stored in tanks," he says. "They also possess sarin munitions and other things that cannot be accounted for here." He says the weapons have been moved to keep them away from opposition forces: The one benefit of the fact that the regime controls most of these weapons: As the war has progressed... we know they have moved these munitions into a more safely controlled area. This is all regime territory.... The majority if not all of it is in an area controlled by Assad forces.  4.20pm BST  Kerry says president Obama has spoken with the French and English leaders and the three agreed to explore an international disarmament proposal. I've been informed that the president of the United States... has completed a conversation with president Hollande and prime minister Cameron... and they agreed to work closely together in consultation with Russia and China aot explore the viability of the Russian proposal and to put all the Syrian CW" under international control. Kerry says he also spoke with French foreign minister Laurent Fabius this morning.  4.14pm BST  Kerry said president Obama went to the UN for a condemnation on Syria, but it was blocked. There was a resolution that our ambassador to the UN attempted to table. The Russians opposed it and the Chinese opposed it. That's when the president began to look elsewhere.  4.07pm BST  Hagel says it's unsafe for the United States not to strike : I believe as firmly as I am sitting here this morning... that if there is no response ... [Assad] will do it again. We will be back here revisiting these issues... and the next time... it may will be about direct American casualties. And yet there is no safety in action: "There is no operation perfect, I cannot guarantee anything," Hagel says.  3.59pm BST  ABC News reports that centrist Republican senator Rob Portman will join McConnell in opposing the use-of-force authorization.

BREAKING: AP source says Obama agrees to UN discussion on Russia's proposal for Syria's chemical weapons.  3.50pm BST  Here's a summary of the latest developments today: •  France is to test the sincerity of Russia's offer to work with Syria to put its chemical weapons under international control, by seeking a UN resolution on the issue. The resolution, to be tabled later today, will demand that Syria give UN inspectors full access to its stockpiles of chemical weapons. It will also demand those responsible for last month's attack should be held to account through the international criminal court. •  Syria said it has accepted Russia's proposal.  Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem said that his government "agreed to the Russian initiative" as a way of "uprooting US aggression." •  US secretary of state John Kerry has endorsed the idea of turning Syria's chemical stockpiles over to international hands, as "the ultimate way to degrade and deter" the Syrian president's capacity to use the weapons. But he added: "We are not going to fall for stalling tactics." •  Barack Obama plans to press ahead with his attempt to convince Congress of the need for strikes against Syria, despite the potential diplomatic breakthrough . His spokesman said Obama will ask a reluctant Congress to authorise limited strikes on Syria as a way of testing whether Syria is seriously committed to putting its chemical weapons beyond use. New opinion polls show Obama's approval rating on foreign policy has reached a record low. •  Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has become the first congressional leader to oppose punitive action against the Assad regime, as Senators try to amend a congressional resolution authorising military force in Syria. Leading Senate hawk John McCain said the resolution should include a "strict" timeline for Syria to turn over chemical weapons. •  Russia says it is working with Syria on the details of the weapons plan and will then present it to the UN and the body responsible for upholding an international convention banning chemical weapons . A spokesman for Vladimir Putin confirmed that the idea was discussed at last week's G20 summit. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons noted the proposal and reminded Russian and Syrian that the convention has a "zero tolerance" approach. •  Iran and China have expressed backing for the Russian initiative. "The Islamic Republic of Iran favours that initiative and we find this to be within the framework of putting a halt to militarism in the region," foreign ministry spokeswoman Marzieh Afkham told a news conference. •  Syria's main opposition group has dismissed Russia's offer as a delaying tactic. The Syrian National Coalition said the plan would allow crimes of the Assad regime to go unpunished. •  Syrian president Bashar al-Assad has hinted at terrorist reprisals against western interests in the event of a US strike against his country, saying he could not rule out that chemical weapons might be used. In an interview with broadcaster Charlie Rose, Assad insisted there was "not a shred of evidence" that his own government was responsible for the recent chemical attacks inside Syria , but suggested there could be chilling "repercussions" elsewhere in the region if the US intervened. Syria's state news agency has a full transcript of the interview . •  Human Rights Watch has concluded that Syrian government forces were behind last month's poison gas attack in Syria. It said it based the assessment on witness accounts, information on the likely source of the attacks, remnants of the weapons used and medical records of victims. Updated at 3.56pm BST  3.49pm BST  President Obama's effort to win congressional support for strikes on Syria suffered a blow Tuesday when Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, said he would not support the military authorization. From AP and Reuters: McConnell says the proposal is, quote, "utterly detached from a wider strategy to end the civil war" in Syria. "A vital national security risk is clearly not at play," in Syria, McConnell said in a statement that made him the only one of the top four U.S. congressional leaders to oppose the resolution. He said there were "too many unanswered questions" about U.S. strategy in Syria, and the proposed strike may be a "mere demonstration," while a Russian proposal to secure the weapons was worth exploring. Senate leader Harry Reid announced yesterday that a planned vote on the resolution for Wednesday had been postponed. Critics thought it was because he didn't have enough votes to pass it. Kerry has just told the House armed services committee that the Senate chose to hold off "to see whether there are any legs to this Russian proposal." Updated at 3.49pm BST  3.39pm BST  US secretary of state John Kerry delivered a strong endorsement Tuesday of a Russian proposal for Assad to turn his chemical weapons over to international hands, calling the plan " the ultimate way to degrade and deter" the Syrian president's capacity to use the weapons. Kerry told a House committee he had held "several conversations" with the Russian foreign minister about the proposal, which he called "the ideal way to take this weapon away from them." Kerry warned that the United States would not allow debate over the proposal to run long. "[This] cannot be a process of delay," Kerry said: [This] cannot be a process of avoidance. It is exceedingly difficult... to fulfill these obligations. We're waiting for that proposal. But we're not waiting for long. We are not going to fall for stalling tactics. US secretary of defense Chuck Hagel echoed Kerry's skepticism: "All of us are hopeful that this option might present a solution to this crisis," Hagel testified. "Yet we must be clear-eyed and ensure it's not a stalling tactic. Hagel credited a plausible threat of US force with opening a diplomatic opportunity: "The threat of US action must continue. ... The fact that [President Obama] put military action on the table enabled this new diplomatic option to maybe gain credibility." Kerry said the credible threat of US force had already born fruit: "Make no mistake why this idea has any potential legs at all...: a lot of people say that nothing focuses a mind like the prospect of a hanging. Well it's the credible threat of force... that has brought the regime for the first time to even acknowledge they have a chemical arsenal... and to talk about a real ... diplomatic option. Updated at 3.42pm BST  3.27pm BST  US Secretary of State John Kerry is still banging the drum for support for military intervention against the Assad regime in Congress. Appearing before the the Senate's armed services committee Kerry said "What Assad has done directly affects American security." Not acting against Syria would signal US "ambivalence" to Iran, he said. Kerry also insists that diplomacy has been the "first resort" of the Obama administration towards Syria, but diplomatic initiatives have been repeatedly blocked by the Russians. Kerry claims 31 countries have signed up to a "strong response" to Syria's chemical attack. He said diplomatic efforts would be bolstered if the American spoke with "one voice" on Syria.  3.01pm BST  Leading Senate hawk John McCain said is working to amend a congressional resolution authorising military force in Syria to include a "strict" timeline for Syria to turn over chemical weapons. Speaking on CBS' "This Morning" , McCain said he was "extremely sceptical" about the idea that Syria could hand over its weapons, but said "to not pursue this option would be a mistake." Reuters quoted him saying: "Some of us are already working on a modification to a Congressional resolution that would require strict timelines and strict guidelines that would have to be met as part of the authoridation for the president [to use military force]." It added that Democratic Senators Joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp are pushing an alternative that gives the Assad government 45 days to sign an international chemical weapons ban and begin the process of turning over its weapons.  2.55pm BST  Obama's approval ratings continue to tank over his handling of the crisis in Syria. Here's the latest batch of polling: •  Only a third of Americans believe he has handled foreign policy better George Bush , according to a survey by the Reason Foundation. •  The public assessment of Obama's foreign policy has slumped to an all-time low , according to a CNN poll. CNN's polling director Keating Holland said: President Obama's approval rating on foreign affairs has continued its steady decline - from 54% in January to 49% in April, 44% in June, and just 40% now. This may be a troubling sign for a president who in past polls had always scored his highest ratings for his handling of foreign affairs. •  61% of Americans oppose strikes on Syria, while 74% oppose arming the opposition , according to a poll by the New York Times and CBS. Nearly 80% said the administration had not clearly explained its objectives in Syria, while 69% said Obama should not go ahead with a strike without Congressional approval. •  Only a third of people polled by the Wall Street Journal said Congress should approve Obama's request to attack Syria,  and less than a quarter think military action is in the national interest.  2.27pm BST  The Russian proposal on Syria's chemical weapons appears to have opened up divisions in the Arab League. The league general secreatry Nabil Elaraby said he backed the plan and claimed the league has always favoured a "political solution". But the six Gulf states continue to call for action against the Assad regime. Speaking on behalf of the Gulf Cooperation Council, Bahrain's Foreign Minister Sheikh Khaled bin Ahmed al-Khalifa, said: "The GCC condemns the ugly crime committed by the Syrian regime by using internationally banned chemical weapons, which resulted in the killing of hundreds of civilians. "This requires the United Nations and the international community, represented by the security council, to shoulder its responsibility." Reuters also quoted Khalifa calling for "appropriate deterrent measures against those who committed this crime".  2.02pm BST  Obama is still going to press ahead with plans to try to convince Congress of the need for strikes against Syria, despite the potential diplomatic breakthrough over chemical weapons. Speaking to MSNBC White House spokesman Jay Carney said: "What the President said last night reflects where we are this morning: we see this as potentially a positive development and we see this as a clear result of the pressure that has been put on Syria." Carney said Obama will ask a reluctant Congress to authorize limited strikes on Syria as a way of testing whether Syria is seriously committed to putting its chemical weapons beyond use. Obama will address the nation later today, Carney said.  1.31pm BST  Syria said it has accepted Russia's proposal, AP reports. Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem said after meeting with the speaker of Russia's parliament that his government quickly "agreed to the Russian initiative." Moallem added that Syria did so to "uproot US aggression." His statement sounded more definitive than his remarks on Monday, when he said that Damascus welcomed Russia's initiative. Meanwhile Britain has demanded evidence to show that the proposal is not a delaying tactic. Reuters quoted Defence Secretary Philip Hammond as saying: We are in favour of anything that resolves for the longer term the problem of this massive stockpile of chemical weapons the Syrians have got ... History teaches us to be wary of anything which might simply be a delaying tactic. We will need very rapid, very clear evidence that this is a genuine, good-faith proposal and that it can go somewhere, not an alternative to addressing an international community response to the actions which took place on August 21. Angelique Chrisafis and Julian Borger have more on French plans for a UN resolutio n requiring Syria to place its chemical weapons under international control. They say the resolution will include five conditions: Earlier the French embassy in the US cited three conditions . Updated at 3.34pm BST  12.12pm BST  Russia has backed up US claims that Barack Obama and Vladimir Putin discussed the idea of putting Syria's chemical weapons under international control at the G20 summit last week. On Monday the idea appeared to emerge from a slip by US secretary of state John Kerry, which was then seized on by Moscow.  But in TV interviews Obama insisted that he had first raised the idea at the G20 summit as his administration scrambled to claim credit for the Russian deal and insisted Syria was responding to US pressure. "It is unlikely that we would have arrived at that point without a credible military threat," Obama told CNN. Now Obama's version of events has been backed by Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov. "The issue was discussed," Peskov told Reuters. He would not say who raised the issue or give other details.  11.52am BST  Here's a summary of the main developments so far today: •  France is to test the sincerity of Russia's offer to work with Syria to put its chemical weapons under international control, by seeking a UN resolution on the issue. The resolution, to be tabled later today, will demand that Syria give UN inspectors full access to its stockpiles of chemical weapons. •  Russia says it is working with Syria on the details of the weapons plan and will then present it to the UN and the body responsible for upholding an international convention banning chemical weapons . The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons noted the proposal and reminded Russian and Syrian that the convention has a "zero tolerance" approach. •  Iran and China have expressed backing for the Russian initiative. "The Islamic Republic of Iran favours that initiative and we find this to be within the framework of putting a halt to militarism in the region," foreign ministry spokeswoman Marzieh Afkham told a news conference. •  Barack Obama also welcomed Russia's proposal opening up the first real chance of a political settlement to the crisis. Obama described Russia 's offer as a "possible breakthrough" and a "potentially positive development" in the standoff with the regime of Bashar al-Assad as the Senate postponed a crucial vote to authorise military action. •  Syria's main opposition group has dismissed Russia's offer as a delaying tactic. The Syrian National Coalition said the plan would allow crimes of the Assad regime to go unpunished. •  Syrian president Bashar al-Assad has hinted at terrorist reprisals against western interests in the event of a US strike against his country, saying he could not rule out that chemical weapons might be used. In an interview with broadcaster Charlie Rose, Assad insisted there was "not a shred of evidence" that his own government was responsible for the recent chemical attacks inside Syria , but suggested there could be chilling "repercussions" elsewhere in the region if the US intervened.

It said it based the assessment on witness accounts, information on the likely source of the attacks, remnants of the weapons used and medical records of victims.  11.30am BST  Syria's main opposition group has dismissed Russia's offer as a delaying tactic. In a statement the Syrian National Coalition said the proposals does not address "issue[s] of accountability for crimes against innocents". It added: The proposal is a political strategy that aims to stall for more time, which will allow the regime to cause more death and destruction in Syria, and pose a threat to the countries and peoples of the region. The Syrian Coalition emphasises that the violation of international law necessitates a serious and proportionate response. It is not possible under any circumstances to allow war crimes go unpunished. Crimes against humanity cannot be absolved through political concessions, or surrendering the weapons used to commit them. The only guarantee of serious negotiations is establishing the right conditions. This is best achieved by stopping the Assad regime's killing machine and bringing to justice perpetrators of war crimes against the Syrian people. It is vital to remember that the Assad regime, notwithstanding its use of chemical weapons, continues to use all kinds of conventional weapons against innocent women and children. The Assad regime, which has butchered people with knives and burnt them alive, has exhausted all time limits over the past two-and-a-half years. Updated at 11.30am BST  11.25am BST  Fabius said the proposed resolution would be under Chapter 7 of the UN charter covering the possible use of military action to restore peace and would require Damascus to reveal "without delay" the extent of its chemical programme and place it under international control for dismantlement. Reuters quotes the French foreign minister as saying The Russian foreign minister made an offer ... This cannot be used as a manoeuvre to divert us. That is why we have decided to take this initiative. France will put forward a resolution at the UN Security Council in this sense and the procedure starts today. All options remain on the table. Reuters adds: The draft resolution would include an explicit condemnation of 21 August chemical weapons attack on the outskirts of Damascus which the United States says came from Assad's forces and killed more than 1,400 people. It would also contain a call for those behind the attack to be punished at the International Criminal Court. Fabius said he was looking to schedule visits to China later this week and Russia early next week for talks with the two veto-wielding members of the UN Security Council.  11.13am BST  The French foreign ministry says it would accept Russia's offer under three condition : In a statement the French embassy in the US said: "We’re now demanding specific, prompt and verifiable commitments on the part of the Syrian regime." Angelique Chrisafis sees the French move as an attempt to seize back the initiative. By pushing a quick UN resolution on chemical weapons control, Paris seeking to grab back the initiative, take the lead again on #Syria Sweden's Foreign Minister Carl Bildt has backed France's call for a security council resolution. I welcome discussion in UN Security Council on putting Syria CW under international control for destruction. There should be common ground.  11.01am BST  Lavrov said that after Russia and Syria work out the details of their chemical weapons offer they will then be ready to finalize the plan together with UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). The OPCW, director general Ahmet Uzumcu, has "noted" the Russian proposal . He pointed out that the chemical weapons convention was based on "zero tolerance for chemicals", which doesn't leave any room for compromise.  10.47am BST  Securing Syria's chemical weapons could take years , non-proliferation experts warn. Writing in May in the Global and Mail, Cheryl Rofer from the Los Alamos National Laboratory and analyst Aaron Stein, explained the practical steps involved: Syria is believed to have production facilities near Damascus, Aleppo, and Homs, as well as suspected storage sites in Latakia and Palmyra. The military would have to, in the fog of war, move in quickly to secure suspected facilities and find others. During the 2003 invasion of Iraq, for example, the American military did not secure the Tuwaitha nuclear facility after looting started in Baghdad, even though the facility was well known and fears about a potential Iraqi nuclear weapons program were a stated motivation for the war. Once the facilities are found and secured, they must be made safe. Initially, a specialized team would have to check for signs of sabotage, booby traps, deliberately released agents, or other potentially hazardous situations, including war damage. After getting the all-clear, an inspection team would begin the task of accounting for Mr. al-Assad’s chemical stockpile. Internal records and inventory lists would be an essential part of this, but a physical inventory would also be necessary. Current amounts of precursors and agents in storage drums and munitions would be compared with the facility’s inventory lists. If a commander, for example, has failed to keep adequate records, an inspector tasked with producing an inventory of a Syrian chemical weapon facility could never state with 100 per cent confidence that none of the weapons had been stolen or used. The inventory would also serve as basis for planning the destruction of the materials. After the stockpile has been inventoried, the weapons and stocks of agents and precursors would have to be destroyed. The inherent handling difficulties of these materials argue against shipping them to another country for destruction. The closest foreign facilities are in Libya and Russia. The materials would likely have to be airlifted because the most direct overland routes pass through unstable regions in North Africa and the Caucasus. Thus, it is far more likely that the responsible party, which may be a new Syrian government or the United States or the Russian Federation, will opt to destroy the weapons inside Syria. The United States and the Russian Federation have developed a limited number of technologies to destroy chemical weapons. The most difficult part of destroying the weapons is separating the explosives from the highly toxic agents. Although Syrian nerve agents are believed to be stored as precursors, there have been somewhat unreliable reports that the precursors have been mixed and shells filled. Additionally, stocks of vesicants (mustard, lewisite, phosgene) and crowd-control agents are also believed to be part of the arsenal and are probably stored in bulk and in munitions. A stable government that can provide security for the workers is necessary for building the facilities and destroying the chemical agents. The destruction would have to be overseen by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons , the implementing organization for the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). Syria is not now a signatory to the CWC, but the United States and Russia are. The entire process, from building the destruction facilities through their operation and destruction, would take years to complete  10.36am BST  Russia is working on an "effective, concrete" plan for putting Syria's chemical weapons under international control and is discussing the details with Damascus, according to the latest announcement from its foreign minister Sergei Lavrov. Lavrov told reporters the plan would be presented to other nations soon and that the proposal, which he announced on Monday, was not entirely Russian but grew out of contacts with the United States, Reuters reports.  10.34am BST  The Syrian government reckons the Russian initiative has out-maneuvered the US, judging by its pro-government press. Front page of pro #Syria regime paper Al-Watan: #Moscow & #Damascus pull the rug from under feet of #Obama  pic.twitter.com/ToukeH2CKj  10.28am BST  This will test how genuine the Russian offer is: France is to propose a new resolution to the UN's security demanding that Syria open up its chemical weapons stockpiles to UN inspectors. The Guardian's Paris correspondent Angelique Chrisafis is following a press conference by the French foreign minister Laurent Fabius. Fabius: #France will today put resolution to UN Security Council for #Syria to make public & allow inspection of its chemical weapons Fabius said the resolution would set out conditions for Syria to place its chemical weapons under international control and accept that they will be dismantled. French UN resolution also demands that those behind 21 August chemical weapons attack face trial at international criminal court #Syria French UN resolution will state #Syria must reveal & dismantle its chemical weapons programme, face "serious consequences" if it doesn't  9.47am BST  The Russian initiative is only superficially attractive , according to Middle East analyst Juan Cole: Putin’s gambit is irresistible to the West, even if it amounts to nothing. After all, it will take time to amount to nothing, and with the passage of time the urgency of military action (already low) will dissipate irrevocably. The Russian initiative is not attractive because it seems practical or likely to be swiftly implemented but because it allows everyone involved to save face. Obama can look statesmanlike. He is already taking credit for Putin’s move, saying it would not have come about without his own saber-rattling. The US Congress might be able to avoid the uncomfortable position of agreeing that Syria is guilty of chemical weapons use but declining to do anything about it. And, the European Union was desperately looking for some step that could avoid further friction within the deeply divided organization. All this is good news for Western politicians and bad news for the Syrian rebels, who are denouncing the Russian initiative as mendacious. They had hoped that the US would degrade some key regime capabilities, especially the bombing of airports that the regime uses to resupply its troops. Of course, even before the Putin Plan, it was increasingly unlikely that Obama would gain authorization for such a step, in any case. The one good thing about this development is that it strengthens Russia’s position with the Baath government of Bashar al-Assad and may lend new energy to Moscow’s determination to broker a compromise between the rebels and the regime.  9.36am BST  Alexander Kalugin, Russian ambassador to Jordan and a former middle east envoy, has just been on the BBC Today programme, to express his backing for Lavrov's chemical weapons proposals, writes James Meikle. Kulugin noted that he had heard no positive reaction from the opposition in Syria. When John Humphrys pointed out the Syrian regime hadn't even admitted having chemical weapons, Kalugin said: "If they say they are ready, it means they admit ... We know there is a chemical arsenal, that is quite a clear fact." Calling for the "international community" to send in professionals to "secure and verify" , Kalugin admitted such an operation would be difficult but "It is much better to do a difficult job than go ahead with a military option."  9.00am BST  Syria's international allies appearing to be queuing up to get behind Russia's chemical weapons offer. China has become the latest. Reuters quotes foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei welcoming the proposal.  8.43am BST  Welcome to Middle East Live. Does Russia's offer to work with Syria to put its chemical weapons beyond use represent a diplomatic breakthrough or a delaying tactic? Here's a summary of the latest developments: •  Iran, Syria's key regional ally, says it backs Russia's suggestion to put Syria's chemical weapons under international control.  "The Islamic Republic of Iran favours that initiative and we find this to be within the framework of putting a halt to militarism in the region," foreign ministry spokeswoman Marzieh Afkham told a news conference. •  Barack Obama welcomed Russia's proposal opening up the first real chance of a political settlement to the crisis. Obama described Russia 's offer as a "possible breakthrough" and a "potentially positive development" in the standoff with the regime of Bashar al-Assad as the Senate postponed a crucial vote to authorise military action. •  The potential breakthrough appears to have stemmed from a slip by Secretary of State John Kerry underlining how tje Obama administration's handling of Syria has been peppered with gaffes and improvisation, according to Spencer Ackerman and Dan Roberts. With cruise missile strikes against Assad looming, John Kerry, the secretary of state, fielded a question Monday from a reporter in London about avoiding war by saying Assad could "turn over every single bit of his chemical weapons to the international community in the next week." Kerry quickly qualified that Assad "isn't about to do it, and it can't be done." And yet it might be at hand. Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov took the remark approvingly, raising the prospect that one of Syria's major foreign patrons was embracing a way to avoid a war that would implicate its own interests. "We will immediately start working with Damascus," Lavrov said Monday. Suddenly, the Obama administration faced yet another unexpected challenge over Syria: whether it can take yes for an answer, and avoid a war that the Obama administration has never wanted in the first place – but over the last few weeks the White House has felt little choice but to embrace. •  David Cameron responded positively but cautiously to the Syrian-Russian offer saying if it was a genuine it should be regarded as a big step forward. No 10 initially indicated that the proposal was not serious, pointing out that the idea had not been raised during the lengthy discussion on Syria at Friday's G20 dinner in St Petersburg. But in the House of Commons , the prime minister said that it would be "hugely welcome" if the Assad regime were to hand over its chemical weapons stockpile. •  Does Russia have the power to persuade the Assad government to hand over its chemical weapons? asks the Guardian's diplomatic editor Julian Borger. Michael Elleman, senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, told him: My concern is that the Russians don't have that leverage on Assad. The other questions are how long is it going to take, will it involve just the weapons stockpile or the whole production programme, and who would maintain security while this process is under way? •  Syrian president Bashar al-Assad has hinted at terrorist reprisals against western interests in the event of a US strike against his country, saying he could not rule out that chemical weapons might be used. In an interview with broadcaster Charlie Rose, Assad insisted there was "not a shred of evidence" that his own government was responsible for the recent chemical attacks inside Syria , but suggested there could be chilling "repercussions" elsewhere in the region if the US intervened. Syria's state news agency has a full transcript of the interview . •  Human Rights Watch has concluded that Syrian government forces were behind last month's poison gas attack in Syria. It said it based the assessment on witness accounts, information on the likely source of the attacks, remnants of the weapons used and medical records of victims."
"Narendra Modi, in U.N. Speech, Inserts India Into Terrorism Fight","Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India spoke on Saturday at the 69th session of the United Nations General Assembly. Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India reminded the world on Saturday of his countryâs abiding battle against extremist groups, and took a swipe at countries that give them shelter before capping his speech with a call for an International Yoga Day. In his maiden speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Mr. Modi, without naming names, hinted at Indiaâs longstanding contention that its rival, Pakistan, backs groups that have carried out terrorist attacks on Indian soil. Twenty years ago, world leaders used to call it a âlaw and order problem,â he said, suggesting that only now had they had come around to understanding Indiaâs concerns. âSome countries are giving refuge to international terrorists,â he said. âThey consider terrorism to be a tool of their policy.â Mr. Modi signaled his support for the United States’ renewed focus on fighting terrorism , and showed that he clearly understands the value of political symbolism. Even before he arrived at the United Nations, he paid a visit to the National September 11 Memorial and Museum in lower Manhattan. In his meetings at the White House scheduled for Monday and Tuesday, security and counterterrorism cooperation between the two countries is certain to be on the agenda, including a discussion of the American-led airstrikes in Iraq and Syria, administration officials said. Mr. Modi arrived early Saturday for his meeting with the secretary general, Ban Ki-moon. He toured a section of the second floor corridor of the United Nations complex to see several works of art, including an 11th century stone sculpture that  former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi of India presented to the world body in 1982. As expected, he said not a word about a decade-long visa ban by the United States government that had prevented him from coming to the United States since the deadly religious violence in 2002 in the state of Gujarat , which he then led. By ELLEN BARRY Indiaâs new prime minister, Narendra Modi, offers himself as a metaphor for the India he wants to build â ambitious, confident and impatient with slackness of any kind. On climate change, India is under scrutiny for how it will commit to cutting its future emissions. On this issue, Mr. Modi did not show his hand. He spoke about âshouldering our responsibilities,â and reminded rich countries that they have promised to help pay. Earlier this week, his environment minister, Prakash Javdekar, flatly said Indiaâs emissions would necessarily grow through new coal-powered electricity and transportation in the coming years as the country seeks to alleviate poverty and create industry. Mr. Modi offered yoga as one of Indiaâs contributions to global efforts. It is not just exercise, he said.  âBy changing our lifestyle and creating consciousness, it can help us deal with climate change,â he said. âLet us work towards adopting an International Yoga Day.â In his speech, Mr. Modi rebuked India’s neighbor and rival Pakistan, a day after its prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, raised the issue of a referendum for disputed Kashmir province â long a sore spot for India. Mr. Modi said talks with Pakistan were possible in a âpeaceful atmosphere without the shadow of terrorism.â âHowever, Pakistan must also take its responsibility seriously to create an appropriate environment,â he said. âRaising issues in this forum is not the way to make progress towards resolving issues between our two countries.â By THE NEW YORK TIMES Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan spoke at the United Nations on Friday. He began his remarks in an unusually understated way, speaking from prepared notes, which is rare for him, before picking up rhetorical steam and force. He repeatedly invoked Indiaâs Vedic traditions. Mr. Modi spoke in Hindi, as expected, with a generous sprinkling of English words like âprosperity,â âcyber,â and âblue helmets.â India is among the largest contributors of soldiers to United Nations peacekeeping efforts, and Mr. Modi sharply nudged the Security Council to include nations like his when making decisions about what peacekeepers are expected to do.  His comments hinted at the tensions that arise between countries that contribute troops and the world powers on the Security Council that fund them, and set their mandates. Mr. Modi renewed Indiaâs call for a permanent seat on the Security Council, pointedly reminding the audience that the Council’s permanent members â Britain, China, France, Russia, and the United States â represent a bygone era. “Institutions that reflect the imperatives of 20th century won’t be effective in the 21st,” he said. The day before his arrival in New York, a federal court issued a summons for Mr. Modi to respond to a lawsuit that accuses him of human rights abuses in connection with religious riots in 2002 that tore through Gujarat. Mr. Modi, who was the chief minister of the state at the time of the riots, has been accused of acting too slowly to stop the violence. Mr. Modi did not refer to the summons, and it is likely to have no effect. As an administration official pointed out Friday, âas a general legal principle, sitting heads of government enjoy immunity from suits in American courts.â The protection applies to sitting heads of national delegations to the General Assembly, the official added.

"Destructive Creativity","Still thinking my way through the Reinhart-Rogoff debacle and related issues, and I think there’s an important point to be made here about the state of macroeconomics. You can already see quite a few people reacting to this affair by declaring that macro is humbug, we don’t know anything, and we should just ignore economists’ pronouncements. Some of the people saying this are economists themselves! But the truth is that basic macroeconomics — IS-LM type macro , the stuff that’s in Econ 101 textbooks — has performed spectacularly well in the crisis. The true test of an analytical framework is how it performs in unusual or extreme circumstances, how well it predicts “out of sample”. What we have experienced since 2007 is a series of huge policy shocks — and basic macroeconomics made some very counterintuitive predictions about the effects of those shocks. Unprecedented budget deficits, the model said, would not drive up interest rates. A tripling of the monetary base would not cause runaway inflation. Sharp government spending cuts wouldn’t free up resources for the private sector, they would depress the economy more than one-for-one, so that private spending as well as public would fall. Quite a few people considered these predictions not just wrong but absurd; they braced for soaring rates and inflation, they waited for the good news from austerity. But the model passed the test with flying colors. Remember how Romer and Bernstein were savaged for assuming a multiplier of around 1.5? Four years later, after much soul-searching from the IMF about why it underestimated the costs of austerity, estimates seem to be converging on a multiplier of … about 1.5. So how is it that economists look so bad? The answer is that too many prominent economists chose, for one reason or another, to reject the existing model. Maybe they were just trying to score points by being different; maybe they were sucked in by the approbation of the VSPs, the rewards that came from telling important people what they wanted to hear. In any case, we had Alesina/Ardagna saying that austerity is actually expansionary thanks to confidence effects; Reinhart/Rogoff saying that debt has terrible effects on growth via unexplained channels. This stuff was creative, different, deeply appealing to powerful people — and dead wrong. If you stayed with Econ 101, you got it right, if you went with the trendy stuff you made a fool of yourself. The lesson we should have taken from this crisis was that plain ordinary macro is actually a very powerful, very useful tool, one that you ignore at your peril.

"Transcript of the Democratic Presidential Debate in Milwaukee","Advertisement Supported by WOODRUFF: Good evening, and thank you. We are happy to welcome you to Milwaukee for this Democratic debate. WOODRUFF: We are especially pleased to thank our partners at Facebook, who have helped us set up a vibrant conversation among voters who are undecided. And tonight you’re going to hear some of their questions for the candidates. And you can follow along at home on the PBS NewsHour page on Facebook. We also want to thank our hosts, the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, on whose campus we meet, here in the beautiful Helen Bader Concert Hall. IFILL: We want to also extend our warm thanks to Milwaukee Public Radio and Milwaukee Public Television, as well as all of our friends at the PBS member stations across the country tuning in tonight. This is the sixth time the Democrats have met face to face. Each time, we learn more about them and the presidents they say they want to be. You know you’re watching — whether you’re a Democrat, a Republican, or neither — because you believe the outcome of the election is important to you. And we believe that, too. With that, let’s welcome the candidates to the stage. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. (APPLAUSE) WOODRUFF: Welcome, Senator, great to see you. And former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. (APPLAUSE) Very good to be here with you. CLINTON: Thank you. IFILL: Welcome to you both. WOODRUFF: Now, a word about format. There will be two short breaks, and the rules are simple: 90 seconds for each answer and 30 seconds for the other candidate to respond. IFILL: With Iowa and New Hampshire behind us, we are now broadening the conversation to America’s heartland and beyond, including here in Wisconsin. Now let’s turn to the candidates for their opening statements. The order was decided by coin toss. And, Senator Sanders, you go first. SANDERS: Well, Gwen and Judy, thank you very much for hosting this event. And, PBS, thank you. Nine months ago, our campaign began. And when it began, we had no political organization, no money, and not much name recognition outside of the state of Vermont. A lot has happened in nine months. And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice. SANDERS: And aligned with a corrupt campaign finance system is a rigged economy. And that’s an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers. They are worried to death about the future of their kids. And yet they are seeing almost all new income and all new wealth going to the top 1 percent. And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system. They see more people in jail in the United States of America than any other country on earth, 2.2 million. We’re spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans. They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all. No criminal records for them. I think what our campaign is indicating is that the American people are tired of establishment politics, tired of establishment economics. They want a political revolution in which millions of Americans stand up, come together, not let the Trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a government that represents all of us, not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors. Thank you. IFILL: Thank you, Senator Sanders. (APPLAUSE) IFILL: Thank you, Senator Sanders. Secretary Clinton. CLINTON: I’m running for president to knock down all the barriers that are holding Americans back, and to rebuild the ladders of opportunity that will give every American a chance to advance, especially those who have been left out and left behind. I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy. And for good cause. Americans haven’t had a raise in 15 years. There aren’t enough good-paying jobs, especially for young people. And yes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top. We both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again. But I want to go further. I want to tackle those barriers that stand in the way of too many Americans right now. African-Americans who face discrimination in the job market, education, housing, and the criminal justice system. Hardworking immigrant families living in fear, who should be brought out of the shadows so they and their children can have a better future. Guaranteeing that women’s work finally gets the pay, the equal pay that we deserve. I think America can only live up to its potential when we make sure that every American has a chance to live up to his or her potential. That will be my mission as president. And I think together we will make progress. WOODRUFF: Thank you both. (APPLAUSE) WOODRUFF: Thank you both. And we’ll be right back after a short break to begin questions.(COMMERCIAL BREAK) WOODRUFF: And, welcome back to this PBS Newshour debate, Democratic debate, here in Milwaukee. Let’s get right to the questions. Senator Sanders, to you first. Coming off the results in Iowa and New Hampshire, there are many voters who are taking a closer look at you, and your ideas, and they’re asking how big a role do you foresee for the federal government? It’s already spending 21% of the entire U.S. economy. How much larger would government be in the lives of Americans under a Sanders presidency? SANDERS: Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled. In other words, the very rich are getting richer, almost everybody is going — getting poorer. What I believe is the United States, in fact, should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people. Our Medicare for all single-payer proposal will save the average middle class family $5,000 a year. I do believe that in the year 2016 we have to look in terms of public education as colleges as part of public education making public colleges and universities tuition free. I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind. Our waste water plants, our rail, our airports, in many places are disintegrating. Yeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars. WOODRUFF: But, my question is how big would government be? Would there be any limit on the size of the role of government... SANDERS: ... Of course there will be a limit, but when today you have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, when the middle class is disappearing, you have the highest rate of child poverty of almost any major country on Earth. Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living. CLINTON: Judy, I think that the best analysis that I’ve seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans — let’s take healthcare for example. Last week in a CNN town hall, the Senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare. Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don’t add up, and that’s a promise that cannot be kept, and it’s really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math. This is about people’s lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare. SANDERS: Well, let us level with the American people. Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, people are going to lose their MedicAid, they’re going to lose their CHIP program. I have fought my entire life to make sure that healthcare is a right for all people. We’re not going to dismantle everything. But, here is the truth. Twenty-nine million people have no health insurance today in America. We pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. One out of five Americans can’t even afford the prescriptions their doctors are writing. Millions of people have high deductibles and co-payments. What I said, and let me repeat it, I don’t know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to, but what I have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle — the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars. In my view healthcare is a right of all people, not a privilege, and I will fight for that.(APPLAUSE) CLINTON: I can only say that we both share the goal of universal health care coverage. You know, before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare. And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage. (APPLAUSE) And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama’s principal accomplishment — namely the Affordable Care Act — is because I know how hard it was to get that done. We are at 90 percent coverage. We have to get the remaining 10. I’ve set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs. And it is difficult to in any way argue with the goal that we both share. But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work. If it’s Medicare for all, then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable Care Act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system. The Children’s Health Insurance Program, which I helped to create, which covers 8 million kids, is also a different kind of program. So if you’re having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing. And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don’t add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now. IFILL: Final thought, Senator. SANDERS: That is absolutely inaccurate. Look, here is the reality, folks. There is one major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people. There is one major country — the United States — which ends up spending almost three times per capita what they do in the U.K. guaranteeing health care to all people, 50 percent more than they do in France guaranteeing health care to all people, far more than our Canadian neighbors, who guarantee health care to all people. Please do not tell me that in this country, if — and here’s the if — we have the courage to take on the drug companies, and have the courage to take on the insurance companies, and the medical equipment suppliers, if we do that, yes, we can guarantee health care to all people in a much more cost effective way. CLINTON: Well, let me just — let me just say, once again... (APPLAUSE) ... that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care. I believe we are on the path to doing that. The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again. And we are not England. We are not France. We inherited a system that was set up during World War II; 170 million Americans get health insurance right now through their employers. So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage. We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100. I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent. (APPLAUSE) IFILL: I’d like to move along. I’d like to move along. Secretary Clinton, you might — you also have proposed fairly expansive ideas about government. You may remember this pledge from a State of the Union Address at which I believe you were present, in which these words were said: “The era of big government is over.” You may remember that. When asked your feelings about the federal government this week, 61 percent of New Hampshire Democrats told exit pollsters that they are angry or at least dissatisfied. Given what you and Senator Sanders are proposing, an expanding government in almost every area of our lives, is it fair for Americans who fear government to fear you? CLINTON: No. But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family? In my case, whether it’s health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward. I’ve tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning. There is a great deal of skepticism about the federal government. I’m aware of that. It comes from the right, from the left, from people on all sides of the political spectrum. CLINTON: So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can’t keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people’s lives. IFILL: But I haven’t heard either of you put a price tag on your — you say... (CROSSTALK) CLINTON: I will put a price tag. My price tag is about $100 billion a year. And again, paid for. And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt. I believe I can get the money that I need by taxing the wealthy, by closing loopholes, the things that we are way overdue for doing. And I think once I’m in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that. But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost. IFILL: Senator? SANDERS: Well, Secretary Clinton, you’re not in the White House yet. And let us be clear that every proposal that I have introduced has been paid for. For example, all right, who in America denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling? Roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, who denies that? Who denies that real unemployment today, including those who have given up looking for work and are working part-time is close to 10 percent? Who denies that African-American youth unemployment, real, is over 50 percent. We need to create jobs. So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax. Yes, I’m going to do away with that. We will use those proceeds, a hundred billion a year, to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure. Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession — Great Depression. Yes, I do believe that now after the American people bailed Wall Street out, yes, they should pay a Wall Street speculation tax so that we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free. We bailed them out. Now it is their time to help the middle class. (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: You know, I think, again, both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young Americans. And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition. We differ, however, on a couple of key points. One of them being that if you don’t have some agreement within the system from states and from families and from students, it’s hard to get to where we need to go. And Senator Sanders’s plan really rests on making sure that governors like Scott Walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free. I am a little skeptical about your governor actually caring enough about higher education to make any kind of commitment like that. (APPLAUSE) WOODRUFF: Next, we’re going to... SANDERS: A brief response. WOODRUFF: Very brief, thank you. SANDERS: Here is where we are with public education. A 100, 150 years ago incredibly brave Americans said, you know what, working class kids, low income kids should not have to work in factories or on the farms. Like rich kids, they deserve to get a free education. And that free education of extraordinary accomplishment was from first grade to 12th grade. The world has changed. This is 2016. In many ways, a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50, 60 years ago. So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities. That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families. (APPLAUSE) WOODRUFF: Secretary Clinton, your campaign — you and your campaign have made a clear appeal to women voters. You have talked repeatedly about the fact, we know you would be, if elected, the first woman president. But in New Hampshire 55 percent of the women voters supported and voted for Senator Sanders. What are women missing about you? CLINTON: Well, first, Judy, I have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices, even if that choice is not to vote for me. I believe that it’s most important that we unleash the full potential of women and girls in our society. And I feel very strongly that I have an agenda, I have a record that really does respond to a lot of the specific needs that the women in our country face. So I’m going to keep making that case. I’m going to keep making sure that everything I’ve done, everything that I stand for is going to be well known. But I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support. I just hope that by the end of this campaign there will be a lot more supporting me. That’s what I’m working towards. (APPLAUSE) WOODRUFF: As you know, just quickly, as you know, your strong supporter, former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, said the other day that there’s a special place in Hell for women who don’t support other women. Do you agree with what she said? CLINTON: Well, look, I think that she’s been saying that for as long as I’ve known her, which is about 25 years. But it doesn’t change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make. That’s what I’ve always stood for. And when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether we’re going to have equal pay, paid family leave, some opportunity for, you know, women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them, I think that we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why that’s at the core of my campaign. I would note, just for a historic aside, somebody told me earlier today we’ve had like 200 presidential primary debates, and this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage. So, you know, we’ll take our progress wherever we can find it. (APPLAUSE) WOODRUFF: Senator Sanders, you’re in the minority, but we still want to hear from you. (LAUGHTER) SANDERS: Look, we are fighting for every vote that we can get from women, from men, straight, gay, African-Americans, Latinos, Asian- Americans. We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class. I am very proud, if my memory is not correct — I think I am — that I have a lifetime — and I’ve been in Congress a few years — a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record. I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women. I’m very proud that I support legislation that is currently in the Congress, got support of almost all progressive Democrats in the House and Senate, which says we will end the absurdity of women today making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men. And we will join the rest of the other — the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families. (APPLAUSE) IFILL: Senator, do you worry at all that you will be the instrument of thwarting history, as Senator Clinton keeps claiming, that she might be the first woman president? SANDERS: Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well. (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: You know, I have said — I have said many times, you know, I’m not asking people to support me because I’m a woman. I’m asking people to support me because I think I’m the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander- in-chief. (APPLAUSE) And I appreciate greatly Senator Sanders’ voting record. And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I’ve been a leader on these issues. I have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep women’s health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves. CLINTON: I’m very proud that NARAL endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on women’s issues. Somebody who, yes, votes right, but much more than that, leads the efforts to protect the hard-fought gains that women have made, that, make no mistake about it, are under tremendous attack, not just by the Republican presidential candidates but by a whole national effort to try to set back women’s rights. So I’m asking women, I’m asking men, to support me because I’m ready to go into the White House on January 20th, 2017 and get to work on both domestic and foreign policy challenges. (APPLAUSE) WOODRUFF: Final comment. SANDERS: Let me concur with the secretary, no question women’s rights are under fierce attack all over this country. And I will tell you something that really galls me. I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy. Just a little bit. All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government. Government is the enemy. We’re going to cut Social Security to help you. We’re going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible. But, by the way, when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice, ah, in that case, my Republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in America. If that’s not hypocrisy, I don’t know what hypocrisy is. (APPLAUSE) IFILL: Thank you both. IFILL: We turn now to the first of several questions from our partners at Facebook. They were selected from a curated group of people we’ve been following of undecided voters. The first comes from Claudia Looze, a 54-year-old woman who works as a program manager at a public affairs cable network in Madison, Wisconsin. And she writes: “Wisconsin is number one in African-American male incarceration, according to a University of Wisconsin study. They found that Wisconsin’s incarceration rate for black men, which is at 13 percent, was nearly double the country’s rate. What can we do across the nation to address this?” Senator Sanders. SANDERS: This is one of the great tragedies in our country today. And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug. It has to be dealt with. Today a male African-American baby born today stands a one-in-four chance of ending up in jail. That is beyond unspeakable. So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system. (APPLAUSE) SANDERS: What we have to do is end over-policing in African- American neighborhoods. The reality is that both the African-American community and the white community do marijuana at about equal rates. The reality is four times as many blacks get arrested for marijuana. Truth is that far more blacks get stopped for traffic violations. The truth is that sentencing for blacks is higher than for whites. We need fundamental police reform, clearly, clearly, when we talk about a criminal justice system. I would hope that we could all agree that we are sick and tired of seeing videos on television of unarmed people, often African-Americans, shot by police officers. What we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable. (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: You know, I completely agree with Senator Sanders. The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration. The statistics from Wisconsin are particularly troubling, because it is the highest rate of incarceration for African-Americans in our nation, twice the national average. And we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us. His family certainly believes that. And so do I. So we have work to do. There have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen. President Obama’s policing commission came out with some. I have fully endorsed those. CLINTON: But we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect. And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that’s one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn’t happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level. But, I would also add this. There are other racial discrepancies. Really systemic racism in this state, as in others, education, in employment, in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people, particularly young men, are pushed out of school early, are denied employment opportunities. So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities. (APPLAUSE) SANDERS: Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with. This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea. It takes away discretion from judges. We have got to demilitarize local police departments so they do not look like occupying armies. (APPLAUSE) We have got to make sure that local police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity. And, where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see. People are being released from jail without the education, without the job training, without the resources that they need to get their lives together, then they end up — we’re shocked that they end up back in jail again. So, we have a lot of work to do. But, here is a pledge I’ve made throughout this campaign, and it’s really not a very radical pledge. When we have more people in jail, disproportionately African American and Latino, than China does, a communist authoritarian society four times our size. Here’s my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country. We will invest in education, and jobs for our kids, not incarceration and more jails. (APPLAUSE) WOODRUFF: Secretary Clinton, I was talking recently with a 23 year old black woman who voted for President Obama because she said she thought relations between the races would get better under his leadership, and his example. Hardly anyone believes that they have. Why do you think race relations would be better under a Clinton presidency? What would you do that the nation’s first African American has not been able to? CLINTON: Well, I’m just not sure I agree completely with that assessment. I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did. We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone. So, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society. I think President Obama has set a great example. I think he has addressed a lot of these issues that have been quite difficult, but he has gone forward. Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next. We now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system. We now have some good models about how better to provide employment, housing and education. I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the President’s office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obama’s work with young women. But, we can’t rest. We have work to do, and we now know a lot more than we ever did before. So, it’s going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open. Nobody can deny them. To use the Justice Department, as we just saw, they have said they are going to sue Ferguson, that entered into a consent agreement, and then tried to back out. So, we’re going to enforce the law, we’re going to change policing practices, we’re going to change incarceration practices, but we’re also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.(APPLAUSE) WOODRUFF: Senator Sanders? (APPLAUSE) SANDERS: Well, I think, Judy, what has to be appreciated is that, as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on Wall Street, millions of lives were hurt. People lost their jobs, their homes, their life savings. Turns out that the African- American community and the Latino community were hit especially hard. As I understand it, the African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse. So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration — which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother — clearly, we are looking at institutional racism. We are looking at an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. And sadly, in America today, in our economy, a whole lot of those poor people are African-American. WOODRUFF: So race relation was be better under a Sanders presidency than they’ve been? SANDERS: Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they’re not hanging out on street corners. We’re going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education. And I think when you give low-income kids — African-American, white, Latino kids — the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail. They’re going to end up in the productive economy, which is where we want them. (APPLAUSE) IFILL: Let me turn this on its head, because when we talk about race in this country, we always talk about African-Americans, people of color. I want to talk about white people, OK? SANDERS: White people? IFILL: I know. (LAUGHTER) So many people will be surprised to find out that we are sitting in one of the most racially polarized metropolitan areas in the country. By the middle of this century, the nation is going to be majority nonwhite. Our public schools are already there. If working- class, white Americans are about to be outnumbered, are already underemployed in many cases, and one study found they are dying sooner, don’t they have a reason to be resentful, Senator — Secretary Clinton? CLINTON: Look, I am deeply concerned about what’s happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths. People with a high school education or less are not even living as long as their parents lived. This is a remarkable and horrifying fact. And that’s why I’ve come forward with, for example, a plan to revitalize coal country, the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy, by the reduction in the use of coal. You know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us? Do people not care about all of our sacrifice? And I’m going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country. I particularly appreciate the proposal that Congressman Jim Clyburn has — the 10-20-30 proposal — to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty. And you know what? If you look at the numbers, there are actually as many, if not more white communities that are truly being left behind and left out. So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans — particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have — you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is. And that’s why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that. (APPLAUSE) IFILL: Senator — Senator, I want you to respond to that, but I also want you to — am I wrong? Is it even right to be describing this as a matter of race? SANDERS: Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well. So, yes, we can talk about it as a racial issue. But it is a general economic issue. SANDERS: And here’s what the economic issue is. The wages that high school graduates receive today are significantly less, whether you are white or black, than they used to be. Why is that? Because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate America through NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, Secretary Clinton and I disagree on those issues. But view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street. Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world. But you know what, you can make a middle class wage, you have decent health care, decent benefits. You once had a pension. Those jobs, in many cases, are now gone. They’re off to China. Now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone. What have you got now? You are working at McDonald’s? That is why there is massive despair all over this country. People have worked their entire lives. They’re making a half, two-thirds what they used to make. Their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all. And that’s why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down. Suicide, alcoholism, drugs, that’s why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power. (APPLAUSE) WOODRUFF: Thank you. Senator Sanders, one of the causes of anxiety for working class Americans is connected to immigrants. President Obama, as you know, has issued executive actions to permit some 5 million undocumented immigrants who are living now in the United States to come out of the shadows without fear of deportation to get work permits. Would you go further than that? And if so, how specifically would you do it? Should an undocumented family watching this debate tonight, say, in Nevada, rest easy, not fear of further deportations under a Sanders presidency? SANDERS: The answer is yes. We’ve got 11 million undocumented people in this country. I have talked to some of the young kids with tears rolling down their cheeks, are scared to death that today they may or their parents may be deported. I believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something that I strongly supported. I believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship. I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act. And in fact I would go further. What would motivate me and what would be the guiding light for me in terms of immigration reform, Judy, is to bring families together, not divide them up. And let me say this also. Somebody who is very fond of the president, agrees with him most of the time, I disagree with his recent deportation policies. And I would not support those. Bottom line is a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people, if Congress doesn’t do the right thing, we use the executive orders of the president. (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: I strongly support the president’s executive actions. I hope the Supreme Court upholds them. I think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did. I am against the raids. I’m against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up. We should be deporting criminals, not hardworking immigrant families who do the very best they can and often are keeping economies going in many places in our country. I’m a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform. Have been ever since I was in the Senate. I was one of the original sponsors of the DREAM Act. I voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2007. Senator Sanders voted against it at that time. Because I think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship. And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade. Hopefully after the 2016 election, some of the Republicans will come to their senses and realize we are not going to deport 11 or 12 million people in this country. And they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform.(APPLAUSE) SANDERS: Secretary Clinton, I do have a disagreement here. If my memory is correct, I think when we saw children coming from these horrendous, horrendously violent areas of Honduras and neighboring countries, people who are fleeing drug violence and cartel violence, I thought it was a good idea to allow those children to stay in this country. That was not, as I understand it, the secretary’s position. In terms of 2007 immigration reform, yeah, I did vote against it. I voted against it because the Southern Poverty Law Center, among other groups, said that the guest-worker programs that were embedded in this agreement were akin to slavery. Akin to slavery, where people came into this country to do guest work were abused, were exploited, and if they stood up for their rights, they’d be thrown out of this country. So it wasn’t just me who opposed it. It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country. It was the AFL-CIO. It was some of the most progressive members of the United States Congress who opposed it for that reason. But we are where we are right now. And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up. What we have to do right now is bring our people together and understand that we must provide a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people. CLINTON: Two quick responses. One, with respect to the Central American children, I made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately, but we also had to send a message to families and communities in Central America not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers. I’ve also called for the end of family detention, for the end of privately-run detention centers, along with private prisons, which I think are really against the common good and the rule of law. And with respect to the 2007 bill, this was Ted Kennedy’s bill. And I think Ted Kennedy had a very clear idea about what needed to be done. And I was proud to stand with him and support it. (APPLAUSE) WOODRUFF: I’d like... SANDERS: Well, let me just respond. I worked with Ted Kennedy. He was the chairman of my committee. And I loved Ted Kennedy. But on this issue, when you have one of the large Latino organizations in America saying vote no, and you have the AFL-CIO saying vote no, and you have leading progressive Democrats, in fact, voting no, I don’t apologize for that vote. But in terms of the children, I don’t know to whom you’re sending a message. Who are you sending a message to? These are children who are leaving countries and neighborhoods where their lives are at stake. That was the fact. I don’t think we use them to send a message. I think we welcome them into this country and do the best we can to help them get their lives together. (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: Well, that just wasn’t — that just wasn’t the fact, Senator. The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border. So we have a disagreement on this. I think now what I’ve called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made. (APPLAUSE) IFILL: If you would allow me now to move on, we’ve been talking about children. I want to talk about seniors. That takes us to our second Facebook question from Farheen Hakeem, who writes, “My father” — she’s a 40-year-old woman who works for a nonprofit here in Milwaukee. And she writes, “My father gets just $16 in food assistance per month as part of Medicaid’s family community program in Milwaukee County for low-income seniors. How will you as president work to ensure low-income seniors get their basic needs met?” Start with you, Senator Sanders. SANDERS: OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation. And by those standards, we’re not doing particularly well. SANDERS: We have the highest rate of childhood poverty among almost any major country on Earth. And in terms of seniors, there are millions of seniors — and I’ve talked to them in my state of Vermont and all over this country — who are trying to get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year Social Security. And you know what? You do the arithmetic. You can’t get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year. And here’s an area where Secretary Clinton and I believe we have a difference. I have long supported the proposition that we should lift the cap on taxable income coming into the Social Security Trust Fund, starting at $250,000. (APPLAUSE) And when we — and when we do that, we don’t do what the Republicans want, which is to cut Social Security. We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years. Yes, the wealthiest people, the top 1.5 percent, will pay more in taxes. But a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half, where they don’t have decent nutrition, where they can’t heat their homes in the wintertime. That is not what America should be about. If elected president, I will do everything I can to expand Social Security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well. (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: I think — I think it’s fair to say we don’t have a disagreement. We both believe there has to be more money going into the Social Security system. I’ve said I’m looking at a couple of different ways, one which you mentioned, Senator, but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the Social Security Trust Fund. I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially. First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs. I want to take care of women. When the Social Security program was started in the 1930s, not very many women worked. And women have been disadvantaged ever since. They do not get any credit for their care-taking responsibilities. And the people who are often the most hard-hit are widows, because when their spouse dies, they can lose up to one-half of their Social Security monthly payment. So we have no disagreement about the need to buttress Social Security, get more revenue into the program. But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don’t believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them. SANDERS: In all due respect... (APPLAUSE) SANDERS: In all due respect, Secretary Clinton, a lot of the progressive groups, the online groups have really asked you a simple question. Are you coming onboard a proposal? And what is that proposal? Now, the proposal that I have outlined, you know, should be familiar to you, because it is what essentially Barack Obama campaigned on in 2008. You opposed him then. I would hope that you would come onboard and say that this is the simple and straightforward thing to do. We’re asking the top 1.5 percent, including passive income, to start paying a little bit more so that the elderly and disabled vets in this country can live with security and dignity. I hope you will make a decision soon on this. CLINTON: Well, Senator, look, I think we’re in vigorous agreement here. We both want to get more revenue in. I have yet to see a proposal that you’re describing that the — raising the cap would apply to passive income. That has not been... SANDERS: That’s my bill. Check it out. CLINTON: Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I’ve seen. I’m interested in making sure we get the maximum amount of revenue from those who can well afford to provide it. So I’m going to come up with the best way forward. We’re going to end up in the same place. We’re going to get more revenue. I’m going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first. (APPLAUSE) WOODRUFF: We’re going to move on. Secretary Clinton, your campaign has recently ramped up criticism of Senator Sanders for attending Democratic Party fundraisers from which you say he benefited. But nearly half of your financial sector donations appear to come from just two wealthy financiers, George Soros and Donald Sussman, for a total of about $10 million. WOODRUFF: You have said that there’s no quid pro quo involved. Is that also true of the donations that wealthy Republicans give to Republican candidates, contributors including the Koch Brothers? CLINTON: I can’t speak for the Koch Brothers, you’re referring to a Super PAC that we don’t coordinate with, that was set up to support President Obama, that has now decided that they want to support me. They are the ones who should respond to any questions. Let’s talk about our campaigns. I’m very proud of the fact that we have more than 750 thousand donors, and the vast majority of them are giving small contributions. So, I’m proud of Senator Sanders, and his supporters. I think it’s great that Senator Sanders, President Obama and I have more donors than any three people who have every run, certainly on the Democratic side. That’s the way it should be, and I’m going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is. I think that is the real key here. We both have a lot of small donors. I think that sets us apart from a lot of what’s happening right now on the Republican side. The Koch Brothers have a very clear political agenda. It is an agenda, in my view, that would do great harm to our country. We’re going to fight it as hard as we can, and we’re going to fight whoever the Republicans nominate who will depend on the Koch Brothers, and others. (APPLAUSE) WOODRUFF: I’m asking if Democratic donors are different than Republican donors. SANDERS: What we are talking about in reality is a corrupt campaign finance system, that’s what we’re talking about. We have to be honest about it. It is undermining American democracy. When extraordinarily wealthy people make very large contributions to Super PACs, and in many cases in this campaign, Super PACs have raised more money than individual candidates have, OK? We had a decision to make early on, do we do a Super PAC? And, we said no. We don’t represent Wall Street, we don’t represent the billionaire class, so it ends up I’m the only candidate up here of the many candidates who has no Super PAC. But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something. And, it turns out that up until — and this has blown me away, never in a million years would I have believed that I would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people. Now, Secretary Clinton’s Super PAC, as I understand it, received $25 million dollars last reporting period, $15 million dollars from Wall Street. Our average contribution is $27 dollars, I’m very proud of that. (APPLAUSE) IFILL: Senator Sanders, are you saying... CLINTON: We are mixing apples and oranges. My 750,000 donors have contributed more than a million and a half donations. I’m very proud. That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country. But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me. It’s not my PAC. If you take donations from Wall Street, you can’t be independent. I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever. Now, when it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street. He pushed through, and he passed the Dodd-Frank regulation, the toughest regulations since the 1930’s. So, let’s not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it’s Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what’s best for the American people.(APPLAUSE) SANDERS: The people aren’t dumb. Why in God’s name does Wall Street... (APPLAUSE) But let’s not — but let’s not — let’s not insult — let’s not insult the intelligence of the American people. People aren’t dumb. Why in God’s name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions? I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around. (LAUGHTER) Why does the pharmaceutical industry make huge campaign contributions? Any connection maybe to the fact that our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs? Why does the fossil fuel industry pay — spend huge amounts of money on campaign contributions? Any connection to the fact that not one Republican candidate for president thinks and agrees with the scientific community that climate change is real and that we have got to transform our energy system? (APPLAUSE) And when we talk about Wall Street, let’s talk about Wall Street. I voted for Dodd- Frank, got an important amendment in it. In my view, it doesn’t go anywhere near far enough. But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash. No Wall Street executive has been prosecuted. (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: Well, let’s just — let’s just follow up on this, because, you know, I’ve made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk. I think that’s a major accomplishment. I agree, however, it doesn’t go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason. I go further in the plan that I’ve proposed, which has been called the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan for reining in the other risks that the financial system could face. It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers, that contributed to our collapse. It was a big insurance company, AIG. It was Countrywide Mortgage. My plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be. And I believe that not only Barney Frank, Paul Krugman, and others, have said that what I have proposed is the most effective. It goes in the right direction. We have Dodd-Frank. We can use it to break up the banks, if that’s appropriate. But let’s not kid ourselves. As we speak, there are new problems on the horizon. I want to get ahead of those, and that’s why I’ve proposed a much more comprehensive approach to deal with all of these... (CROSSTALK) (APPLAUSE) WOODRUFF: We have to go to a break. We... SANDERS: Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here. When you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of America, while issuing two-thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages, look, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, that great trust-buster would have said break them up. I think he would have been right. I think he would have said bring back a 21st-century Glass-Steagall legislation. I think that would have been right, as well. That’s my view. (APPLAUSE) WOODRUFF: All right. Thank you both. It is time for a break. And when we come back, we’re going to turn to some new topics, including how these candidates will keep America safe. IFILL: There’s a lot more to come in just a few minutes. Stay with us for more of the PBS NewsHour Democratic Debate.(BREAK) WOODRUFF: Welcome back to the Democratic presidential debate. Before we return to our questions, we have a follow-up question from our Facebook group. And it is to Senator Sanders. Senator, it comes from Bill Corfield. He is a 55-year-old musician from Troy, Ohio. And he asks: “Are there any areas of government you would like to reduce?” SANDERS: Hey, I’m in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesn’t think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken. I believe in government, but I believe in efficient government, not wasteful government. IFILL: How about you, Senator Clinton — Secretary Clinton? CLINTON: Absolutely. And, you know, there are a number of programs that I think are duplicative and redundant and not producing the results that people deserve. There are a lot of training programs and education programs that I think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful, in public schools, community colleges, and colleges and universities. I would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we’re taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we don’t need anymore. And that’s what I intend to do. SANDERS: If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited. And I have the feeling you’re going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities. (APPLAUSE) IFILL: We spent the first part of this debate talking about domestic insecurity. The second part, we want to talk about our foreign policy insecurities. And we want to start with a question for you, Secretary Clinton, about America’s role in the world. Americans are becoming increasingly worried that attacks abroad are coming home, that they already are, in fact, here. According to exit polls from last week, from earlier this week, more than two- thirds of Democrats in New Hampshire are concerned about sending their children to fight in wars they can’t win. They fret that the next attack is just around the corner and we are not ready. Are we? CLINTON: Look, I think we are readier than we used to be, but it’s a constant effort that has to be undertaken to make sure we are as ready as we need to be. We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven’t done enough. So we have to go after this both abroad and at home. We have to go after terrorist networks, predominantly ISIS — that’s not the only one, but let’s focus on that for a minute. We have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from ISIS. That is principally an American-led air campaign that we are now engaged in. We have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the Arabs and the Kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from Raqqa to Ramadi. We have to continue to work with the Iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside Iraq, like Mosul, when they are able to do so. And we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters. And we have to take on ISIS online. They are a sophisticated purveyor of propaganda, a celebrator of violence, an instigator of attacks using their online presence. Here at home, we’ve got to do a better job coordinating between federal, state, and local law enforcement. We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it’s needed. But the final thing I want to say about this is the following. You know, after 9/11, one of the efforts that we did in New York was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it. And we need to do that throughout the country. But we need to understand that American Muslims are on the front line of our defense. They are more likely to know what’s happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society. So when somebody like Donald Trump and others... (APPLAUSE) ... stirs up the demagoguery against American Muslims, that hurts us at home. It’s not only offensive; it’s dangerous. And the same goes for overseas, where we have to put together a coalition of Muslim nations. I know how to do that. I put together the coalition that imposed the sanctions on Iran that got us to the negotiating table to put a lid on their nuclear weapons program. (APPLAUSE) And you don’t go tell Muslim nations you want them to be part of a coalition when you have a leading candidate for president of the United States who insults their religion. So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle. IFILL: Senator Sanders... SANDERS: Let me just say this. What a president of the United States has got to do — and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility — is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe, that we work with allies around the world to protect... ... president of the United States has got to do, and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility, is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe. That we work with allies around the world to protect democratic values. That we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity. I voted against the war in Iraq because I listened very carefully to what President Bush and Vice President Cheney had to say and I didn’t believe them. And if you go to my Web site,berniesanders.com, what you find is not only going to help lead the opposition to that war, but much of what I feared would happen when I spoke on the floor of the House, in fact, did happen in terms of the instability that occurred. Now I think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where Secretary Clinton and I disagree is the area of regime change. Look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the United States, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world. And God only knows Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator. We could overthrow Assad tomorrow if we wanted to. We got rid of Gadhafi. But the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it’s to understand what happens the day after. And in Libya, for example, the United States, Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named Gadhafi. But what happened is a political vacuum developed. ISIS came in, and now occupies significant territory in Libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold. But this is nothing new. This has gone on 50 or 60 years where the United States has been involved in overthrowing governments. Mossadegh back in 1953. Nobody knows who Mossadegh was, democratically-elected prime minister of Iran. He was overthrown by British and American interests because he threatened oil interests of the British. And as a result of that, the shah of Iran came in, terrible dictator. The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today. Unintended consequences. So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences. I will do everything I can to make certain that the United States and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the Middle East. (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: If I could just respond. Two points. One, Senator Sanders voted in 1998 on what I think is fair to call a regime change resolution with respect to Iraq, calling for the end of Saddam Hussein’s regime. He voted in favor of regime change with Libya, voted in favor of the Security Council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do, which of course we followed through on. I do not believe a vote in 2002 is a plan to defeat ISIS in 2016. It’s very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in. When people go to vote in primaries or caucuses, they are voting not only for the president, they are voting for the commander-in- chief. And it’s important that people really look hard at what the threats and dangers we face are, and who is best prepared for dealing with them. As we all remember, Senator Obama, when he ran against me, was against the war in Iraq. And yet when he won, he turned to me, trusting my judgment, my experience, to become secretary of state. I was very honored to be asked to do that and very honored to serve with him those first four years. (APPLAUSE) SANDERS: Judy, if I can, there is no question, Secretary Clinton and I are friends, and I have a lot of respect for her, that she has enormous experience in foreign affairs. Secretary of state for four years. You’ve got a bit of experience, I would imagine. But judgment matters as well. Judgment matters as well. And she and I looked at the same evidence coming from the Bush administration regarding Iraq. I lead the opposition against it. She voted for it. But more importantly, in terms of this Libya resolution that you have noted before, this was a virtually unanimous consent. Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that. SANDERS: That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support. CLINTON: You did support a U.N. Security Council approach, which we did follow up on. And, look, I think it’s important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the Obama administration was, and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin Laden. I looked at the evidence. I looked at the intelligence. I got the briefings. I recommended that the president go forward. It was a hard choice. Not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that. And at the end of the day, it was the president’s decision. So he had to leave the Situation Room after hearing from the small group advising him and he had to make that decision. I’m proud that I gave him that advice. And I’m very grateful to the brave Navy SEALs who carried out that mission. (APPLAUSE) SANDERS: Judy, one area very briefly... WOODRUFF: Just a final word. SANDERS: Where the secretary and I have a very profound difference, in the last debate — and I believe in her book — very good book, by the way — in her book and in this last debate, she talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of Henry Kissinger. Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country. (APPLAUSE) I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend. I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger. And in fact, Kissinger’s actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world. So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger. (APPLAUSE) IFILL: Secretary Clinton? CLINTON: Well, I know journalists have asked who you do listen to on foreign policy, and we have yet to know who that is. SANDERS: Well, it ain’t Henry Kissinger. That’s for sure. CLINTON: That’s fine. That’s fine. (LAUGHTER) You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas. I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America. (APPLAUSE) So if we want to pick and choose — and I certainly do — people I listen to, people I don’t listen to, people I listen to for certain areas, then I think we have to be fair and look at the entire world, because it’s a big, complicated world out there. SANDERS: It is. CLINTON: And, yes, people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight, may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the United States. (APPLAUSE) SANDERS: I find — I mean, it’s just a very different, you know, historical perspective here. Kissinger was one of those people during the Vietnam era who talked about the domino theory. Not everybody remembers that. You do. I do. The domino theory, you know, if Vietnam goes, China, da, da, da, da, da, da, da. That’s what he talked about, the great threat of China. And then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, you’re right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China. The terrible, authoritarian, Communist dictatorship he warned us about, now he’s urging companies to shut down and move to China. Not my kind of guy. (APPLAUSE) WOODRUFF: Senator, let me — let me move on to another country with which the U.S. has a complicated relationship, Senator Sanders, and that’s Russia. On the one hand, we’re aware that Russia is a country that the United States needs to cooperate with. WOODRUFF: Just tonight, Secretary of State John Kerry has announced what appears to be an agreement with the Russians to lead — that could lead toward a ceasefire in Syria, would be the first cessation of conflict in that country, in that civil war in five years, but it comes at a very high price, because not only have all — have we seen the deaths, the removal of so many people, millions of people, we now see the Russians in the last few weeks have bombed in a way that benefits President Assad, has not gone after ISIS. So my question to you is, when it comes to dealing with Russia, are you prepared — how hard are you prepared to be? Are you prepared to institute further economic sanctions? Would you be prepared to move militarily if Russia moves on Eastern Europe? It seems to me that Russia recently has gotten the better of the United States. SANDERS: Well, this is what I would say. It is a complicated relationship. I congratulate Secretary of State John Kerry and the president for working on this agreement. As you’ve indicated, what is happening in Syria, the number of people, the hundreds of thousands of people who have been killed — men, women, 20,000 children, the people who are forced to flee their own country — their own country - - it is unspeakable. It is a real horror. Now, what I think is that right now we have got to do our best in developing positive relations with Russia. But let’s be clear: Russia’s aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO — correctly, I believe — are saying, you know what, we’re going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action. I happen to believe that Putin is doing what he is doing because his economy is increasingly in shambles and he’s trying to rally his people in support of him. But bottom line is: The president is right. We have to put more money. We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression. SANDERS: Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made. The agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout Syria. The agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the Russians agreed to. You know, the Russians wanted to buy time. Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what’s left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire? So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease- fire up as quickly as possible. But I would add this. You know, the Security Council finally got around to adopting a resolution. At the core of that resolution is an agreement I negotiated in June of 2012 in Geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in Syria together. This is incredibly complicated, because we’ve got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia. We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view. This is one of the areas I’ve disagreed with Senator Sanders on, who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria, which I think would be a grave mistake. Putting Iranian troops right on the border of the Golan right next to Israel would be a nonstarter for me. Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter. So let’s support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let’s hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what’s left of the opposition. And remember, the Russians have not gone after ISIS or any of the other terrorist groups. So as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like. So we’ve got some real work to do, and let’s try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians. (APPLAUSE) SANDERS: Let me just — just say this. For a start, the secretary and I disagree — and I think the president does not agree with her — in terms of the concept of a no-fly zone in Syria. I think you do have a humanitarian tragedy there, as I mentioned a moment ago. I applaud Secretary Kerry and the president for trying to put together this agreement. Let’s hope that it holds. SANDERS: But furthermore, what we have got to do, I’m sorry, yes, I do believe that we have got to do everything that we can, and it will not happen tomorrow. But I do hope that in years to come, just as occurred with Cuba, 10, 20 years ago, people would say, reach normalized relations with Cuba. And by the way, I hope we can end the trade embargo with Cuba as well. But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve. And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations. That’s how you make peace in the world. You sit down and you work with people, you make demands of people, in this case demanding Iran stop the support of international terrorism. (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: Well, I respectfully disagree. I think we have achieved a great deal with the Iranian nuclear agreement to put a lid on the Iranian nuclear weapons program. That has to be enforced absolutely with consequences for Iran at the slightest deviation from their requirements under the agreement. I do not think we should promise or even look toward normalizing relations because we have a lot of other business to get done with Iran. Yes, they have to stop being the main state sponsor of terrorism. Yes, they have to stop trying to destabilize the Middle East, causing even more chaos. Yes, they’ve got to get out of Syria. They’ve got to quit sponsoring Hezbollah and Hamas. They have got to quit trying to ship rockets into Gaza that can be used against Israel. We have a lot of work to do with Iran before we ever say that they could move toward normalized relations with us. (APPLAUSE) SANDERS: We have a lot of work to do. We have a lot of work to do. But I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against then-Senator Obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran, that you want to talk to our enemies. I have no illusion. Of course you are right. Iran is sponsoring terrorism in many parts of the world, destabilizing areas. Everybody knows that. But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality. (CROSSTALK) CLINTON: ... Senator Sanders, from a debate in 2008, quote what I said. The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions? I said no. And in fact, in Obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions. That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking. (APPLAUSE) SANDERS: No, I think the idea was that president — then-Senator Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents. It’s easier to talk to your friends. It’s harder to talk to your enemies. I think we should do both. (APPLAUSE) IFILL: Let me move on. You have both mentioned the humanitarian tragedies which have been an outgrowth in part of what has happened in Syria and in Libya. More than a million refugees entered Europe in 2015. Another 76,000 just last month, that is about 2,000 arrivals every day. Nearly 400 people have been lost at sea so far this year, crossing the Mediterranean. And there are reports that 10,000 children are missing. If we are leaders in this world, where should the U.S. be on this? What should the United States be doing, Secretary Clinton? CLINTON: Well, I was pleased that NATO announced just this week that they’re going to start doing patrols in the Mediterranean, in the Aegean, to try to interdict the smugglers, to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often, also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the European Union. And it’s especially significant that they are working with both Turkey and Greece in order to do this. With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part. And we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to Turkey and to members of the E.U. in particular. CLINTON: This is a humanitarian catastrophe. There is no other description of it. So we do as the United States have to support our friends, our allies in Europe. We have to stand with them. We have to provide financial support to them. We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on. And we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves. SANDERS: A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation. And I went to one of these Turkish refugee camps right on the border of Syria. And what a sad sight that was: Men, women, children forced out of their homes. And Turkey, by the way, did a very decent thing, providing what was reasonable housing and conditions for those people. It seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed, for the downtrodden, that I very strongly disagree with those Republican candidates who say, you know what, we’ve got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing, nothing at all. That is not what America is supposed to be about. So I believe that working with Europe — and, by the way, you know, we’ve got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world. You got Kuwait and you got Qatar and you got Saudi Arabia. They have a responsibility, as well. But I think this is a worldwide — that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we’re seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well. (APPLAUSE) WOODRUFF: And we have a final question from our Facebook family. And it goes to Senator Sanders. It comes from Robert Andrews. He’s a 40-year-old stay-at-home dad in Dover, Massachusetts. He says, “The world has seen many great leaders in the course of human history. Can you name two leaders — one American and one foreign — who would influence your foreign policy decisions? And why do you see them as — why are they influential?” SANDERS: You know, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the American people were unemployed, country was in incredible despair. And he stood before the American people and he said, “The only thing we have to fear is fear itself,” a profound statement that gave the American people the courage to believe that, yes, we could get out of that terrible depression. And then what he did is redefine the role of government. You know, you had Herbert Hoover before that saying, no, we got to only worry about the deficit. So what if mass unemployment exists? So what if children are going hungry? That’s not the role of the government. And when FDR said, “Yeah, it is,” that we’re going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs, to build homes, to feed people, to protect the farmers, we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish. And kind of — that’s what I see our campaign is about right now. In this particular moment of serious crises, saying to the American people don’t give up on the political process. don’t listen to the Trumps of the world and allowing them to divide us. If we reengage and get involved, yeah, we can have health care for all people, we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free. We do not have to have massive levels of income and wealth inequality. In the same light, as the foreign leader, Winston Churchill’s politics were not my politics. He was kind of a conservative guy in many respects. But nobody can deny that as a wartime leader, he rallied the British people when they stood virtually alone against the Nazi juggernaut and rallied them and eventually won an extraordinary victory. Those are two leaders that I admire very much. (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said. And I agree about the role that he played both in war and in peace on the economy and defeating fascism around the world. I would choose Nelson Mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation. CLINTON: But I want to — I want to follow up on something having to do with leadership, because, you know, today Senator Sanders said that President Obama failed the presidential leadership test. And this is not the first time that he has criticized President Obama. In the past he has called him weak. He has called him a disappointment. He wrote a forward for a book that basically argued voters should have buyers’ remorse when it comes to President Obama’s leadership and legacy. And I just couldn’t agree — disagree more with those kinds of comments. You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don’t think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president... (APPLAUSE) The New York Times will be checking assertions made throughout the 2016 presidential campaign. CLINTON: ... who got us out of that... (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: ... put us on firm ground, and has sent us into the future. And it is a — the kind of criticism that we’ve heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans. I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama. SANDERS: That is... (APPLAUSE) SANDERS: Madam Secretary, that is a low blow. I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years. When President Obama came into office we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, 800,000 jobs a month. We had a $1.4 trillion deficit. And the world’s financial system is on the verge of collapse. As a result of his efforts and the efforts of Joe Biden against unprecedented, I was there in the Senate, unprecedented Republican obstructionism, we have made enormous progress. (APPLAUSE) SANDERS: But you know what? Last I heard we lived in a democratic society. Last I heard, a United States senator had the right to disagree with the president, including a president who has done such an extraordinary job. So I have voiced criticisms. You’re right. Maybe you haven’t. I have. But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said? The blurb said that the next president of the United States has got to be aggressive in bringing people into the political process. That’s what I said. That is what I believe. (APPLAUSE) SANDERS: President Obama and I are friends. As you know, he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator. I have worked for his re- election. His first election and his re-election. But I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president. I have been a strong ally with him on virtually every issue. Do senators have the right to disagree with the president? Have you ever disagreed with a president? I suspect you may have. (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don’t agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re- election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements. As a senator, yes, I was a senator. I understand we can disagree on the path forward. But those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that I find particularly troubling. IFILL: Senator, if you would like respond to — you may respond to that but it is time for closing statements and you can use your time for closing statements to do that. SANDERS: Well, one of us ran against Barack Obama. I was not that candidate. (APPLAUSE) SANDERS: All right, look, this has been a great debate. A lot of interesting issues have come together. Let me conclude by just saying this. There is no president, in my view, not Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, who has the capability or the power to take on Wall Street, large campaign donors, the corporate media, the big money interests in this country alone. This campaign is not just about electing a president. What this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of Americans, working people who have given up on the political process, they don’t think anybody hears their pains or their concerns. Young people for whom getting involved in politics is as, you know, it’s like going to the moon. It ain’t going to happen. Low income people who are not involved in the political process. SANDERS: What this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda, it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent, who today have so much economic and political power. Thank you all very much. (APPLAUSE) WOODRUFF: Secretary Clinton? CLINTON: You know, we — we agree that we’ve got to get unaccountable money out of politics. We agree that Wall Street should never be allowed to wreck Main Street again. But here’s the point I want to make tonight. I am not a single- issue candidate, and I do not believe we live in a single-issue country. I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it’s poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it’s the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that’s what I want to take on. And here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: We’ve got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before... (APPLAUSE) ... the American middle class, and who are being attacked by ideologues, by demagogues. Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence? You’re right. But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint. We would still have racism holding people back. We would still have sexism preventing women from getting equal pay. We would still have LGBT people who get married on Saturday and get fired on Monday. And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions. So I’m going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don’t think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs. (APPLAUSE) IFILL: Thank you. Thank you Senator Clinton. Thank you, Senator Sanders. We also want to thank our partners at Facebook and our hosts here at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee. (APPLAUSE) WOODRUFF: And we want to thank our audience, our quiet audience here in Helen Bader Concert Hall, and to all of you watching at home. Thank you all. Stay tuned for analysis of the debate and the overall race for the Democratic nomination. That’s coming up next here on PBS stations and online atPBS.org/NewsHour. IFILL: I’m going to remain here in Milwaukee tomorrow evening for a special edition of Washington Week here on PBS. WOODRUFF: And I’m going to be returning to Washington. I hope you’ll join us for the PBS NewsHour tomorrow and every night. That’s it from all of us here in Milwaukee. We thank you. IFILL: Good night. (APPLAUSE) Advertisement"
"Want to Be Happy? Join a Union","Fewer and fewer Americans belong to a union. Membership is down to a historic low of 11.2 percent of the work force, and only 6.7 percent of workers in the private sector. And if the nationâs confidence in the institution is anyÂ measure, not many people are mourning itsÂ diminishment. According to a Gallup poll , organized labor inspires less confidence than banks. But a recent study Â may give some workers reason toÂ reconsider. For those who belong to a union, membership seems to bring a benefit that perhaps surpasses better wages or generous health insurance: higher life satisfaction. The study authors, Patrick Flavin, an assistant professor at Baylor University, and Gregory Shufeldt, an assistant professor at the University of Arkansas, Little Rock, used data from five different years between the early 1980s and mid-2000s, conducted in the United States, of the World Values Survey, a research project focusing on peopleâs beliefs. As they write in the report, they found that âunion members are more satisfied with their lives than those who are not members and that the substantive effect of union membership on life satisfaction is large and rivals other common predictors of quality of life.â Today, many say unions have more problems than a lack of members. âWhat Unions No Longer Do,â by Jake Rosenfeld, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Washington, lays out other aspects of their decline. Justin Fox at the Harvard Business Review offers a summary : Unions do not equalize incomes; counteract racial inequality; play a big role in assimilating immigrants; or give lower-income Americans a political voice. Yet as Mr. Flavin and Mr. Shufeldt told Op-Talk in an email: âLabor union membership still has benefits, and that this is true for all union members. Simply put, if one goal of labor unions is to boost the quality of life for their members, our study provides empirical evidence that they are succeeding.â In their study, they tease out four âpathwaysâ by which being a union member might improve quality of life compared with not being a member: âThese include having greater satisfaction with oneâs experiences while working, feeling greater job security, being afforded numerous opportunities for social interaction and integration, and enhancing the participatory benefits associated with more engaged democratic citizenship.â Mr. Flavin and Mr. Shufeldt acknowledged in their email that despite these qualities, public confidence in organized labor is low â and, they note, âhas been relatively constant for the past 20 years or so.â âAs Americans, we now are less likely to live in a union household or know someone that belongs to a union than in the past,â they say. âMost of the widely known achievements of the American labor movement occurred nearly 100 years ago. We take many of these gains for granted, such as the 40 hour workweek, child protection laws, the right to collectively bargain, etc.â In their study, they note that union membership appears to have an effect independent of factors like income. âWe statistically control for a series of demographic factors to isolate the relationship between union membership and subjective well-being and ensure that union members arenât happier simply because they have higher incomes, etc.,â Mr. Flavin and Mr. Shufeldt told Op-Talk. âWhen we account for that series of possible confounding factorsâ â these include income, education, gender, age, marital status, self-reported health, employment status and church attendance â âwe find that labor union members are more satisfied with their lives than non-members.â The effect, moreover, is powerful. The study notes that union membership offers a bigger boost in satisfaction than an increase in income, for example (but, to be sure, less than getting married). âWe believe the substantive effect of being a union member on subjective well-being is important and relatively large when compared to other typical predictors,â the authors told Op-Talk. Yet some suggest, like Daniel DiSalvo at The Daily Beast , that âpublic employee unions drive up government costs and depress productivity, weakening the stateâs capacity to assist the poor and middle class.â Mr. Flavin and Mr. Shufeldt disagree with this view. They told Op-Talk, âBased on previous research with other colleagues, weâve found that states/countries with higher union membership levels also have higher levels of subjective well-being. In addition, states/countries with more active labor unions tend to have a stronger social safety net (welfare generosity, unemployment insurance, etc.), which previous research links to higher levels of subjective well-being among citizens.â Nevertheless, in recent decades, unions have faced determined, even existential opposition to their very existence, as the authors note in the study: âAccording to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (2014), only 11.3 percent of all wage and salary workers are members of a labor union, which reflects a decline of almost 10 percent of the American working population in the last 30 years,â they write. âMoreover, as evidenced by the quick demise of the Employee Free Choice Act in Congress and more recent high profile battles over collective bargaining rights and employee benefits in several states, even the ability to organize and join a labor union has become a politically contentious issue.â Still, Mr. Flavin and Mr. Shufeldt told Op-Talk, âPolicy decisions, unfortunately, are rarely made based on how it might affect subject well-being.â But, they add, in this study and in previous research, âwe have found a clear positive relationship between more generous social welfare policies, size of government, union membership, and citizensâ subjective well-being. So we believe labor unions still have an important role to play in promoting quality of life among citizens.â Finally, they told Op-Talk: âIf our paper could give any advice to labor unions, it is hopefully that we can give new meaning to the adage, âdonât mourn, organize.ââ Op-Talk is your guide to today's debates and the variety of voices behind them.

"Tackling underfunding in children’s mental health services","The government has promised a national network of crisis and home-treatment teams to cope with increasing demand for services  Tue 17 May 2016 12.00 BST   Last modified on Wed 20 Sep 2017 19.25 BST   A sk anyone involved with children’s mental health services what the biggest problem facing them is, and they will say one of two things: funding and demand. “There is a historic legacy of underfunding and neglect,” says Liberal Democrat peer Lady Claire Tyler, chair of the recent commission set up to look at how to improve mental health services for children and young people. There is also an unprecedented level of need: Wales alone witnessed a 100% increase in demand for child and adolescent mental health services between 2010 and 2014. But the previous coalition and current Conservative governments have put a focus on improving services. In the March 2015 budget, just before the general election, the government promised an extra £250m a year for five years to mental health services for young people, pregnant women and new mothers. In February, the government endorsed the key targets for children and young people’s services proposed by the independent Mental Health Taskforce . These include a maximum two-week referral for a child or adolescent following their first psychotic episode, and the development of a national network of crisis and home-treatment teams which will offer young people intensive support at home rather than in hospital. It is hoped that these moves will help support at least 70,000 more young people a year with mental health issues by 2020-21. “They’re bold ambitions,” says Prof Dame Sue Bailey, chair of the charities organisation Children and Young People’s Mental Health Coalition (CYPMHC). “Whether they can be achieved immediately everywhere … I think you have to put a dose of reality into this.” So, what can be done to achieve them? A commission chaired by Lady Tyler and sponsored by the Royal College of Psychiatrists, the charity Young Minds and the CYPMHC, was launched in January to look at what can be done to improve services for this young group. One concern is whether the funding promised by the government will reach the frontline. “Is that money going to come through at the pace we were promised and is needed to turn services around?” Lady Tyler asks. Former care minister Norman Lamb points out the money is not ringfenced. “I’m quite sure that in many areas it won’t all be spent as it should be on mental health,” he says. Dr Peter Hindley, chair of the faculty of child and adolescent psychiatry at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, echoes Lamb’s concerns, despite a Department of Health confirmation that the extra £1.4bn will come through in the next five years. “It’s really important that there’s good oversight and that we make sure that the funding goes to where it’s meant to go,” he says. The government’s two-week deadline for psychosis referral is based on the value of early intervention. “There’s very good evidence that if you intervene early and prevent deterioration of the condition, you can lead to very important gains long-term,” Hindley says. Integration between different services is vital to its success, but rigid structures in statutory services can lead to confusion among young people. Lack of joint working between education and health is another key issue. “Without schools and mental health services working more closely together, and without good early intervention, we will never address young people’s mental health,” says Sarah Brennan, chief executive of Young Minds . Bailey argues that a culture shift is needed: “Services have not been set up to work together, and just telling us to work together won’t hack it. There’s got to be a shift in the way we think, a balance between having a national framework and trying local innovation.” Ultimately, the question is whether the current focus on mental health will result in changes on the ground to services for children and young people. “We’ve got a real opportunity, a consensus about what needs to change,” says Brennan. “It’s whether everything keeps moving in the same direction, or whether the good intentions are undermined by confusion, lack of action, loss of faith, or money dribbling away in different directions.” For Tania Stanway, a consultant clinical psychologist, young people having a say in the services they use “seems like a no-brainer”. She is a clinical director at the Cheshire and Wirral Partnership NHS foundation trust, which provides specialist child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) and has been recognised for its work involving young people in designing services. The government’s children and young people’s mental health taskforce was clear in its 2015 report, Future in Mind, that it is vital for services to include young people in decision-making. One way Cheshire and Wirral has done this is through its My Mind website. Designed by young people, it includes information about what CAMHS is, resources for self-help and sections for parents and carers. “What’s been interesting about the site is the way it shifted the culture of participation in our service,” says Fiona Pender, clinical director of Wirral CAMHS, in that it showed people in the trust and outside how young people with mental health difficulties can get involved. “If we designed services that fitted our needs in terms of funding and structures, they may not be the right services for young people.” Cheshire and Wirral was also the first NHS trust to adopt the young advisers scheme, which trains young people to influence local decision-making. There is now a group of 12 young advisers at the trust who have all used services, and sit on recruitment panels, attend committees and give advice. Across England, CAMHS are struggling with dramatic increases in demand: between 2013-14 and 2014-15, referral rates increased five times faster than the workforce, according to the report by the independent Mental Health Taskforce in February. “We can’t afford to take all the kids who need help anymore, we’ve got to work together,” says Pender. A big part of this is joint working with schools. At Cheshire and Wirral, CAMHS is working with six schools in a pilot project to improve resilience and knowledge of mental health issues among students. By doing this, any issues young people are having can hopefully be identified earlier, and so they are less likely to need specialist statutory help to resolve them. “There are loads of people who work with children and want to help them, but are often afraid of what to do around mental health,” Pender says. “So what we’re doing as experts in CAMHS is sharing our understanding and skills with them.”"
"On Not Being Stupid","John Cochrane has a remarkably reasonable post walking back some of his earlier diatribes, and I was particularly pleased to see him acknowledge that Mike Woodford’s work on monetary policy is first-rate research by a first-rate researcher. May I suggest, then, that he also read Woodford on fiscal policy (pdf)? Woodford’s paper is from 2010, but the basic framework he uses was familiar to everyone on my side of the debate — me, Christy Romer, Brad DeLong, Alan Blinder — long before; you can see me using essentially the same kind of approach to talk through some stimulus issues here . Some of us like to step back and forth between intertemporal models like Woodford’s and ad hoc models like IS-LM, but we’ve always made the effort to see whether a policy makes sense both ways. So it came as something of a revelation back in 2009 when Cochrane declared that the case for fiscal policy was a fairy tale nobody believed, Lucas accused Christy Romer of producing a shlock model to justify big government, etc.. It revealed that these people had stopped listening years, indeed decades ago. And it has been remarkable in the years since to see how determined the anti-Keynesians are to keep believing that Keynesians are stupid. Well, at least Cochrane now concedes that Woodford isn’t stupid. Progress! Paul Krugman is an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times. Advertisement"
"What’s the connection between your weight and your personality?","Interestingly, personality traits may have some bearing on your physique  Sun 3 Jul 2016 05.59 BST   Last modified on Wed 14 Feb 2018 21.20 GMT   A recent US study found that people who score high for extroversion rate themselves as leaner and taller than they actually are, with male extroverts weighing more than introverts. Conscientiousness is associated with a healthier weight, with the most conscientious (in the top 25%) weighing on average almost 5kg less than the least conscientious (in the bottom 25%). Participants scoring low on emotional stability tended to overestimate their weight, although women who gave themselves a low score did actually weigh more than others with higher scores on this trait. These findings held across all of the ethnic groups included in the study. While some links are unsurprising (eg conscientious people stick to their diets), some are not so easy to explain. Why, for example, do extroverted men weigh more? Is it because they’re always in the pub? If so, perhaps the “beer goggle” effect explains why they rate themselves as taller and thinner than they actually are. A fully referenced version of this article is available at benambridge.com .

"The Burden of Nuclear Waste","Advertisement By BEHNAM TAEBI AUG. 29, 2010  DELFT, THE NETHERLANDS — Tensions within Chancellor Angela Merkel’s administration over Germany’s energy policy cut to the heart of a contentious, worldwide debate over the future of nuclear power. The old controversies over nuclear reactors — their dangers, benefits and costs — have been raised to the forefront. But as politicians, energy experts and the general public weigh the pros and cons, one key element in harnessing energy from the atom is being neglected: the link between the different methods of producing nuclear power and the nature — and longevity — of the radioactive waste that each method leaves behind. This in turn raises the issue of intergenerational justice: The technical choices we make today will determine the extent of the burden humanity will face in containing contaminated byproducts that can remain radioactive for tens of thousands of years. While an increasing number of states are being swayed by the fact that nuclear power can enhance domestic energy security, produce large amounts of energy, and emit very low greenhouse gas byproducts, critics nonetheless remain vociferous. They cite the continued risk of reactor accidents, the dangers of transporting nuclear fuel and fears of proliferation — along with the vexing problem of how to deal with the long-lived nuclear waste — as  reasons why it should be curtailed. Advertisement But what is most striking in this controversy is the “missing nuclear debate.” Little is said about the major distinctions between the various production methods, or nuclear fuel cycles. Rather than reducing nuclear power to a simple yes/no, good/bad dichotomy, we need to focus first on the  advantages and disadvantages of each nuclear energy production method, including the burdens and benefits they pose now and in generations to come. Advertisement One of the key differentiating features between the various production methods is the nature of waste that is produced after irradiating fuel (uranium oxide) in a reactor. In the so-called open fuel cycle (common in the United States, Sweden and some other countries) spent fuel is generally disposed of as waste that will remain radioactive for 200,000 years. In the alternative, known as the closed fuel cycle, or European method, spent fuel is reprocessed in order to extract the redeployable uranium and plutonium, which are then re-entered into the fuel cycle. In the closed fuel cycle, the lifetime of radioactive waste is reduced to about 10,000 years. Approached from the framework of intergenerational justice, there is a strong case for arguing that the people living today should deal with the burdens of nuclear power because we will enjoy the lion’s share of its benefits. Thus, from a moral point of view, if we want to keep developing and spreading nuclear power, the closed fuel cycle should  be preferred because it reduces the radioactive lifetime of waste and the burdens placed on future generations. However, the closed cycle brings about another  intergenerational dilemma:  In order to reduce long-term concerns for future generations, we will create short-term safety, security and economic burdens for people currently alive.

Nuclear reprocessing itself is a complex and costly chemical process. More importantly, the plutonium separated during reprocessing in the closed cycle method raises the risk of proliferation of nuclear weapons. A nuclear bomb with the yield of the Nagasaki bomb could be manufactured with a couple of kilograms of plutonium. Even though civilian plutonium emanating from energy reactors is not weapon-grade and directly usable for a bomb, it still has some destructive powers.  We need to ensure that promoting the closed cycle method does not spread even more nuclear weapons. Serious attempts are being made to limit the dangers of proliferation in reprocessing, for example, by keeping plutonium and uranium mixed during reprocessing or by appointing a number of countries that reprocess the spent fuel of other nations under international safeguards. The latter procedure occurs in Europe, where France and Britain reprocess spent fuel for countries using the closed fuel cycle that do not hold reprocessing plants. But there is an even better prospect for easing the future burden: the development of so-called fast reactors capable of reducing the lifetime of radioactive waste to a couple of hundred years. This involves the development of extended closed fuel cycles based on multiple recycling and new reactor technology. This method, referred to as Partitioning and Transmutation, or P&T, has been scientifically proven but may require decades of development before it can be practically applied. Nonetheless, P&T represents a potential breakthrough that could genuinely transform the debate. Advertisement Several countries that use nuclear power on a big scale, including China, India and Britain, have decided to build more reactors. Moreover, smaller members of the nuclear energy club with longstanding reservations over future expansion, such as Switzerland and the Netherlands, are now re-evaluating their stance. Meanwhile, there is a growing, much under-recognized, push elsewhere in the world toward the adoption of nuclear energy. The International Atomic Energy Agency currently estimates that some 50 countries will have nuclear reactors by 2030 — up from 29 today — with the latest entrant to the club being Iran, which announced recently that it has begun to fuel its Bushehr plant. If these projections are borne out, the 436 nuclear reactors currently operable around the world will be joined by more than 500 others within the next few decades. This trend doesn’t make the decision Angela Merkel faces any easier. Indeed, a recent opinion survey by Forsa, an independent polling institute, found that while 46 percent of respondents favor extending the life of Germany’s 17 existing reactors, 46 percent want them shut down. The split illustrates why the development of new fuel cycles like P&T technology should move to the fore of nuclear energy policy considerations, alongside greater discussion of the pros and cons of the open fuel and closed fuel cycle models. The debate needs to become less vociferous and more enlightened — and more reflective of the quest for intergenerational justice.

"Russia Declares Deal to Join Trade Group","Advertisement By ELLEN BARRY NOV. 3, 2011  MOSCOW — A Russian negotiator announced late on Wednesday that Russia had reached an agreement with Georgia that would clear the path for Russia to join the World Trade Organization after 18 years of delay, ambivalence and frustration. Maksim Y. Medvedkov, Russia’s envoy to the talks in Geneva, said Moscow had agreed to a Swiss-mediated proposal that would allow for the monitoring of trade flow between Russia and Georgia, the Itar-Tass news agency reported. Mr. Medvedkov said the monitoring plan “does not depart from the framework of Russia’s principled position.” “We are pleased that Georgia supports the project, and that an agreement has finally been reached,” he said. Envoys from the two countries will meet on Thursday in Geneva to confirm that they are in agreement, and a formal document could be signed next week, said Georgia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergi Kapanadze. “We have been waiting for the Russian response,” said Mr. Kapanadze, preparing to board a late-night flight to Switzerland from Tbilisi. Advertisement If Georgia and Russia sign an agreement, Russia’s entry to the trade organization could be approved at the group’s ministerial meeting in December. Advertisement Russia has come close to accession several times, only to have the process derailed by geopolitical shocks, like its 2008 war with Georgia, or by surprise announcements, like Russia’s declaration that it would join only as part of a trade union with Belarus and Kazakhstan. The project was approached with new energy last year as an element of the reset in relations between the United States and Russia, though its outcome has remained uncertain. Among the central questions has been whether Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin actually wanted Russia to join. Conservatives in his inner circle have opposed accession, in part because industries may face stiffer competition. Last month, when he was asked about the costs and benefits of membership, Mr. Putin’s response was “50-50, but over all there are probably more pluses than minuses.” The announcement on Wednesday suggests that he has been convinced by the arguments of liberal economists that membership will bring long-term benefits. It also suggests that despite his bristling language, Mr. Putin has a lasting desire to integrate Russia into the world’s great power alliances, a choice that could affect the country’s long-term trajectory. Because accession to the trade group is a consensus process, Russia had to gain the consent of Georgia, a member, overcoming the hostility that has divided the two countries since they went to war in 2008. Russia has built military bases in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, two separatist enclaves that make up a large portion of Georgia’s territory, and Moscow has recognized them as sovereign nations. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter. You must select a newsletter to subscribe to. In exchange for its consent, Georgia sought transparency of trade on its border with Russia, a delicate issue because two sections of that border abut Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Russian leaders said Georgia’s demands were political, and urged Western governments — in particular, the United States — to pressure Georgia into giving its consent. The trade monitoring proposal put forward by Switzerland would station observers in three places: at the main crossing from Russia into Abkhazia; at the Roki Tunnel, which cuts through the Caucasian Ridge into South Ossetia; and at a mountainous crossing into central Georgia, Mr. Kapanadze said. Though Georgia initially sought observers representing governments or public entities like the European Union, its negotiators last week said they would accept private contractors hired by public entities. After Georgia signed on to the plan, Russia asked that Switzerland oversee the contractors, Mr. Kapanadze said. Advertisement Observers will be stationed on the Russian and Georgian sides of the border, though not inside the enclaves, Mr. Kapanadze said. He said on Thursday morning that he had not spoken with Mr. Medvedkov, but that he assumed that any unresolved issues were minor. “It has to be the same deal; there is only one paper,” he said. He said it was early to reflect on the progress: “I will understand it when the signature has been sealed. Until then, I cannot speculate.” The formal announcement of a deal, if it occurs in the coming days, is likely to meet with criticism on many fronts. A popular Russian daily newspaper, Moskovsky Komsomolets, published an article on Tuesday with the headline, “World Trade of Reputation: Russia Can Join the W.T.O. in December if It Compromises Its Sovereignty.” In the United States, the House speaker, John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, said last week that the White House should not support Russia’s accession until it respected Georgia’s borders, including withdrawing troops from Abkhazia and South Ossetia. It remains to be seen whether Russia, as a member, will adhere to the group’s commitments. A senior Obama administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said United States leaders were “encouraged by the progress that Russia has made both in the last two years and in the last few weeks.” “President Obama has made Russia’s W.T.O. membership a top priority for U.S.-Russia relations in 2011,” the official said. “Completing this negotiation will demonstrate that the U.S. and Russia continue to work together to produce results that benefit the American and Russian people.” A version of this article appears in print on November 3, 2011, on Page A10 of the New York edition with the headline: Russia Declares Deal to Join Trade Group.

"What Will a New Army Chief Mean for Pakistan and the Neighborhood?","Since it was announced last month that Pakistanâs army chief, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, would be retiring, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has kept the country dangling on his choice, creating a new parlor game for the chattering classes in the process. General Kayani has been characteristically mum, except for an unusual press release that said he was leaving the office on Nov. 29, without closing out other options, even as he accepted the concurrent role of chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Mr. Sharif could begin consolidating his power by making an early and firm choice to replace General Kayani. Explaining the reason behind the choice would end speculation about the process. Currently, the only certainty appears to be the fact that there will be a new army chief come the end of November 2013 and whoever gets the prime minister’s nod will be a changed person after that, for the office in many ways makes the man. The top five in order of seniority all are highly trained professionals, each with certain proven qualities and different backgrounds. All except one are Punjabis, an unusual coincidence in a military that has a substantial Pakhtun presence and at a time when the army is fighting a war inside its borders in the Pakhtun territories. The prime minister should be looking for a leader who will inspire the army’s rank and file, bruised by a seemingly never-ending conflict against their own countrymen. Someone who has war-fighting experience or has been part of the transformation of the Pakistani Army from a conventional army to one trained also for asymmetrical warfare. Someone who will not necessarily agree with the prime minister on everything but will be discreet in offering frank advice and let the prime minister make the policy decisions after that. Someone who will keep the army away from politics and not be a counterweight to civil power. Someone who will remain in the background and allow the transition to civilian supremacy occur over time. General Kayani, who took over from Gen. Pervez Musharraf, was a soldier at heart. He immediately headed to the forward lines of the war inside the Federally Administered Tribal Areas and made many such trips to see and to be seen with his soldiers and officers who were fighting and dying in alarming numbers. Why didn’t General Musharraf make such trips? Why didn’t the civilian leadership also do the same? That mystery remains. General Kayani also designated his first year as the Year of the Soldier and the second year of his first term to be the Year of Training. The latter was an uphill battle since an army at war has little time for training. He kept foreign relationships alive but played his cards close to his chest and surprised his American interlocutors by acting in what he perceived to be Pakistani interests, especially on the Afghan conflict. He also encouraged opening discussions with India on a broad range of issues, though his innate caution led him to tug back the government when it seemed to be moving too quickly on some fronts. His decision in 2010 to accept the three-year extension that President Asif Ali Zardari offered left a question mark on his tenure since it created a sense of indispensability and broke the career trajectory of a number of deserving generals, one of whom would have succeeded him. One day, we hope he will share his thoughts on that process and the reason it happened. By the time his second term ended, there was a huge gap between him and his newest corps commanders: some 16 courses at least at the Pakistan Military Academy; a lifetime in military circles. This gap was similar to the ones that faced General Mohammad Zia ul-Haq and General Musharraf earlier. It creates a negative dynamic, not just by making collegial decision-making difficult between such a senior chief and his corps commanders but also by stunting independent thinking as groupthink takes root in an organization that is colored by one man’s thought processes and preferences over time. Such a situation creates a culture where a request for comments is often marked by many a “Yes” and some “Of course!” During his tenure, General Kayani tried to alter the outlook of the army on the true enemy of the nation. His speech at the Pakistan Military Academy on Aug. 14, 2012, reflected his views and was seen as a shift away from what was called an Indo-centric view to fighting a war within Pakistan: The war against extremism and terrorism is not only the armyâs war, but that of the whole nation. We as a nation must stand united against this threat. The armyâs success is dependent on the will and support of the people. Under General Kayani, the new army doctrine finally came out, and though written in the opaque hybridized language of academia and the military — an odd combination — for the first time, it spoke of Pakistan facing a “multifaceted threat.” Instead of naming India as the only threat to Pakistan, it talked of multiple threats and tried to focus attention on the internal war being fought by the Pakistan Army. For some reason, General Kayani chose not to pursue that tack in his public utterances, allowing the civilian government to open dialogue with India on a host of issues, including trade, but demanding that progress needed to be on a broad front. His approach seemed to be “all or nothing at all.” This effectively put the brakes on any breakthrough between the two countries, given the weak coalition government of the Peoples Party on the one hand and the weak coalition led by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in India. Mr. Sharif allowed that drift to continue. General Kayani’s offer to demilitarize Siachen Glacier after the April 2012 avalanche killed 140 Pakistani soldiers and civilians met with a brusque rebuff by India and provoked a bitter debate inside India on why it needed to protect that frozen wasteland from Pakistan and potentially China. The flare-up of firings across the Line of Control in Kashmir in 2013 added to a growing mistrust between India and Pakistan. A thoughtful man, who read whenever he had the time, General Kayani was an unusual autodidact, quite unlike his predecessor, who was not known to read much and relied mainly on oral briefings and conversations to formulate his views. General Kayani used private conversations to test his ideas but only after reading up on the subject matter. He believed strongly in his ability to present a logic and structure to his ideas, although it is unclear how effective that was in changing minds of his interlocutors, especially in the White House. There, his unsolicited and unusual presentation of his white paper on the pitfalls facing the American strategy in Afghanistan and Pakistan’s role in that situation met a cool reception after he handed the document over directly to President Obama. One American official harshly characterized the paper as “sophomoric.” Yet, President Obama, who also relies on academic and logical frameworks for his own presentations, may have found some use in the paper, which opened a window into General Kayani’s thinking. Whether General Kayani changed any minds in Washington remains an open question. General Kayani’s abiding legacy will remain one of a general who resisted the temptation to directly intervene in politics, choosing instead to stay in the shadows — not surprising, given his background as former head of the Inter-Services Intelligence directorate, and despite the call to intervene from many in the political system. For that, he will be remembered kindly. Prime Minister Sharifâs choice of the new army chief will help define his third tenure. He has selected four army chiefs in the past, some of whom viscerally shunned politics but found himself at odds with all for different reasons. One, Gen. Asif Nawaz, died in office in 1993; another, Gen. Abdul Waheed, persuaded Mr. Sharif and then-President Ghulam Ishaq Khan to resign simultaneously in 1993. A third, Gen. Jehangir Karamat, resigned in 1996. The fourth, General Musharraf, upended Mr. Sharifâs government in 1999 after the Kargil War debacle and after Mr. Sharif sought American help to end that conflict with India. The prime minister will have another shot at naming an army chief three years hence, if he completes his own five-year term. In that sense, the choice this month is important to continue the trajectory of civilian control of the military and must be matched by civilian competence and responsibility. If all this were to happen and Mr. Sharif selects the professional of his choosing and two consecutive military transitions occur on his watch, without any extensions or back-room deals, Mr. Sharif will have put his stamp on governance, and Pakistan wins. Indiaâs national elections began April 7 and will continue on nine separate dates until May 12, with results expected to be announced on May 16. The vote is the worldâs largest, with 814 million eligible voters set to choose 543 members of the lower house of Parliament. The other two seats will be appointed by the president. This election is widely considered to be Indiaâs most consequential since 1977. India Ink will be moving to the World page of The New York Times.

"China and Russia: the world's new superpower axis?","Countries are trade partners with a shared goal of challenging US hegemony, but past disputes and competing interests make the relationship more complex  Emma Graham-Harrison in Beijing,  Alec Luhn in Moscow,  Shaun Walker in Moscow, Ami Sedghi and  Mark Rice-Oxley  Tue 7 Jul 2015 05.00 BST   Last modified on Wed 12 Apr 2017 15.15 BST   Forget euro summits and G7 gatherings: for the countries that like to style themselves as the world’s rising powers, the real summitry takes place this week in central Russia, where Vladimir Putin will hold court. Leaders of the Brics countries (Brazil, India, China and South Africa) will meet Putin in Ufa on Wednesday, then make way for the Asian powers grouped in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. Russia and China are the common denominators, as in so much geopolitics these days. The UN security council, Apec, the G20 - Russia and China are the ever-presents, a powerful pairing whose interests coincide more often than not. Moscow and Beijing have lots in common apart from a 2,500-mile border, economies dominated by state-run firms and oligarchies that can enrich themselves as long as they play by the prevailing political mood of the day. Officially, Putin is dismissive about suggestions of a new eastern alliance. “We are not creating a military alliance with China,” he said last month. “We are not creating a bloc-based approach, we are trying to create a global approach.” And yet both countries share a desire to limit American power; they enjoy a burgeoning trade relationship in which, in essence, hydrocarbons are swapped for cheap consumer goods; and they have a mutual interest in promoting an alternative model to western diplomacy. Trade has increased sixfold over the past decade. Last year they trumpeted the biggest gas deal in history. The summer will be bookended by two striking events: Russian and Chinese warships puttering about together in the eastern Mediterranean in May, gaming war; and Russian and Chinese presidents standing shoulder to shoulder in Beijing for the 70th anniversary of the end of the second world war in September. So how robust is the Russia-China axis? For China, one of the main attractions of closer relations with Russia is the potential for challenging Washington’s still dominant global position. “In China, where until recently the official line was ‘non-alignment’, some prominent scholars have started to make unambiguous calls for a comprehensive strategic alliance with Russia,” Alexander Korolev, at the National University of Singapore’s centre on Asia and globalisation, argued recently . “[They are] arguing on the pages of the CCP [Communist party] central party school’s internal publications that ‘China-Russia strategic relations are the most substantive ones’ and elsewhere that ‘China will be unable to shift the world from unipolarity to bipolarity unless it forms a formal alliance with Russia.’” But often cooperation and tension are two sides of the same coin. Take Central Asia. China’s president, Xi Jinping , has set his sights on a “new silk road”, using China’s billions to help neighbours and regional allies to develop, indirectly supporting growth at home and the expansion of Chinese soft power. However, this is also Russia’s traditional sphere of influence and any Chinese presence that goes beyond commercial dealings is likely to raise hackles in Moscow. “It’s totally possible for China to develop its relations with central Asian countries without challenging Russia,” said Liu Jun, a Russian studies expert at East China Normal University. “It’s true that Russia would be concerned if China’s influence in Central Asia grew too much, but the concerns are not mainstream in the bilateral relations – there are more benefits in cooperation than otherwise.” Russia shares the strategic goal of challenging US hegemony in favour of a more multipolar world, and the two powers often find themselves on the same side in the UN security council, where they wield vetoes as permanent members. No deal on regulating Iran’s nuclear programme can be made without Russia and China, which have staunchly backed its atomic expansion in the past, and the two countries’ support is largely the reason Bashar al-Assad has been able to hold on to power in Syria. Recently, Russia has been making political and economic overtures to North Korea, which relies on food, arms and energy from its key ally, China, to survive. As they support the idea of a multipolar world against American dominance, Moscow and Beijing will also tacitly back each others’ attempts to defend their own spheres of influence, said Dmitry Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Centre. In the past two years, Russia has annexed Crimea and backed a separatist campaign to frustrate Ukraine’s turn to the west, and China has been disputing islands with western allies in the South China Sea. “China admits de facto that Russia has interests in eastern Europe , Russia admits that China has interests around the perimeter of its borders, and even though neither will actively help its partner in Ukraine or the South China Sea, both will observe an advantageous neutrality,” Trenin said. “There won’t be criticism of each other in the areas of their core interests.” Government enthusiasm for warmer ties with Russia is summed up by a recent video from the state-controlled Xinhua news agency entitled What Do Chinese People Think About Russia?” It features Chinese children describing Russia as “even bigger than China”, an old man praising Russia’s strength, demands for more investment, gas sales, a high-speed train, and plenty of airtime given to adulation of the Russian president. Putin has long been popular in China, where he is seen as a strong leader who has bolstered national pride, and is not a little admired for his topless photo shoots. “Putin you’re a handsome man,” says one middle-aged woman on being asked what message she would like to send to Moscow. There is also an overt comparison to Xi, who has fostered a personality cult of bold leadership that has echoes of the Russian leader’s (though with less bare flesh). “Putin is the same as our ‘Papa Xi’,” says one young man, using a government endorsed affectionate term for the president. For their part, Russians are more ambivalent about Xi, who has a far lower profile in Russia than does his counterpart in China. China’s interest in Russian exports has until now been largely focused on natural resources and military hardware. Beyond that they do not make natural partners. Russia can offer little by way of famous brands or innovation in consumer technology to tempt ordinary Chinese customers. “It’s a good thing that there is political will behind the business cooperation. Without it, a lot of things won’t happen,” Liu said. “Most big projects are backed by the governments and the volume of trade along the border is quite small.” The imbalance of the relationship can be seen in the breakdown of their bilateral trade, worth around $100bn a year. China is Russia’s second largest trading partner after the EU, while Russia only just scraped into a list of China’s top 10 trading partners, accounting for barely 3% of the country’s total trade volume. Moscow is also hoping Beijing will help with finance for businesses, after western funds dried up last year. Some Chinese firms have seen the Russian economic wobble as an opportunity to make capital investments in the country. China and Russia should make natural partners in energy deals, but in reality they have struggled to turn past agreements into real supply deals; pipelines announced last decade have still not been built because of disagreements over pricing and other conditions. Earlier this year, Russia overtook Saudi Arabia as the largest supplier of oil to China for the first time, with Russian exports to China more than doubling since 2010. But Beijing is accustomed to shopping around for energy and driving a very cheap bargain with its suppliers, while Russia is used to controlling prices for European customers with few other options. The expansion of shale gas production may have weakened Russia’s hand by improving global supply, but China is also increasingly concerned about climate change and needs to wean itself off the dirty coal that still provides well over half its energy. Since Russia has rarely agreed to sell stakes in strategic land-based deposits to western companies, Putin’s offer of a stake in state oil champion Rosneft’s biggest production asset, the Vankor oilfields, to China in September underlined the new direction the country’s energy policy is taking. The offer was made at a ceremony to start construction of Russia’s $55bn Power of Siberia pipeline, a breakthrough project that is planned to deliver an annual 38bn cubic metres of gas to eastern China over the next 30 years. In November, the two countries also signed a framework agreement for an Altai gas pipeline to potentially supply 30bn cubic metres of gas to western China each year for 30 years. But neither pipeline deal appears to have been completely finalised, and economic sanctions and a weak rouble will probably make financing the huge projects difficult for Russia’s Gazprom. “It seems like at every meeting there’s some sort of document signed and hailed as another big agreement … but Gazprom will need to develop large fields and construct the pipelines,” said Grigory Birg, an analyst at Investcafe. “I think in the current environment securing the finances is the major holdup, and we don’t have any indication as to the economics of the project.” Although Birg estimated the rate of return on the Power of Siberia investment to be a modest 9% to 10% when the deal was signed, the profitability is likely to be even less if global oil prices remain weak. Beijing will, by all appearances, be able to drive an even harder bargain for the gas price under the proposed Altai pipeline to western China, a region that has less demand than the industrialised east of the country and already receives cheap gas from nearby Turkmenistan. Nonetheless, analysts expect energy cooperation to continue to grow as Russia seeks alternatives to the politically thorny European market, and China addresses growing demand and problems with pollution and blackouts. Last year, China replaced Germany as Russia’s biggest buyer of crude oil. “China is the major alternative market and is easily accessible for Russia given the [location of energy] reserves and the geopolitical partnership, so it’s an obvious fit,” Birg said. “But the timing at which it is happening is not in favour of Russia.” Both Russia and China have an interest in loosening the US dollar’s dominance in global trade as the world’s reserve currency. Russia now accepts yuan for oil payments (something that other oil exporters, such as Saudi Arabia, don’t do). Following the imposition of sanctions, Russian companies and banks – traditionally reliant on dollar-denominated syndicated loans – started to look to China for a financial escape route. The rouble-yuan currency pair reached records in trading volumes last summer. Russian companies are not new to the renminbi market, nor to the issuing of “dim sum bonds” – bonds denominated in Chinese yuan and largely issued by entities based in China or Hong Kong. In the past these options represented a cheaper source of funding. Now they’re a necessity. However, yields on Russian corporate bonds denominated in yuan have increased as the list of sanctions started mounting up. Russian arms sales to China have been estimated at $1bn a year, the Russians were previously hesitant to give advanced weaponry to the Soviet Union’s one-time military rival. But the recent announcement by Russia’s state arms exporter of a deal to supply China with its S-400 surface-to-air missile systems has taken their relationship to a new level at a time when Beijing is seeking new air and naval defence technologies. The higher-level arms sales have been accompanied by greater military cooperation, which was on display in May with the war games in the Mediterranean Sea. Such exercises in what has traditionally been a “Nato pond” are designed to expand the Chinese navy’s reach while showing the United States that Russia is a potentially important military partner, according to Trenin. Following the Ukraine crisis, which soured relations with the west, he said the main considerations behind Russia’s “entente” with China were political. “Now Russia has an important stimulus to grow relations with China, because relations with the west are troubled, and China is the only large player in the world that can be considered as economic, political and to a certain extent military ally,” Trenin said. China and Russia have repeatedly stated that they will become partners, not allies Both sides, meanwhile, are concerned that the unrest in Pakistan and Afghanistan could spill over into their territory, or serve as incubators for militants who may one day return home. But none of that means that either side has forgotten past disputes or present differences. Russia is nervous about China sapping its revenue by reverse engineering the equipment it buys, and is also monitoring Beijing closely for any attempts to project military power into central Asia. “China and Russia’s strategic partnership is a result of the times, but it is totally different from a military alliance such as the one between the US and Japan,” the Global Times, a Chinese nationalist tabloid, said in a recent editorial. “China and Russia have repeatedly stated that they will become partners, not allies. They do mean that. China also cares about relations with western countries. Russia does not want to see relations with the west become a deadlock.”  Both Russia and China share a concern over the US domination of the internet. In January, Russia, China and a number of central Asian dictatorships jointly submitted a new proposal for an international code of conduct on information security to the UN general assembly. In a clause clearly aimed at the US, the document calls for countries “not to use information and communications technologies and … networks to interfere in the internal affairs of other states or with the aim of undermining their political, economic and social stability”. At a recent internet security forum in Moscow, officials from both countries called for a new approach to online security. “It’s great they [the US] invented the iPhone but when you open your iPhone and see the camera you have to guess whether it’s photographing you at that moment or not,” said Konstantin Malofeyev, a controversial businessman known for his backing for the Russian Orthodox church and the pro-Russian separatist movement in east Ukraine. “Russia went into space first and Antarctic first but we don’t control those things, they are controlled by international charters. Why should the US control the internet?” Chinese official Chen Xiaohua said: “We should join hands to build cyberspace order. Various countries share a consistent vision of enhancing the governance of cyberspace … following the principles of mutual trust and mutual respect.” In the meantime, Beijing and Moscow signed a landmark cyber-security deal recently that could bolster defence against external attack as well as allowing them to share technology for domestic control. The two countries have poured resources into managing the internet, aiming to curb its potential as a platform for dissent. Beijing’s “great firewall” is a powerful and sophisticated filter of the online world, but is still porous enough that most people inside China do not need to bother trying to evade it. Both countries also field armies of both hackers and paid pro-government commenters, known in China as the “50 cent” group, because of how much they are paid for each post. However, experts say their focus on internal controls may have come at the expense of security. “Prioritising political information control over technical cyber defence also damages China’s own cybersecurity,” Jon Lindsay of Harvard University’s Belfer centre for science and international affairs said in a recent briefing . “Lax law enforcement and poor cyber defences leave the country vulnerable to both cyber criminals and foreign spies.” Among some business people, there is a fear that the enforced turn to the east will mean Russia selling out from a position of weakness. “The downturn in relations with the west is bad for Russia and bad for the west; the only beneficiary is China,” one top Russian businessman said. “The number of Chinese delegations coming to Russia has gone up tenfold, and the Chinese will only enter the market when they see the conditions are very beneficial to them.” Russian media have been told to play up links with China and other non-western countries, and companies have felt pressure from the government to look eastwards even if it makes little business sense. But what initially seemed pointless may be starting to bear some fruit. “It started as theatre, but now there are some companies out there really getting stuff done,” said Tom Blackwell, CEO of EM, a consultancy firm that has worked with a number of major Russian companies on exploring the Chinese market. “Chinese investment funds have very little experience or knowledge about Russia and it’s a hard sell. But the strategy seems to be to do the big state deals first and assume smaller ones will follow. Slowly, real things are happening.” Russia’s federal migration service is especially wary of an influx of Chinese migrants across the Russia-China border. It has stated that Chinese could become the largest ethnic group in Russia’s far east by the 2020s or 2030s; last summer a border official said that 1.5 million Chinese illegally entered the region from January 2013 to June 2014."
"Unvarnished Conclusions After Covering, and Uncovering, the White House","Advertisement By GARY J. BASS JAN. 12, 2009  Last Sept. 2, Barack Obama went into the F.B.I. building in Chicago to get a 90-minute secret briefing from  Mike McConnell, director of national intelligence, about the world Mr. Obama would face if he won the presidency. As David E. Sanger recounts in “The Inheritance,” Mr. McConnell warned Mr. Obama about a sickening range of intractable problems: Al Qaeda ’s regrouping along the ungoverned border between Pakistan and Afghanistan, Iran’s headlong progress toward getting nuclear weapons, totalitarian North Korea’s expanding nuclear arsenal, Russian belligerence, an overheating planet —  and more. The sensible reaction would have been to walk outside and drop out of the race immediately. Rarely will a president enter office so thoroughly challenged on Day 1 as Mr. Obama. This dazzling and mordantly hilarious book is a history of how we got into this particular ditch. Mr. Sanger, the chief Washington correspondent for The New York Times, drops the strict detachment of a daily reporter and lets rip, delivering a withering indictment of his longtime subject: President George W. Bush ’s foreign policy, which he writes “has left us less admired by our allies, less feared by our enemies and less capable of convincing the rest of the world that our economic and political model is worthy of emulation.” After seven years covering Mr. Bush, Mr. Sanger, a shrewd and insightful strategic thinker, is left stunned by “the president’s inexplicable resistance, until the final quarter of his term in office, to changing course.” Mr. Bush, he says, saw strategic change and negotiation as signs of weakness. This is a Nixon who never went to China. These unvarnished conclusions by Mr. Sanger will of course confirm the perfidy that Karl Rove and Bill O’Reilly presume lies in the black hearts of Times reporters. But Mr. Sanger’s criticism, the product of extraordinarily diligent reporting, is too hawkish to be easily dismissed by conservatives. He believes in putting brute military power behind diplomacy, wants to win the war in Afghanistan and hates the thought of a nuclear-armed Iran and North Korea. Advertisement Unlike other accounts of Mr. Bush’s foreign policy, “The Inheritance” is not about Iraq but about the crushing opportunity costs paid elsewhere for that quagmire. With America bogged down in Iraq, a rising China has expanded its global influence. Mr. Sanger reports of the peril from unsecured nuclear arsenals:  “As the situation in Iraq worsened, the post-9/11 efforts to create a multilayered defense against a domestic W.M.D. attack waned.” Advertisement The ripples from Iraq go as far as Darfur, Sudan’s ravaged western region.  According to Mr. Sanger’s interviews with senior administration officials, Condoleezza Rice told Mr. Bush, “I don’t think you can invade another Muslim country during this administration, even for the best of reasons.” The Iraq war hobbled America’s ability to threaten North Korea and Iran credibly. Mr. Sanger points out that in 2003, as North Korea kicked out international weapons inspectors and raced to complete the fuel for perhaps six nuclear weapons, the Bush administration was gunning to invade nuclear-free Iraq. “Had a few other things on our mind,” said a senior Bush administration official, when Mr. Sanger reminded him that the North Korean crisis was unfolding at the same time. Most directly, Mr. Sanger bats back at the argument made forcefully to him in 2007 by Stephen J. Hadley, Mr. Bush’s national security adviser, that the administration never shortchanged Afghanistan because of Iraq. Mr. Sanger writes, “Time and again, Afghanistan  —  the country where the 9/11 plot was hatched  —  was overshadowed by the war in Iraq.” When Gen. Dan K. McNeill, commanding NATO forces in Afghanistan, called the White House in the winter of 2008 to ask for about 37,000 more American troops, he was rebuffed. According to Mr. Sanger, crucial Special Forces units, seasoned combat troops and C.I.A. personnel were shuffled over to Iraq, taking pressure off Al Qaeda and the Taliban. New Predator drones were sent to Iraq, not Afghanistan. “We’re simply in a world of limited resources, and those resources are in Iraq,” a senior administration official told Mr. Sanger. “Anyone who tells you differently is blowing smoke.” Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter. You must select a newsletter to subscribe to. Mr. Sanger’s book is a Woodwardian trove of inside dope. He draws upon his own interviews with Mr. Bush, Ms. Rice, Robert M. Gates, Colin L. Powell, Pervez Musharraf and many more. He offers astonishing details on how the C.I.A. penetrated A. Q. Khan’s network of nuclear technology for sale and sabotaged some of Iran’s efforts to get nuclear technology. And he has a terrifying chapter in which he describes Pakistan’s unsteady efforts to keep Islamist radicals from infiltrating or stealing from its burgeoning nuclear weapons program, bolstered with $100 million of secret American aid. “The Inheritance” offers up a painfully long catalog of squandered opportunities. Mr. Sanger slams Mr. Bush for not exploring the post-Sept. 11 possibilities of an alliance of convenience with Iran against Sunni Arab extremists until the end of his second term and notes that in 2005, at a potentially opportune diplomatic moment when Iran had only a few centrifuges to enrich uranium, Mr. Bush was preoccupied with Iraq. Advertisement Mr. Sanger quotes Christopher R. Hill, the skillful veteran diplomat spearheading the joint American and Asian effort to denuclearize North Korea, on administration hard-liners: “These”  —  here an epithet unprintable in The New York Times  — “don’t know how to negotiate. Everything is Appomattox. It’s just ‘Come out with your hands up.’ ” Looking forward, Mr. Sanger delivers a series of hard truths. He states bluntly that it may take decades before American troops can leave Afghanistan without risking a Taliban return to power. He reports about a July 2007 American intelligence assessment that Al Qaeda, sheltered in Pakistan, had, in Mr. Sanger’s words, “reorganized its command structure and was once again planning attacks against the United States.” Unless something big changes, he writes, Iran will get nuclear weapons, which will most likely start Egyptian and Saudi nuclear programs in response. Of course, some of the problems that bedeviled Mr. Bush also confounded other presidents, from Lyndon B. Johnson to Bill Clinton, who failed to stop China, Israel, India and Pakistan from getting nuclear weapons. And Mr. Bush has some achievements to point to: soberly handling China, helping create the six-party talks as a promising framework for future Asian security and upgrading America’s commitment to fighting the AIDS pandemic. Still, Mr. Bush has taken to citing Harry S. Truman, implying that history will vindicate his legacy in Iraq and beyond. “The Inheritance” is a devastatingly effective pre-emptive strike against that.

"Nonlinearity, Multiple Equilibria, and the Problem of Too Much Fun (Wonkish)","There’s been another blogospheric debate on methodology, this time involving a currently fashionable critique of mainstream macroeconomics — namely, that it’s too reliant on linear models and fails to make allowance for multiple equilibria. Frances Coppola and Wolfgang Munchau are leading the charge, with Roger Farmer (I think) in support; Brad DeLong and Tony Yates beg to differ. So do I. There’s plenty wrong with macroeconomics as practiced, and plenty more wrong with macroeconomists as practitioners — and I haven’t been shy about pointing these failings out. But this is the wrong line of attack, for two reasons. First, claims that mainstream economists never think about, and/or lack the tools to consider, nonlinear stuff and multiple equilibria and all that are just wrong. Tony Yates notes Munchau declaring that the zero lower bound is a minefield that economists have avoided; what? As Yates says, The implication is âooh, look at this really obvious real world thingy that economists just canât deal withâ.  But actually, they can and do, and itâs embraced by 100s of papers now, since Krugman wrote the first modern one in 1998. What about multiple equilibria? Well, most of my academic macroeconomic work is in international macro, especially on currency crises, and in that sub-field multiple equilibria — oh, and the effects of leverage and balance sheet effects — is a long-standing part of the approach. Here’s my 1999 paper on a multiple-equilibrium approach to the Asian financial crisis. For that matter, Diamond-Dybvig — the standard model for thinking about bank runs — is all about multiple equilibria and self-fulfilling prophecies. So if your assertion is that economists don’t have the tools to think about such things, and/or are too boring and conventional to go there, well, that’s just uninformed. Been there, done that. But maybe the complaint is simply that economists don’t do enough nonlinear analysis. And I can say personally that while I am, I think, pretty well aware of the possibilities of multiple equilibria and all that, they aren’t the staple of my analysis. There is, however, a reason for that: that kind of stuff is too easy and too much fun. When you first start playing around with multiple-equilibrium models — in my generation that generally happened in grad school — there’s a period of enthusiasm. Crazy things can happen! Anything can happen! I can write down a model in which X leads to Z instead of Y! Also, you can call spirits from the vasty deep. But will they come when you do call? The point is that it’s quite easy, if you’re moderately good at pushing symbols around, to write down models where nonlinearity leads to funny stuff. But showing that this bears any relationship to things that happen in the real world is a lot harder, so nonlinear modeling all too easily turns into a game with no rules — tennis without a net. And in my case, at least, I ended up with the guiding principle that models with funny stuff should be invoked only when clearly necessary; you should always try for a more humdrum explanation. So, was the crisis something that requires novel multiple-equilibrium models to understand? That’s far from obvious. The run-up to crisis looks to me more like Shiller-type irrational exuberance. The events of 2008 do have a multiple-equilibrium feel to them, but not in a novel way: once you realized that shadow banking had recreated the hazards of unregulated traditional banking, all you had to do was pull Diamond-Dybvig off the shelf. And since the crisis struck, as I’ve argued many times, simple Hicksian macro — little equilibrium models with some real-world adjustments — has been stunningly successful. Notice, by the way, that in the linked post I do include the zero lower bound — no minefield here — which in turn makes the model nonlinear, with a qualitative change in behavior when the economy is sufficiently depressed that the zero bound is binding. But all that comes straight out of a quite simple framework, with no huffing and puffing and diatribes against conventional economics. As I said, there are plenty of problems with economics. But I’d argue that ranting about the need for new models is not helpful; in policy terms, our problem has been refusal to use the pretty successful models we already have.

"The Palestinians' Long Wait in Lebanon","Advertisement By JOSH WOOD MARCH 2, 2011  BEIRUT — Lebanon hands out and renews hundreds of thousands of work permits every year to people from Africa, Asia and other Arab countries. But until now, only a handful have been given to the country’s large Palestinian refugee population. Six months ago, the Lebanese government was internationally applauded for passing legislation granting the Palestinian population the right to work. But real changes remain to be seen. On Feb. 22, the caretaker labor minister, Boutros Harb, signed a decree on carrying out the August 2010 labor law amendments. Final approval by the Shura Council, the country’s highest court, is now awaited. Meanwhile, questions about the potential effectiveness of the legislation and the employment situation of the refugees linger. “What we have now is, we have a legal framework, we have a technical framework,” said Nada al-Nashif, the regional director of the International Labor Organization , an agency of the United Nations. “These are logistical parts of the equation. “Now of course you have to overcome lots of mistrust, a lack of confidence, lots of fears imbedded in the system through a rather negative experience over the years, for the Palestinian population especially.” Advertisement The Palestinian refugee population, variously estimated at 260,000 to 400,000, has long had a tense relationship with its Lebanese hosts. Palestinian militias exacerbated the country’s civil war, and many Lebanese have feared that broader rights for the refugees could lead to their naturalization, complicating the country’s already delicate sectarian balance of political power. As a result, Palestinians have faced institutionalized and non-institutionalized discrimination while remaining wary and skeptical of their Lebanese counterparts. Advertisement Under the labor law amendments about to go into effect, Palestinians will be able to acquire work permits more easily, a change seen as pivotal to easing the historically conflicted relationship. A December 2010 study released by the American University of Beirut found that only 37 percent of working age Palestinians in Lebanon were employed. The same study — which the university says is the largest socioeconomic survey of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon in the past decade — also shed light on the poverty of their population, showing that Palestinian refugees spent on average just $170 per month. “It’s not that the Palestinians don’t want to work — it’s that they have become increasingly discouraged,” said Ms. Nashif, the U.N. agency regional director. She was commenting on the legal barriers that until now have cornered most Palestinians, if they work at all, into menial jobs, often in the informal underground economy. The amendments are the first move to legalize the working status of Palestinians since the first refugees arrived, fleeing the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. “The whole point of the Palestinians not being able to work here was that you couldn’t work in Palestine as a Lebanese,” Ms. Nashif said. “That’s fine, but they don’t have a country, so it’s a bit moot at this point.” Apart from the issue of reciprocity, the 62-year delay in establishing work rights for Palestinians has reflected the often uneasy relationship between the refugees and the Lebanese government. More recently, the six-month delay between the passing of the amendments and their implementation has been a result of Lebanon’s ongoing political crisis and an attempt to smooth out some of the details. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter. You must select a newsletter to subscribe to. But with a solidly established pattern of Palestinians finding employment in the informal sector of the economy, a newly acquired right to get work permits more easily may have limited practical consequences. “It doesn’t interest the Palestinian worker and it doesn’t interest the employer — because employers are interested in Palestinians because they are a black market,” said Sari Hanafi, an associate professor at the American University of Beirut. Advertisement The change, Mr. Hanafi said, “will have a tiny impact.” Even with the legal reform, Palestinians will continue to be barred from working in syndicated professions, including as medicine, law and engineering. “Unless the liberal professions are addressed,” Mr. Hanafi said, “this law doesn’t have any impact.” The inability to work in Lebanon, meanwhile, has also limited migrant work opportunities. “If we want to apply outside, the first thing they ask for is the experience — and we can’t get the experience because we can’t work,” said Rasha Shehadeh, a 26-year-old Palestinian from a Beirut refugee camp who received a degree in nursing several years ago. “I’m stuck because I can’t work outside, because I don’t have the experience and because I’m Palestinian, so my papers won’t be processed.” Despite experiencing major shortages as Lebanese nurses are lured by higher wages abroad, nursing remains a syndicated profession in Lebanon and therefore is off limits to Palestinians. Still, while carrying out reforms may not be a cure-all for the economic hardships facing Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, the action still signals a shift in the way the Lebanese government views the community. “The symbolism of the decision, when the Parliament passed the amendments in August, should not be underestimated,” said Salvatore Lombardo, the director of Lebanese affairs for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, which provides assistance to Palestinian refugees across the region. “This is the first time that we have had a national debate in the Parliament about Palestinians’ rights in Lebanon.” For Palestinians in Lebanon, work rights, however important, are only one step toward greater freedoms. Many issues — like the right to own land — have yet to be resolved. “While I fully recognize the importance of these amendments,” Mr. Lombardo said, “more needs to be done in the coming months to improve the conditions for Palestinian refugees in Lebanon.” A version of this article appears in print on March 3, 2011, in The International Herald Tribune.

"","Advertisement  By  The New York Times  How the election and Donald Trump’s victory looks to Opinion writers.  By  Beverly Gage  In his victory speech last night, Donald J. Trump paid homage to “the forgotten men and women of our country,” vowing that they “will be forgotten no longer.” This essential political idea — that a vast segment of the nation’s white citizens have been overlooked, or looked down upon — has driven every major realignment in American politics since the New Deal. In 1932, at the darkest moment of the Great Depression, Franklin Roosevelt evoked the “forgotten man” as a reason to rebuild the economy from the “bottom up.” More than three decades later, after Richard Nixon’s 1968 victory, the journalist Peter Schrag identified the “Forgotten American” — the white “lower middle class” voter — as the key to the nation’s apparent rejection of the Great Society and the New Deal order. “In the guise of the working class — or the American yeoman or John Smith — he was once the hero of the civic books, the man that Andrew Jackson called ‘the bone and sinew of the country,’ ” Mr. Schrag wrote. “Now he is ‘the forgotten man,’ perhaps the most alienated person in America.” That this “forgotten” American could be used both to uphold and to dismantle liberalism suggests that this American political identity has never been especially fixed: Democrat or Republican, liberal or conservative, but populist above all. Since the 1960s, the phrase has also implied that the country was paying too much attention to the wrong sorts of people — most notably, to African-Americans — at the expense of the white working class.
It is no coincidence that the “forgotten men and women of our country” began their migration into the Republican Party at the very moment that African-Americans were asserting their right to vote, and voting Democratic, in large numbers for the first time. Mr. Trump’s victory will go down as one of the great upsets in United States history, but it is also the product of a long and bitter struggle over race and class in this country. The Yale sociologist William Graham Sumner is often credited with coining the term “forgotten man.” Writing near the dawn of the Progressive Era, he lamented the lost autonomy of hard-working citizens suddenly forced to pay for high-flown programs of social reform. Sumner’s most famous political essay, “What the Social Classes Owe to Each Other,” rejected the very idea that government might mitigate class antagonisms by sharing the social wealth. What did social classes owe to each other? Not much, in Sumner’s view. And his “forgotten man” owed the least of all. In his 1932 campaign for the presidency, Roosevelt sought to claim the term for a different and more expansive purpose. “These unhappy times call for the building of plans that rest upon the forgotten,” he said in a radio address from Albany in April 1932, for plans “that build from the bottom up and not from the top down, that put their faith once more in the forgotten man at the bottom of the economic pyramid.” To Roosevelt, the “forgotten man” encompassed the industrial worker and struggling farmer and Keynesian consumer — ordinary citizens without whom a modern economy would falter. He built the New Deal around this image, establishing the minimum wage, Social Security and the federal right to organize unions. Those reforms cemented the loyalty of the white working class to the Democratic Party for a generation. But the New Deal also “forgot” — or excluded — many people, including African-Americans. When the Great Society came along, Lyndon Johnson tried to make up for that by expanding federal programs serving the poor and by championing the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts. As the country started to “remember” its long-delayed promises of equality, however, the “forgotten American” began to emerge as term of exclusion and resistance to change. “There is hardly a language to describe him, or even a set of social statistics,” Mr. Schrag wrote in his August 1969 essay, “ The Forgotten American .” “Just names: racist-bigot-redneck-ethnic-Irish-Italian-Pole-Hunkie-Yahoo. The lower middle class. A blank.” As Mr. Schrag noted, all of that name-calling was part of the problem, a refusal on the part of liberal elites to recognize the real grievances and desires of what had once been a bedrock Democratic constituency. In the 1968 campaign, Nixon capitalized on this resentment with calls for “law and order,” a phrase that evoked not only fears of crime, but also anger at protesters and rioters and the college-campus liberals who tolerated them. Mr. Trump put that phrase back into political circulation in 2016, a gesture of solidarity with the old ways of thinking about the “silent majority” — and the “forgotten American.” And though he included “men and women” in his victory speech, Mr. Trump’s campaign mobilized around the same image that once animated the Roosevelt coalition: the “forgotten” white working-class man. Race, too, remains an indelible part of today’s conversation about who has been “forgotten” and who deserves to be seen. To dismiss this language as simple racism, however, is to miss at least some of its political significance. What happened in the late 1960s and 1970s was not only that the Republican Party reclaimed and redefined Roosevelt’s “forgotten man” for a more conservative age. During those years, the Democratic Party itself began to turn away from the New Deal and its working-class politics, especially from its commitment to organized labor. With Mr. Trump’s election, we may be witnessing the rise of a new party system, with the Democrats now the standard-bearers of racial tolerance and free-market globalization, and the Republicans the party of nationalist populist revolt. But as Roosevelt showed, this need not be a fixed political equation. If the 2016 election marks the final, gasping end of the New Deal coalition, it should also mark the start of a new reckoning within the Democratic Party.  By  Daniel K. Williams  Donald J. Trump was elected with a higher percentage of the white evangelical vote than any other Republican presidential candidate has ever received, and he has received strong support from prominent Christian Right leaders. Yet if Mr. Trump delivers on his promises, he will not give the religious right what its leaders have traditionally demanded or what the Republican Party platform calls for. Indeed, he will give them very little national legislation at all, but will instead offer them maximum latitude to pursue their agenda at the state level — a shift that may portend a potential breakthrough in the nation’s polarizing culture wars. National legislation has long been the goal of the religious right. When the movement emerged in the late 1970s, evangelical leaders such as Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson sought federal constitutional amendments to ban abortion and restore school prayer, because they wanted to reverse what liberal rights activists had done at the national level through the Supreme Court. In the early 21st century, leaders such as James Dobson continued this trend by persuading   President George W. Bush to endorse a constitutional amendment proposal to define marriage as exclusively heterosexual. In recent years, evangelicals have become so concerned about protecting their own religious liberty against federal mandates or court decisions that they have given less attention to imposing a moral agenda on the rest of the nation. Although the Republican Party platform continues to promise a constitutional amendment protecting human life from the moment of conception, the pro-life movement has not made any serious attempts to pass that amendment since the 1980s. Nor has there been much talk in the last decade of a national ban on same-sex marriage. Mr. Trump is well positioned to promote a further shift away from national moral regulation. For much of his adult life, he held culturally libertarian views on abortion and gay rights, and he evinced little interest in the religious right’s agenda. Early in his campaign, he expressed discomfort with conservative evangelicals’ opposition to the rights of transgender people to use the public restroom of their choice. But he quickly came to embrace a “states’ rights” position on same-sex marriage and transgender rights, a position that would allow culturally liberal New Yorkers the right to pursue different policies than cultural conservatives in Mississippi or North Dakota. And while Mr. Trump stumbled over abortion during his campaign, the policy that he ultimately reverted to was to leave abortion legalization up to the states — an outcome that he would try to ensure by nominating conservative Supreme Court justices who might overturn Roe v. Wade. Mr. Trump has gone further than any previous Republican presidential nominee in a generation in insisting that the religious right should enact its agenda at the state, rather than federal, level.  Although this was the policy position of many Republicans during the 1970s (including President Gerald Ford), religious right activists persuaded the G.O.P. in the early 1980s to abandon its states-rights approach to abortion and other social issues, and promise national legislation to implement the religious right’s agenda. Mr. Trump is leading the party back to its more traditional stance. While many liberals will find this outcome unsatisfactory — since it offers them no opportunity to secure national protection for individual rights that they consider inalienable — it may be the only compromise solution that can give both conservatives and liberals the freedom to pursue their own agenda at the local level without fear of a national backlash. If a socially libertarian New Yorker can deliver this compromise to the conservative white rural evangelical voters who put him in office, both conservatives and liberals should see that for what it is: a landmark opportunity to move beyond the culture wars.  By  Marwan Bishara  Just when the people of the Middle East thought things couldn’t get any worse, Donald J. Trump is elected president of the United States. Now, their apprehension about the president-elect dwarfs their disappointment with President Obama. It could be a blessing in disguise. America, in one magic moment, you’ve revealed how you’ve changed. For the worse. Poor you, you feel so insecure, vulnerable and fragile. Like the rest of us. So, instead of reaching for your famed “can-do” spirit, lifting yourselves up by the bootstraps, you turned to a strident, bellicose type of nationalism. The kind usually associated with strutting generalissimos of Third World nations with their chests covered with made-up, self-awarded medals. Maybe the people of the Middle East will look and realize that you are no longer the Great Democracy to emulate. That your modern style of empire and your role as keeper of the world order for the world’s own good are stumbling and failing, even in your own eyes; and that we in the Middle East should not be turning to you for rescue. For as long as I can remember, you’ve been on a self-assigned mission to change the Middle East. Indeed, the world. Now, it seems as if the change has flowed the other way. You’ve voted to reduce your liberties. To narrow the range of people entitled to justice and equality before the law. To live in a place where the police should not be criticized; where fighting political correctness is more important than fighting racism; where Muslims are suspected and people who appear Hispanic can be rounded up if they’re not carrying their papers. In this election you’ve revealed that your people — like Russians, Hungarians, Iraqis, Iranians and others whose politics you normally look down on — will choose a narrow, nonsensical nationalist ethos when they feel threatened by uncertainty. Your imperial outreach allowed you to experience other cultures, but now you’ve chosen to shrink your outlook, with the expectation that the world will continue to revolve around you. It won’t. Like the rest of us, you’re now divided between those who want to make their nation great again alone and those who want to make it great together. O.K., enough about you; let’s talk about us. We in the Middle East can’t decipher what exactly your incoming president wants from us. I don’t think he knows, either. Mr. Trump said he would bring back torture and ban Muslims from entering America, and he compared the threat of “radical Islam” to Soviet Communism. He wants less engagement in the region, and fewer “free riders” like the Saudis who don’t pay enough for American protection. And he wants the United States to abandon the costly nation-building in the Middle East. What nation-building? In Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Yemen, Libya and Somalia, civil wars continue unabated. The Arab and Muslim worlds only hope the United States stops contributing to the destruction.
Mr. Trump does not exactly seem concerned for the wishes of Middle Easterners and their right to live in peace. It sounds more like what he really wants to do is pal around with other strutting, authoritarian types. Expect him to cozy up to Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, and join him in supporting Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad. Expect America’s new president to work closely with Egypt’s president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, and Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. Mr. Trump has embraced Mr. Netanyahu’s positions on Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and on abandoning the two-state solution. Instead of Americanizing the Middle East, Mr. Trump seems set on “Israelizing” America, stirring fear of Muslims and trying to wall out “the other.” Arabs, and Middle Easterners in general, should take one quick look and figure out how to be less dependent on the United States, and how to resolve their conflicts within their own, regional frameworks.
Finally, some good news. President Obama has assured us that the sun will rise tomorrow, regardless. And if the Trump presidency is as bad as I expect it to be — though not so bad that it demolishes democracy entirely — he can be voted out in four years. Meanwhile, fasten your seatbelts. It’s going to be a hell of a ride.  By  Carol Giacomo  A commitment to human rights has been a fundamental precept of NATO since the alliance was created a half century ago. You would not expect that a founding member would have to be reminded of that fact. Certainly not the United States, for all those years the leader of NATO and an inspirational embodiment of its core values. Yet this is where we find ourselves now, the day after Donald Trump won the presidency: In congratulating him on his victory, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany felt compelled to set conditions for cooperation. “Germany and America are connected by values of democracy, freedom and respect for the law and the dignity of man, independent of origin, skin color, religion, gender, sexual orientation or political views,” she said in a statement, adding: “I offer the next President of the United States close cooperation on the basis of these values.” Mr. Trump’s behavior during his campaign was antithetical to those values. He has threatened to ban Muslims from the United States, refuse refugees, deport 11 million undocumented workers and build a wall on the border with Mexico. He has disparaged African Americans, Mexican Americans, women and people with disabilities. Moreover, Mr. Trump has called into question America’s commitment to NATO and displayed a befuddling penchant for defending Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, who is waging war in eastern Ukraine and destabilizing other parts of Europe by supporting far-right groups. He received no pushback on Wednesday from Theresa May, the British prime minister, who simply congratulated Mr. Trump on his win. The two leaders’ reactions were further proof that, after Britain’s decision to leave the European Union, we will have to look to Mrs. Merkel not just to lead Europe but to replace America in leading NATO as well.  By  Gil Troy  “I am scared that if Ronald Reagan gets into office, we are going to see more of the Ku Klux Klan and a resurgence of the Nazi Party,” Coretta Scott King said in November, 1980. “I’m afraid things are going to blow sky high during this next term,” a nursing student said. He’s a “nitwit,” added a Democrat. “He’s shallow, superficial and frightening,” one of that year’s historic numbers of “undecideds” insisted. Ronald Reagan “seems not to relish complexity and subtlety,” the New York Times editorial endorsing President Jimmy Carter’s re-election proclaimed. “The problem is not a loose lip but the simple answer.”  While fearing what Reagan’s own running mate, George H.W. Bush, had dismissed as Reagan’s “voodoo economics” during their primary fight, the editorial board feared “voodoo diplomacy,” too. From coast to coast, half of a divided nation abhorred —  and underestimated — the president-elect. “The American people,“ Hamilton Jordan, a key Carter aide, said, "are not going to elect a 70-year-old, right-wing, ex-movie actor to be president.” Pollsters reported in 1980 that “More voters held negative attitudes toward each presidential candidate than in any campaign since polling began” — a record we just broke in 2016. The economic dislocation of galloping inflation and the energy crisis produced a nasty campaign. Feeling neglected by Washington, millions embraced Ronald Reagan’s populism. Despite the Democratic panic, Ronald Reagan left America richer and safer after two terms as president. Reagan defied expectations by turning toward the center. He acted as president of the United States, not president of the Republican Party. Reagan used the transition period to heal wounds while claiming a broad policy mandate, despite winning only 50.7 percent of the popular vote. He vowed to “rebuild a bipartisan base for American foreign policy.” His cabinet choices were so moderate that Pat Buchanan, the conservative flamethrower whose rhetorical bluster anticipated the advent of Donald Trump, lamented: “Where is the dash, color, and controversy — the customary concomitants of a Reagan campaign?” Just weeks into Reagan’s first term, conservatives were demanding that his aides had to “Let Reagan be Reagan,” meaning: stop being so reasonable. But in adjusting, in tempering, Reagan was being Reagan. He knew the Constitution limited presidential powers — and he faced a Democratic Congress led by the formidable speaker of the House Tip O’Neill to remind him further. Illustrating Richard Neustadt’s lesson that the power of the president is mostly “the power to persuade,” many of Reagan’s achievements were symbolic. Rather than shrinking government as he promised, for example, he only lowered the federal government’s growth rate. History is not destiny. And Reagan had both a lighter touch than Mr. Trump, and eight years’ experience as  governor of California. Still, history is full of shifts and surprises. Mr. Trump must be a healer and unite America, as he tried doing in his victory speech. If he fails, the checks and balances that sometimes help crusading ideologues become effective leaders can ultimately impose a necessary gridlock. When asked about conservatives’ frustration with him, Reagan kindly insisted it was only a “very few” critics. He said: “There are some people who think that you should, on principle, jump off the cliff with the flag flying if you can’t get everything you want.” Reagan recalled that “If I found when I was governor that I could not get 100 percent of what I asked for, I took 80 percent.” So far, Mr. Trump, the political amateur and sputtering demagogue, has lacked Reagan’s magnanimity or his flexibility. Can the reality-show star turned president-elect mimic the actor turned president?  By  James R. Jones  In 1968, there was a demand among voters for change, especially regarding Vietnam and foreign policy, and there was a backlash against some of the Great Society programs. Then, as now, the Democratic candidate was tied to the departing administration and hamstrung to differentiate a new set of policies. As a result, the Democratic presidential nominee, Hubert H. Humphrey, narrowly lost to the Republican, Richard M. Nixon, a candidate who was despised by a large percentage of the electorate. One positive outcome of that election was the first organized transition from the departing to incoming governments. President Lyndon B. Johnson always believed that, after an election, Democrats and Republicans should come together to do what’s right for the country. At the time, I was President Johnson’s appointments secretary, the position that has since evolved into the White House chief of staff. Right after the 1968 results came in, the president put me in charge of organizing a transition process, something that had never been done. “Nixon is an S.O.B., but he’s the only president we’ll have,” Johnson told me. “I want him and all of his team to be fully prepared to govern after the Inauguration at 12 noon on January 20.” A few days later, Johnson and Nixon met at the White House along with Nixon’s top advisers, including H. R. Haldeman and John Mitchell. There we mapped out a program in which all of the Johnson cabinet and major White House staff members would brief their incoming counterparts as often as was desired by the new administration. My charge was to work with Haldeman, who became my successor at the White House, to make sure these briefings occurred across the new administration and in a timely fashion. One surprise was that Nixon told me that Mitchell could speak for him in all matters if he was not available. Johnson would have never delegated such authority, but that was the difference in the management style of the two men. While a smooth transition was important to Johnson, he didn’t stop being president. He was issuing orders and making appointments right up to the morning of the Inauguration. In fact, the day before the Inauguration the president told me to find out how many vacancies existed on commissions and boards and find good people that he could nominate. He kept Nixon waiting in the Blue Room on Inauguration morning while he signed those nominations (which required Senate confirmation) and had them delivered to the Congress before noon. It is a positive sign that President Obama invited Donald J. Trump to meet at the White House two days after this most contentious election. Today transitions are much more institutional now than our first one in 1968. But this process can heal many wounds and start bringing our country closer together. That’s imperative if we want to make our government work for the people again. Back in 1968, Johnson and Nixon left the White House together, along with Senator Everett Dirksen and me. We jumped into the car and headed to the Capitol. Surprisingly, Nixon wanted only to discuss how disappointed he was to have lost Texas (Johnson’s home state) and how determined he was to win it in1972. I hope the ride to the Capitol next January will be more substantive on policy.  By  Sarah Jaffe  If anything has been made clear by the results of this election, it is that the political and pundit class have underestimated the degree of anger and pain in the United States, the degree to which “recovery” has been recovery for a few and stagnation and decline for many more. One exit poll has been haunting me since I saw it: The Reuters/Ipsos early exit poll found that 75 percent of respondents agreed “America needs a strong leader to take the country back from the rich and powerful.” Only slightly fewer agreed that “the American economy is rigged to advantage the rich and powerful,” and — perhaps the kicker — 68 percent believed that “traditional parties and politicians don’t care about people like me.” There’s a lot to unpack in those statements. They may conceal white resentment of the perceived advancement past them of black and Latino people. But they also reveal the sentiment that has been there since the 2008 financial crisis laid bare the lines of power in the country and the world — when, as the protest chant went, “Banks got bailed out, we got sold out.” The downward trends have been with us for decades: the divergence of productivity gains from workers’ incomes, the substitution of credit card debt for raises, the shift of good union jobs and family wages and pensions into low-wage service jobs, and the attendant slashing of the social safety net. But the past eight years sped all that up and made it impossible to ignore. If Donald J. Trump stood out to voters from the rest of the Republican Party, aside from a willingness to say directly the kinds of things usually carefully dogwhistled, it was in his rants about trade and his lack of interest in dismantling the remnants of the welfare state. For white Americans anxiously looking at their disappearing stability, Mr. Trump was a bomb they were willing to throw at a system they felt was failing them. He emotionally echoed their outrage and gave them a place to direct their anger, the age-old right-wing populist trick of refracting it both upward at elites and downward at minorities. Hillary Clinton’s campaign and the mainstream Democratic Party were woefully unprepared to greet this wave. When your response to a cry of “Make America Great Again!” is “America Is Already Great!” you’d better be sure that it feels true to a majority of voters. The results show that it did not. To be sure, Democrats had an uneasy line to walk, between maintaining continuity with a still-popular, twice-elected Barack Obama — a continuity that won Mrs. Clinton the Democratic primary — and reaching the people who wanted and needed change. But the party’s wholehearted backing of Mrs. Clinton was a colossal misreading of a moment when rage at the establishment (of both parties) was simmering everywhere. That rage should have been visible as Mr. Trump ran away with the Republican nomination process despite the opposition of that party’s grandees, and as Bernie Sanders pushed Mrs. Clinton much harder than anyone had expected a gray-haired socialist from Vermont to do. But Mrs. Clinton opened her arms to disaffected Republicans rather than wooing the disaffected within and around her own party. Most of the television ads she ran were more about painting Trump as a dangerous aberration, an outsider unfit for office, than pitching any plan of her own for change. Democrats failed to realize that for many Trump voters, that was exactly what they liked about him.  By  Will Wilkinson  It may not be an exaggeration to say that Donald Trump both knows and cares less about the details of public policy than anyone ever elected president of the United States. This just goes to show that “politics is not about policy,” as Robin Hanson, the futurist and social theorist, likes to say. Mr. Trump’s playbook against Hillary Clinton broke with the hard-won norms of liberal democracy, went back to demagogic, authoritarian political basics, and updated them for  the reality television, social media age. Politics is, at bottom, about factions vying and coordinating to choose leaders in whom to invest authority. Throughout the campaign, Mr. Trump displayed an uncanny and unnerving mastery of the primal politics of authority, and the game of legitimizing his own and delegitimizing his rivals’ claims to authority. In Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump drew a general election opponent pre-weakened by a decades-long Republican campaign of delegitimization. He took advantage of it with shameless audacity, making the most of our culture’s lingering sexism and the popular perception of Mrs. Clinton as a member of an arrogant and corrupt elite that believes it is above the law. But tearing down his opponents was only half of Trump’s equation. The pundits and pollsters so badly botched their predictions in no small part because they failed to grasp the intense, reality-distorting power of Donald Trump’s fame. But Mr. Trump seems to have an intuitive understanding that glamour, celebrity and gaudy wealth are key ingredients in majesty — which is inherently authoritative and underwrites its own claim to legitimacy. Trump’s self-branded personal jet was more than a convenient means of transportation for a very rich man. It was a purple silk, ermine-fringed cape, Air Force One in waiting, and he knew how to use it. The United States, the world’s first nation founded on principled opposition to the pre-Enlightenment politics of majesty and unified authority, has deep-seated norms of republican modesty and propriety. Casting those norms aside and banking heavily on the atavistic political appeal of majestic celebrity gave Mr. Trump an advantage few us were prepared to acknowledge, allowing him to attract the support of an unforeseen numbers of black, Hispanic and female voters, despite his campaign’s naked racism and his scandalously misogynistic and abusive personal history. Because Mr. Trump’s strategy was so indifferent to matters of policy substance, it is incredibly difficult to say what policies Mr. Trump will actually support in office. I don’t think we’ve ever known less about what an incoming president really wants to do with his power. But we do have a clear indication of how he’s likely to wield it. He will cleverly burnish his claim to authority and relentlessly and effectively discredit his opponents, inside and outside the Republican Party, with all the tools of an executive branch that has never been more powerful and less constrained by the constitutional system America’s founders designed specifically as an alternative to and a bulwark against unitary authority.  By  Lindy West  I got up on Election Day and burst into tears — not a genteel twin trickle but a great heaving burst, zero to firehose. Tears spattered the inside of my glasses, dripped from my lips, and left mascara-tinged rosettes blooming black in my cereal milk. “Honey,” my husband crooned to me. “Honey, it’s going to be O.K. The numbers are still good. It’s O.K.” But it wasn’t the numbers. I wasn’t sobbing because I was afraid Hillary Clinton was going to lose. That would come later. I was sobbing Tuesday morning because, as I poured my coffee, I’d caught a glimpse of a cable news interview with Mrs. Clinton just after she voted for herself in Chappaqua, N.Y. She seemed breathless, exhilarated, a little overwhelmed. Over her shoulder, Bill Clinton stared at his wife and beamed. My husband stares at me like that sometimes. It’s not just love — we expect husbands to love their wives — but something less traditional, more conditional and gendered. It’s professional respect. It’s pride. We’re accustomed to that pride flowing the other direction, from wife to husband, because men in our culture get to be more than just bodies, do more than just nurture. Men get to act and excel and climb and aspire and thrive and win and rule and be the audacious, hungry fulcrum of public life. It is normal for men to have ambition. It is normal for women to stand aside. I thought about Bill Clinton meeting Hillary Rodham at Yale in 1971, and how tenacious and intense she must have been even back then, how undeniable and potent. Mr. Clinton describes the moment in his memoir . “She conveyed a sense of strength and self-possession I had rarely seen in anyone, man or woman,“ he wrote. "She was in my face from the start.” He says he once told her , during those years, “I have met all the most gifted people in our generation and you’re the best.” And then I thought about Mr. Clinton rising steadily through his political career, on the track we have built for charismatic, competent white men. He must have known, every second, how good his wife was. Not just good, but “the best.” Better than everyone he’d ever met; better than him, even. And he watched her stand next to him and wait, and wait, and wait, underestimated and degraded and excoriated for wanting more out of life than cookies. And she didn’t quit! She swallowed slander and humiliation and irrational hatred for three decades and she didn’t quit, and here she was, just a hair’s breadth from the presidency of the United States — the first woman ever to be trusted with the rudder of the world. He must be so proud of her, I thought. It made me cry. I cried because I want my daughters to feel that blazing pride, that affirmation of their boundless capacity — not from their husbands, but from their world, from the atmosphere, from inviolable wells of certainty inside themselves. I cried because it’s not fair, and I’m so tired, and every woman I know is so tired. I cried because I don’t even know what it feels like to be taken seriously — not fully, not in that whole, unequivocal, confident way that’s native to handshakes between men. I cried because it does things to you to always come second. Whatever your personal opinion of the Clintons, as politicians or as human beings, that dynamic is real. We, as a culture, do not take women seriously on a profound level. We do not believe women. We do not trust women. We do not like women. I understand that many men cannot see it, and plenty more do not care. I know that many men will read this and laugh, or become defensive, or call me hysterical, or worse, and that’s fine. I am used to it. It doesn’t make me wrong. But maybe this election was the beginning of something new, I thought. Not the death of sexism, but the birth of a world in which women’s inferiority isn’t a given. That grain of hope glowed inside me until around dinner time on Tuesday, the final day of an election so openly misogynist that the question “Sexual assault: good or bad?” was credulously presented for debate. Today doesn’t feel real. It is indistinguishable from fresh, close grief. But if there’s one lesson we can take from Mrs. Clinton, politics aside — and even Donald Trump acknowledged it in the second debate — it’s the limitlessness of human endurance. Those of us who have been left in the cold by this apparent affirmation of a white supremacist patriarchy (and sorry, white women who voted for Mr. Trump, but your shelter is illusory) are tough. We have been weathering this hurricane wall of doubt and violence for so long, and now, more crystalline than ever, we have an enemy and a mandate. We have the smirking apotheosis of our oppression sliming, paw-first, toward our genitals. We have the popular vote. We have proof, in exit polls, that white women will pawn their humanity for the safety of white supremacy. We have abortion pills to stockpile and neighbors to protect and children to teach. We have the right woman to find. We have local elections in a year. The fact that we lost doesn’t make us wrong; the fact that they don’t believe in us doesn’t make us disappear.  By  Seth Grossman  A couple of years ago, I produced a reality-TV show called “Hollywood Hillbillies,” about a family from rural Georgia who, driven by the grandson’s newfound internet fame, moves west to make it in Hollywood. The show centered on the undeniable charisma of “Mema,” the foul-mouthed matriarch who spoke her mind and poked fun at the habits and attitudes of the Los Angeles elite. The show was part of a wave of “redneck reality” shows like “Swamp People,” “Duck Dynasty,” “Bayou Billionaires” and “Moonshiners” that presented a vision of white, rural America as the last authentic place on earth, the last place untarnished by the corruption and cynicism of the elites. “Hollywood Hillbillies” aired on the Reelz Network, a channel owned by a billionaire Republican donor Stanley Hubbard , who funded a pro-Trump “super” PAC after his preferred candidates lost the primaries. Designed as a harmless comedy, the show reveled in Mema’s provocative, off-color remarks, just as Donald J. Trump’s audience revels in his. But now I’m thinking more critically about what shows like this are selling. All of these shows have one thing in common: While trafficking in rural stereotypes, they celebrate wealth and business success — whether that business is crafting hick-hop music, catching alligators or designing duck calls. Ostensibly produced for middle America, they offer a population disenfranchised by globalization and the information economy a vision of rural ingenuity rewarded. Mr. Trump based his candidacy around this population. He spoke directly to voters raised on reality TV, addressing their fears and aspirations with blunt talk. He became their perfect celebrity champion, a rich white man, his image polished by years in a reality-TV boardroom, who validated their demographic anxiety. In an election season driven more by hatred of political opponents than enthusiasm for two deeply unpopular candidates, President-Elect Donald J. Trump hated best, and won. I am wondering today if the same embarrassment that prevents some of us from admitting that we watch “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” also kept Trump supporters from admitting to pollsters that they were voting for a man they knew the media considered a bigot. Two months ago, I started working on a new series, “Trumpigration,” a travel show about where to move if Donald Trump somehow got elected. That, too, was designed as a lighthearted comedy. Now, facing the prospect of four years of a Trump presidency, it’s beginning to feel like the last chance to change the channel.  By  Roberto Suro  If you are in shock over the election results, don’t blame Latinos. They favored Hillary Clinton by better than two to one, according to the exit polls. They did not turn out in big numbers to protest Donald J. Trump, but it probably would not have mattered. It turns out that Latinos were the election’s biggest losers and not just because Mr. Trump won the presidency after a long campaign of slinging threats and insults at them. The bitterest loss was dealt by the 59.5 million mostly white people who voted for Mr. Trump. That was a rejection by their own countrymen. According to the exit polls — a rough measure of turnout at best — Latinos accounted for 11 percent of the votes cast Tuesday the same as 2012. If those numbers hold, there was little or no Trump effect, and however much the number of Latino votes increased was just a result of demography. You may have been convinced that it would be otherwise. Years of reckless commentary, news stories and advocacy insisted that Latinos would be the great demographic firewall that would safeguard progressive politics with surging population numbers. But, the firewall only stands in a few states, and the biggest of them, California, New York and Texas, are already decided. Mr. Trump concentrated instead on the old industrial states where Latinos are a sparse presence. When he demonized Mexico and unauthorized immigrants, he gained more in the Electoral College by mobilizing white voters than he lost by alienating Latinos. The national exit polls show that Mrs. Clinton drew 65 percent of the Latino vote compared with 29 percent for Mr. Trump. That is a landslide by any measure, and it is about the same margin in the exit polls for 2008 (67 percent vs. 31 percent). The disappointment sets in when you compare the outcome to 2012. President Barack Obama took 71 percent of the Latino vote in the exit polls that year compared with 27 percent for Mitt Romney. Mr. Trump was supposed to be the bucket of cold water that aroused the sleeping giant, producing not only a stronger preference for the Democratic candidate but also, more important, a spike in turnout. In 2012, with immigration reform on the line, more than 12 million Latino voters stayed home, producing a turnout rate of 48 percent compared with 64 percent for whites and 67 percent for blacks. The much ballyhooed and chronicled “Trump Effect” was supposed to have produced a surge in naturalizations and voter registration over the past year, and news organizations were churning out stories about the “surge” in Latino voting even after the polls closed Tuesday. While more time and data is needed to get a full picture of Latino turnout this year, at first glance it appears Latino numbers were up, and perhaps significantly in some places, but that in fact the giant was barely stirred. Four million more Latinos were eligible to vote Tuesday than in 2012. So, no matter who was running and no matter how low the turnout, the number of Latino votes counted Tuesday was virtually certain to be higher than 2012. In fact, demographic growth alone would have guaranteed Mrs. Clinton an additional 1.3 million votes (about 1 percent of the total votes cast), even if turnout remained at the same dismal rate as 2012, and she got two-thirds of the Latino votes. In Colorado and Nevada, Latino voters surely helped keep the states blue, and under different scenarios those states could have served as the much-advertised Latino firewall. The one real bright spot for Latino Democrats Tuesday came with the election of Catherine Cortez Masto to the Senate in Nevada. That vote may illustrate what it takes to wake up the Latino electorate: a charismatic and qualified candidate, strong mediating institutions, in this case the hospitality workers’ unions in Las Vegas, and well-organized political operation like the one created by Senator Harry Reid, the retiring Democratic leader. Meanwhile, something may have happened in Texas that needs a closer look. Mr. Trump won handily, but only by a 9 percent margin. President Obama lost the state by nearly 16 points in 2012 and by almost 12 points in 2008. A lot of non-Latino newcomers have begun to change the political complexion of the state in recent years, and that formula — newcomers plus Latinos — is what flipped Colorado and Nevada in the past. Florida is the one place where Latinos might have been able to change the results of this election and didn’t. In the exit polls, Latinos accounted for 18 percent of the total vote compared with 17 in 2012, and the split was slightly more favorable to Mrs. Clinton than it was for President Obama four years ago. Mrs. Clinton’s vote tally was more than 200,000 higher than President Obama’s, but Mr. Trump’s was more than 400,000 higher than Mr. Romney’s. And therein lies the result that Latinos will have to live with for the next four years. In a state that has vividly benefited from immigration and trade, a state where Latinos have for the most part prospered and contributed to the prosperity of their neighbors, white voters mobilized to elect a candidate who would angrily erase everything Latinos represent. No one else suffered that kind of defeat on Tuesday.  By  Kevin M. Kruse  With so many predictions about this presidential campaign having turned out to be so very wrong, comparisons to the 1948 presidential race come naturally. In that election, virtually everyone predicted that the Republican Thomas Dewey would beat the “accidental president,” the Democrat, Harry Truman. Pollsters reinforced these assumptions. Elmer Roper announced that he was so sure Dewey would win that he wouldn’t even bother reporting poll results anymore. “My silence on this point can be construed as an indication that Mr. Dewey is still so clearly ahead that we might as well just listen to his inaugural address,” he said. George Gallup kept polling until mid-October, but then rested on those results, assuming the race was over. Pundits agreed. Newsweek surveyed 50 of the nation’s top political reporters in October; every single one said Dewey would win. Republicans and Democrats alike assumed the race was over. On election night, the conservative Chicago Tribune was so confident it called the race early, rushing out a banner headline that would soon be as famous as it was wrong: “Dewey Defeats Truman.” To the amazement of nearly everyone, Truman won by considerable margins. In the popular vote, he took 49.6 percent to Dewey’s 45.1 percent. In the Electoral College, he won 303 votes to Dewey’s 189. While the margins of this year’s election are narrower, the shock and confusion of pollsters and analysts seems just as pronounced. But comparisons between the Truman and Trump campaigns are not neatly drawn. Truman was an outspoken liberal, and he campaigned on preserving and expanding the accomplishments of the New Deal welfare state. He called for expansion of Social Security, more progressive forms of taxation, a higher minimum wage, and a new national system of health insurance. Truman also committed the Democratic Party, long dominated by Southern segregationists, to a new racial liberalism. Notably, he called on Congress to protect the voting rights of African-Americans. In foreign policy, Truman set America against the growing influence of the Soviet Union. In 1947, he announced the Truman Doctrine, which prompted economic aid to Europe through the Marshall Plan and military alliances through a new North Atlantic Treaty Organization. A year later, Truman challenged Soviet expansionism with the Berlin Airlift. Mr. Trump has rejected much of the substance of Truman’s campaign, but in many ways he reflected its style. Truman’s famous “whistle-stop campaign” took him to rural communities and small towns where working-class and middle-class whites felt neglected. In fiery speeches with blunt language, he singled out sources of blame. Truman went after the “do nothing” Republican Congress as a prominent foe, but also denounced an array of “special interests,” including “bloodsuckers who have offices on Wall Street.” Truman named these enemies and promised to “give ’em’ hell.” His crowds believed him and rallied to their candidate. On Election Day, he predicted there were would be “a lot of surprised pollsters.” There were. Though he had reason to gloat, Truman was gracious in victory. The day after the election, the Washington Post staff invited him to a “crow banquet.” All the newspaper pundits, radio commentators and pollsters who predicted his defeat would wear sackcloth and force down a main course of crow; the president, in white tie and tails, would be served roast turkey. Truman declined, saying he had “no desire to crow over anybody or to see anybody eat crow, figuratively or otherwise.” He added, “We should all get together now and make a country in which everybody can eat turkey whenever he pleases.” Mr. Trump is not a politician who operates by anyone else’s playbook, but perhaps in this small but important matter, he can take a lesson from history.  By  Maureen Sullivan  I have to admit it: I am loving it. As the results poured in for Donald J. Trump, I reveled in the Facebook friends who openly mourned the end of humanity. I felt gleeful in trolling the Twitter hashtag #HesNotMyPresident: “I’m laying in bed with tears streaming down my face, just thinking about the future of this country.” This was one of the biggest election upsets in history, so of course everyone is stunned. Me too. Switching among three cable news networks and several websites I wondered: Is he really going to take Florida so easily? Did they just call North Carolina for Trump? Can he possibly win Wisconsin? Pennsylvania? Yup. I rooted for Mitt Romney in 2012 and John McCain in 2008. I ran for the school board in Hoboken, N.J., and lost once before winning the following year. I know what it’s like to have your hopes puddle up on the floor like that dollop of election-night Haagen-Dazs that you dropped and you just don’t care to wipe up. What does it matter? All is lost. You want to announce on Twitter that you are in bed letting the tears stream down your face. I saw this result coming over the summer. In July, five police officers were ambushed in Dallas and three more were killed in Baton Rouge. In August, Colin Kaepernick, the San Francisco 49ers quarterback, sat out the national anthem. In September, an Islamic terrorist, masquerading as a fried chicken salesman in my hometown, Elizabeth, N.J., set off bombs in New York and New Jersey. Mrs. Clinton proclaimed: “I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police.” She put half of Trump’s supporters in that “basket of deplorables.” People I know were angry. They were tired of being told they were racist and bigoted as they went about the business of mowing their lawns, writing college tuition checks and working their jobs as cops, secretaries and teachers’ aides. They kept being told they needed to look inward, examine their sins and judge themselves guilty. They had not forgotten when Barack Obama was running for president in 2008 and his wife, Michelle, said, “For the first time in my adult lifetime, I’m really proud of my country…” So now we have President-Elect Donald Trump. I supported him because he promised to curb regulations, cut taxes and appoint constitutionalists to the Supreme Court. I supported him because Mrs. Clinton doesn’t have what it takes to turn around a stagnant economy or stand up to the special interests that block innovation. In his victory speech, Mr. Trump lifted a line from Abraham Lincoln and spoke of “binding wounds.” I wanted him to be gracious and kind in that moment, and he was. My 89-year-old mother is still appalled by my vote and tells me, with a laugh, that she’s moving to Ireland. And one of my disappointed female friends on Facebook — who, like me is white and college-educated — wrote, “Obama helped expose the deeply racist nature of our country. Trump exposes the anti-intellectual, sexist xenophobia.” But most of my friends, some of whom I suspect cast votes like mine, have stayed quiet. I guess it’s still not politically correct to admit that you are on the Trump train.  By  Viet Thanh Nguyen  Worst-case scenario in the next four years: fascism, a wall, mass deportations, the end of Obamacare, a Trump brand on the White House and either a trade war or an actual war with China (since war is the easiest diversion from domestic unhappiness). Best-case scenario: Ruth Bader Ginsburg refuses to retire or die, the Democratic Party finds a backbone, turns away from its fixation on the center and heeds the call for an economic revolt against the 1 percent, joined by Black Lives Matter, the Occupy movement, and resurgent feminism. Both scenarios could happen at the same time. The second scenario requires Democrats to put their status quo political model to rest. They already had a significant portion of the nonwhite minority vote locked up, but have lost too many working-class white people. Bernie Sanders might not have won over the wealthier whites who were voting with Trump against the seemingly rising tide of minorities, but he might have snared the white working class and some of the white middle class. Here’s the bright side, for those, like me, who are on the liberal-to-left spectrum. If Hillary Clinton had won, she would have run again in 2020, which could have meant four more years of Wall Street liberalism and fire-and-forget perpetual warfare, conducted by drones and Special Operations over the horizon. Now perhaps Elizabeth Warren will be the 2020 Democratic candidate — a white woman, a feminist, and someone more progressive than Clinton. But all this speaks largely about domestic electoral politics. The sickness of the American body politic remains untreated, and will remain untreated, or exacerbated, in a country run by clowns, conspirators, and collaborators. That sickness is imperialism. America is an imperial country, and its decay might now be showing. The power that has brought so much benefit to the country — for white people — is now faltering in its ability to provide those benefits to all white people. The empire’s best hope is to be more inclusive, demographically and economically, but that runs counter to the imperial impulse to hoard power and profit. Warren or someone like her might be better at extracting more social and economic justice for all Americans. But unless such a person finds a way to ease control from the financial-industrial complex, the prospects of halting our decline are weak. Empires rot from the inside even as emperors blame the barbarians.  By  Robert N. Stavins  Donald J. Trump once tweeted that “the concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing noncompetitive.” Twitter messages may not be clear signs of likely public policies, but Mr. Trump followed up during the campaign with his “America First Energy Plan,” which would rescind all of President Obama’s actions on climate change. The plan includes canceling United States participation in the Paris climate agreement and stopping all American funding of United Nations climate change programs. It also includes abandoning the Clean Power Plan, a mainstay of the Obama administration’s approach to achieving its emissions reduction target for carbon dioxide under the Paris agreement. What should we make of such campaign promises? Taking Mr. Trump at his word, he will surely seek to pull the country out of the Paris pact. But because the agreement has already come into force, under the rules, any party must wait three years before requesting to withdraw, followed by a one-year notice period. Those rules would seem to be mere technicalities. The incoming Trump administration simply can disregard America’s pledge to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 26 to 28 percent below the 2005 level by 2025. That is bad enough. But the big worry is what other key countries, including the world’s largest emitter, China, as well as India and Brazil, will do if the United States reneges on its pledge. The result could be that the Paris agreement unravels, taking it from the 97 percent of global emissions currently covered by the pact to little more than the European Union’s 10 percent share. In addition, Mr. Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency probably will stop work on regulations of methane emissions (a very potent greenhouse gas) from existing oil and gas operations. Undoing complex existing regulations, such as the Clean Power Plan, will be more difficult, but a reconstituted Supreme Court will probably help President Trump when that plan inevitably comes before the court. Also, the new president will most likely ask that the Keystone XL pipeline permit application be renewed — and facilitate other oil and gas pipelines around the country. On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump promised to “bring back” the coal industry by cutting environmental regulations. That may not be so easy. The decline of that industry and related employment has been caused by technological changes in mining, and competition from low-priced natural gas for electricity generation, not by environmental regulations. At the same time, Mr. Trump has pledged to promote fracking for oil and gas, but that would make natural gas even more economically attractive, and accelerate the elimination of coal-sector jobs. If he lives up to his campaign rhetoric, Mr. Trump may indeed be able to reverse course on climate change policy, increasing the threat to our planet, and in the process destroy much of the Obama legacy in this important realm. This will make the states even more important players on this critical issue.  By  Dani Rodrik  The real costs of a Donald J. Trump presidency will most likely come on the political rather than on the economic side. We are likely to see some rise in trade barriers and unilateral economic policies. But for all his bluster, I do not expect Mr. Trump to engage in indiscriminate protectionism. We live in a world of supply chains where imposing tariffs on Mexican or Chinese imports will raise costs of United States businesses and make it hard for them to compete. Mr. Trump is a businessman, and he will understand soon, if he does not now, the senselessness of blanket protectionism. We may have plenty of trade disputes with foreign countries. It’s useful to bear in mind here the example of the 1980s, when trade frictions with Japan and other leading exporters produced a slew of so-called new protectionist barriers such as voluntary export restraints. But these did very limited damage to the world economy. Before long, the world embarked on a further and more intense round of globalization. Furthermore, we have robust international institutions, like the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization, that did not exist in the interwar period. And the political lobbies in favor of an open economy (big business and banks) are stronger and retain considerable influence in Washington. So even though the 1930s parallel is on everyone’s mind, I do not think we are in for a collapse of the international economic order and a retreat into trade war. The real danger Mr. Trump poses is the undermining of our politics — the norms that sustain our liberal democracies. His campaign was based on a divisive politics of identity. Ideals of equity, equal rights, diversity and inclusion were submerged under the weight of a rhetoric that raised racial and ethnic tensions and inflamed passions against imagined enemies — Mexican immigrants, Chinese exporters, Muslim refugees. Illiberal democracy has been the bane of several nations around the world. Under Mr. Trump, the traditions in the United States of checks and balances and of rule of law will be tested seriously. The political danger will be greatly magnified by Mr. Trump’s likely economic failure. He comes into office as the putative leader of middle and lower classes who feel they have been left behind. He has raised their expectations in ways that he cannot meet. There is little chance that incomes at the middle and lower end of income distribution will receive a large boost under his policies. The manufacturing jobs that have left will not return no matter how tough Mr. Trump’s trade policies get. These jobs have disappeared for good, largely thanks to technological changes, and not trade. When the full scale of his economic disappointment sinks in sometime during his term, Mr. Trump may well react in the time-honored fashion of global populists like President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. To keep his base mobilized and insulate himself from economic troubles, he may take shelter in an intensified form of the identity politics that worked so well for him during the presidential campaign. This would rip American society further apart along racial and ethnic cleavages. The ugliness that characterized politics during the presidential campaign may be nothing compared with what may be yet to come.  By  Teresa Tritch  Financial markets regained their footing on Wednesday, as investors and traders apparently concluded that a Donald Trump presidency might not be so bad after all. Instead of focusing on how unprepared Mr. Trump is to be president, several traders quoted in the media talked about how deregulation from ending Obamacare and the Dodd-Frank financial reforms — two Republican goals — could lift stock prices for health care companies and banks. They took special solace in Mr. Trump’s promise to boost government spending on infrastructure and in the measured tones of his acceptance speech. Unfortunately, there is no escaping the overarching conclusion that Mr. Trump’s campaign promises, if carried out, would harm the economy. His proposed rollback of Dodd-Frank reforms would invite renewed recklessness. His opposition to Obamacare would renew and intensify households’ financial insecurity. His proposed tax cuts for the rich would exacerbate income inequality, while either blowing a hole in the deficit or requiring deep budget cuts. His stance on trade would impair international commerce and cooperation. His proposed deportation of immigrants would unleash a legal and humanitarian crisis. Even his popular call for more infrastructure spending is flawed. In and of itself, Mr. Trump’s pledge to borrow vast sums to spend on infrastructure would be a sensible move at this time of low interest rates. But vastly increased federal indebtedness in addition to his other harmful economic policies would be piling risk on top of risk. Risk-taking that crosses the line into recklessness can be immensely profitable in the short run, which is what many traders care most about. But it is no way to run an economy on which everyone else depends for long-term prosperity.  By  Emily Bazelon  Now it looks like a warning shot. When Justice Antonin Scalia died in February, Donald Trump was among the first to call for stonewalling President Obama’s choice to fill the seat. “It’s called delay, delay, delay,” he said at the opening of the Republican presidential debate on Feb. 13. Senator Harry Reid, the minority leader, countered that it would be “unprecedented in recent history” for the Supreme Court to go a year without a full complement of justices. But other Republicans, chief among them the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, agreed with Mr. Trump and Senator Ted Cruz: Justice Scalia’s seat should remain vacant until after the election. Undeterred (what else was he supposed to be?), President Obama nominated Merrick Garland, a seasoned judge praised in the past by Republicans like Senator Orrin Hatch. A debate ensued over historical facts, which seems quaintly polite in retrospect. Since 1900, had the Senate ever refused to confirm a nominee in a presidential election year as a result of the impending election? The answer was no (even if Mr. Cruz tried to argue, against the facts, that Justice Anthony Kennedy wasn’t confirmed in the election year of 1988.) The Republicans’ refusal to grant Judge Garland a hearing or schedule a vote was in fact unprecedented. It was a new kind of hardball. And it succeeded. For a blip in August, Republicans took a hit in the polls for  obstructing the Garland nomination. But the moment passed, blown away in the chaos and battle of the presidential election. Judge Garland slipped from view. The parties adapted to a new reality in which both expected either his postelection, pre-inauguration confirmation, or a new nominee chosen by the next president. When they assumed Hillary Clinton would win, Republicans including Senators John McCain of Arizona  and Richard Burr of North Carolina talked about blocking Democratic Supreme Court picks indefinitely. Both were re-elected Tuesday and will return to a Senate still controlled by the Republicans. It’s hard to see how any Republican paid a price for radically altering the norms for Supreme Court appointments. Mr. Trump helped point the way, and the voters rewarded him and those who followed. Choosing a justice in Antonin Scalia’s mold, as he has promised, will allow Mr. Trump to prove himself to the social conservatives for whom the court, and Roe v. Wade, are the defining issues. Under the current rules, Democrats could filibuster his choice, but if that happens, how long will those rules last? 
Mr. Trump’s election has already run over far stronger traditions and norms. Next comes the question of how many additional Supreme Court appointments will come his way. Ruth Bader Ginsburg is 83. Anthony Kennedy is 80. Stephen Breyer is 78. In Supreme Court terms, four years is a long time.  By  Peter Wehner  To say that Donald Trump’s victory was a shock may qualify as the understatement of the century. The polls were wrong. The experts were wrong. I was wrong. Almost everyone was wrong — including those in the Trump campaign who expected to lose. His victory wasn’t just a surprise; it was an event of gigantic dimensions, its radiating effects incalculable. Mr. Trump’s win ranks among the most unlikely and stunning elections in American history. Regardless of how the Trump presidency turns out, this race will be studied a century from now. For those of us who have been vehement critics of Mr. Trump, this is a rather challenging moment. Starting on Jan. 20, he will be the only president we have. He now has a democratic legitimacy we may regret but cannot deny, and there is such a thing as democratic grace. To those who are tempted only to rage and attack and lament what has occurred, a word of counsel to them, and to myself: We need to give Mr. Trump the chance to rise to the moment, as unlikely as we think that may be. At the same time, we can’t possibly erase the history of the last 17 months — the words he said, the things he did, the conspiracy theories he wove, the ignorance, volatility and cruelty he showed — and our concerns aren’t going to evaporate now that he’s about to be in charge of the nuclear triad that during the campaign he didn’t even know existed. I believed, and still believe, that he is a man with a disordered personality and authoritarian tendencies. My job is to give him a chance to prove me wrong; his job is to prove me wrong. Among my worries is that Mr. Trump’s victory will validate his style of politics, his serrated rhetoric. The way he mistreats people will be normalized. This election has brought us to dark places. Rather than this approach being repudiated it will, for many, become a model. “All the decent drapery of life is to be rudely torn off,” in the words of Edmund Burke. If the Trump campaign foreshadows his presidency, America under Trump will be fundamentally different than it has been — coarser, less temperate and civilized, more inward and resentful. The Republican Party will fundamentally change, from a conservative party to one that champions European-style ethnic nationalism. (The Democratic Party, whose members were certain Hillary Clinton would win, will be convulsed as it enters a period of intense recrimination.) A few hours after Mr. Trump was declared the winner, I received a note from a friend of mine, the distinguished Christian writer Philip Yancey, who told me, “I’m surprised and befuddled, but not scared, thanks to the checks-and-balances strength of American democracy. I tremble, though, to think what an unpredictable leader offers to a world in growing crisis.” He added, “Some say God moves in mysterious ways.  I say, God grants humans the freedom to move in even more mysterious ways.” What happened on Nov. 8th was a mystery that may lead to calamity. I hope to God it won’t.  By  Anna North  I spent the days leading up to the election in Pennsylvania talking to some young voters , 18, 19, 20 years old. They wore flowered Doc Martens, fake fur coats, earbuds dangling from one ear. Overwhelmingly, they were open and polite. They were smart. They were angry at a political system they felt ignored them, but they hoped for better days ahead. In January, Donald Trump will be their next president. Many of these young people supported Mr. Trump. Many did so reluctantly. One young Trump supporter told me that no one knows exactly what Mr. Trump will do in office. Another described hesitating while filling out his absentee ballot, wondering if he could vote for a man who had made abhorrent comments about women. But some voted for Mr. Trump enthusiastically. Those who supported Hillary Clinton were disgusted by Mr. Trump and what he stands for. Today, they’re dealing with a new reality they didn’t expect. I’m thinking of Bria Blackshear, a 20-year-old Temple University student who had waited more than an hour at her polling place in north Philadelphia. “Donald Trump doesn’t represent the ideals I would want for this country,” she said. I’m thinking of Brooke Renner, 18, also a Temple student, who was waiting in line for a second time. She’d given up earlier, but was back and willing to wait as long as it took to cast her vote for Mrs. Clinton. Otherwise, she said, “I’d feel personally responsible if Donald Trump wins.” I’m thinking of Sierra Taylor, a 19-year-old student at the Community College of Philadelphia, who said, “black people feel like our votes don’t matter.” I’m thinking of her friend Naiya Johnson, 22, who, when asked about her hopes for the next four years, said, “I hope we make it.” I’m also thinking of the young people I saw debating the issues that matter to them. Of the table full of young men at Bucks County Community College arguing about Mr. Trump when one, the quietest, spoke up to say, “Trump has no respect for women.” Of the young man, who, as his friend criticized Mrs. Clinton’s record as secretary of state, interjected that Mr. Trump is racist, sexist and xenophobic. They’d had the argument once before, they said. I hope they keep talking. I think they will. It’s a frightening time to grow up. But these young voters are clear-eyed about the shortcomings of government and optimistic enough to imagine a better world. They can make friends with people of different viewpoints, and, when it matters, they can challenge their friends to think in a new way.  By  Seamus McGraw  BRODHEADSVILLE, Pa. — Thinking back now, I can’t for the life of me figure out how I got it so wrong. He seemed so troubled by what he was about to do, as if he knew it was a mistake, but one he felt compelled to make. The way I read the pained look on his face, I thought he was almost apologizing; maybe seeking a kind of absolution. It was just a few days before the election, and I had been canvassing for the Democrats. I wasn’t out there because I was a particularly ardent Clinton supporter. She had certainly not been my first choice, my second or even my third. I’m one of those middle-aged white men without a college degree who had been holding out for Joe Biden to change his mind. But I felt as if I had an obligation to make certain that, at least in my little corner of Pennsylvania, a man who was, to my mind, so obviously unsuited to the highest office in the world, was not just defeated, but repudiated. I expected that my neighbors and friends and the strangers down the road would do just that. Sure, I could feel and even share their frustration over the fact that the longest postwar economic recovery had left so many of my neighbors behind. I had been left behind, too. And yes, I understood the fear of an uncertain world, and the stress of profound cultural changes that were upending so many things that my neighbors took as bedrock values. But I thought the character traits that had always defined the people I knew in eastern Pennsylvania — true conservatives with a sense of responsibility and decency — would in the end lead them to reject “Trumpism,” whatever that actually is. My job wasn’t to help Clinton win. I thought — or at least the pundits were telling me — that was a done deal. The way I saw it, my only task was to drive up her margins and to do that, I was working off a carefully curated list of likely Clinton voters thoughtfully provided to me by the local campaign office. And so when I knocked on this gentleman’s door on a back road in the rural, conservative West End of Monroe County, and he told me that he was indeed planning on voting for Donald Trump, I was ready to simply turn away. But he wouldn’t let me go. “I just can’t trust her,” he said. He made eye contact and kept it. Relentlessly. He and I were of the same rough demographic. Just like me, he was well into his 50s, with teeth that had seen better days. Just like me, he was lower middle class, judging from his surroundings. And as he rattled off a list of shopworn talking points — Benghazi, emails, pay for play — I felt as if I was hearing a stranger’s confession. I felt as if he wanted me to understand and forgive him for what he was about to do. I remember thinking to myself that when this was over, I was going to have to find a way to build a bridge back to this guy who was, in so many ways, just like me. Such was my arrogance. Late last night, as I watched Pennsylvania turn red for the first time in a generation, I kept thinking back to that man, and how I so misread his expression and his words. It wasn’t sorrow etched in his face. It was pity. For me. Because he knew, long before I did, how wrong I was.  —  Seamus McGraw is the author of “Betting the Farm on a Drought.”   By  Beverly Gage  In his victory speech last night, Donald J. Trump paid homage to “the forgotten men and women of our country,” vowing that they “will be forgotten no longer.” This essential political idea — that a vast segment of the nation’s white citizens have been overlooked, or looked down upon — has driven every major realignment in American politics since the New Deal. In 1932, at the darkest moment of the Great Depression, Franklin Roosevelt evoked the “forgotten man” as a reason to rebuild the economy from the “bottom up.” More than three decades later, after Richard Nixon’s 1968 victory, the journalist Peter Schrag identified the “Forgotten American” — the white “lower middle class” voter — as the key to the nation’s apparent rejection of the Great Society and the New Deal order. “In the guise of the working class — or the American yeoman or John Smith — he was once the hero of the civic books, the man that Andrew Jackson called ‘the bone and sinew of the country,’ ” Mr. Schrag wrote. “Now he is ‘the forgotten man,’ perhaps the most alienated person in America.” That this “forgotten” American could be used both to uphold and to dismantle liberalism suggests that this American political identity has never been especially fixed: Democrat or Republican, liberal or conservative, but populist above all. Since the 1960s, the phrase has also implied that the country was paying too much attention to the wrong sorts of people — most notably, to African-Americans — at the expense of the white working class.
It is no coincidence that the “forgotten men and women of our country” began their migration into the Republican Party at the very moment that African-Americans were asserting their right to vote, and voting Democratic, in large numbers for the first time. Mr. Trump’s victory will go down as one of the great upsets in United States history, but it is also the product of a long and bitter struggle over race and class in this country. The Yale sociologist William Graham Sumner is often credited with coining the term “forgotten man.” Writing near the dawn of the Progressive Era, he lamented the lost autonomy of hard-working citizens suddenly forced to pay for high-flown programs of social reform. Sumner’s most famous political essay, “What the Social Classes Owe to Each Other,” rejected the very idea that government might mitigate class antagonisms by sharing the social wealth. What did social classes owe to each other? Not much, in Sumner’s view. And his “forgotten man” owed the least of all. In his 1932 campaign for the presidency, Roosevelt sought to claim the term for a different and more expansive purpose. “These unhappy times call for the building of plans that rest upon the forgotten,” he said in a radio address from Albany in April 1932, for plans “that build from the bottom up and not from the top down, that put their faith once more in the forgotten man at the bottom of the economic pyramid.” To Roosevelt, the “forgotten man” encompassed the industrial worker and struggling farmer and Keynesian consumer — ordinary citizens without whom a modern economy would falter. He built the New Deal around this image, establishing the minimum wage, Social Security and the federal right to organize unions. Those reforms cemented the loyalty of the white working class to the Democratic Party for a generation. But the New Deal also “forgot” — or excluded — many people, including African-Americans. When the Great Society came along, Lyndon Johnson tried to make up for that by expanding federal programs serving the poor and by championing the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts. As the country started to “remember” its long-delayed promises of equality, however, the “forgotten American” began to emerge as term of exclusion and resistance to change. “There is hardly a language to describe him, or even a set of social statistics,” Mr. Schrag wrote in his August 1969 essay, “ The Forgotten American .” “Just names: racist-bigot-redneck-ethnic-Irish-Italian-Pole-Hunkie-Yahoo. The lower middle class. A blank.” As Mr. Schrag noted, all of that name-calling was part of the problem, a refusal on the part of liberal elites to recognize the real grievances and desires of what had once been a bedrock Democratic constituency. In the 1968 campaign, Nixon capitalized on this resentment with calls for “law and order,” a phrase that evoked not only fears of crime, but also anger at protesters and rioters and the college-campus liberals who tolerated them. Mr. Trump put that phrase back into political circulation in 2016, a gesture of solidarity with the old ways of thinking about the “silent majority” — and the “forgotten American.” And though he included “men and women” in his victory speech, Mr. Trump’s campaign mobilized around the same image that once animated the Roosevelt coalition: the “forgotten” white working-class man. Race, too, remains an indelible part of today’s conversation about who has been “forgotten” and who deserves to be seen. To dismiss this language as simple racism, however, is to miss at least some of its political significance. What happened in the late 1960s and 1970s was not only that the Republican Party reclaimed and redefined Roosevelt’s “forgotten man” for a more conservative age. During those years, the Democratic Party itself began to turn away from the New Deal and its working-class politics, especially from its commitment to organized labor. With Mr. Trump’s election, we may be witnessing the rise of a new party system, with the Democrats now the standard-bearers of racial tolerance and free-market globalization, and the Republicans the party of nationalist populist revolt. But as Roosevelt showed, this need not be a fixed political equation. If the 2016 election marks the final, gasping end of the New Deal coalition, it should also mark the start of a new reckoning within the Democratic Party.  By  Helen Lewis  LONDON — You can’t throw a peanut in a Westminster pub without hitting an obsessive follower of American politics. Start a conversation about “The West Wing” with any member of Parliament and expect to get a long disquisition on that American political drama’s best episodes. During Britain’s last general election, in 2015, both main political parties here proudly boasted about being advised by veterans of Barack Obama’s campaign. Until now, our Americophilia has been unrequited. Then in August, Donald J. Trump declared himself “Mr. Brexit.” For Mr. Trump and his supporters, Britain’s vote in June to leave the European Union was evidence of a growing popular revolt against multiculturalism, porous borders and political elites. If the British electorate could deliver a result that baffled its financial sector, its scientists and metropolitan liberals – and was not widely predicted by pollsters – couldn’t the same sort of upset happen in America? It just did. Mr. Trump’s victory feels like a flashback to June, although where Brexit divided members of Britain’s political class, the American election results have united them. Politicians of the mainstream right and left alike are dumbfounded that the United States  would elect someone who uses the extreme language Mr. Trump does and who seems to have little love for institutions like NATO. Last December, Britain’s former Conservative prime minister, David Cameron, described Mr. Trump’s proposed ban on Muslims entering America as “divisive, stupid and wrong.” The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan of the Labour Party, has called the president-elect’s views on Islam “ignorant.” Apart from Nigel Farage, the face of the far-right U.K. Independence Party, it is difficult to find a British politician with a good word to say about Mr. Trump. Nationalism, white anger and protectionism are now driving politics in Britain and across Europe. The sound is of doors slamming. Brexit felt like a referendum on border control, and on rapid demographic change among white communities that felt themselves deprived of attention and resources. It is tempting to draw comparisons with the United States: The big cities in both Britain and the United States, which are most diverse, are also most relaxed about that diversity. In smaller communities, immigration feels more disruptive. There are other parallels. Mr. Trump’s victory was driven by older, white voters, who were struggling but not destitute. He won white men without college degrees by a landslide. A typical Leave supporter has a similar demographic profile. Such voters are on the decline, as both Britain and the United States become more diverse and younger generations are better-educated, and more open to immigration and change. But as both the Brexit vote and Mr. Trump’s victory showed, they are far from a spent force.  By  Susan Chira  Women, as Hillary Clinton showed this morning , know how to absorb pain. And Mrs. Clinton has had plenty of practice about how to stand before the cameras after public humiliation. Clearly, she needed time to compose herself. She made no appearances overnight, instead calling Donald J. Trump to concede. But when she strode onstage in purple and gray, Bill Clinton behind her in a purple tie, her voice did not waver. Women seldom have the luxury of giving in to pain. Many have children or grandchildren or aging parents to tend, whether they themselves are sick or in emotional turmoil. So Mrs. Clinton faced her despondent campaign staff and her despondent half of the country and tried to rally them. She spoke most directly to young people, and to women and girls. She had hoped to stand before them as a symbol of all that women could achieve. Now she had to demonstrate once again what women can endure. “I’ve had successes and setbacks, sometimes really painful ones,” she told them. It was hard not to recall her standing beside Bill Clinton after the whole world knew graphic and humiliating details about the affairs he had denied having. “To all the women and especially the young women who put their faith in me I want you to know that nothing has made me prouder than to be your champion,” she said, and here she had to clear her throat. “I know we still have not shattered that highest and hardest glass ceiling but some day somebody will, and hopefully sooner than we might think right now.” It’s difficult to know right now all that stood in the way of shattering that ceiling. Was it a woman, or this woman? Was it Mrs. Clinton as symbol of the Washington establishment, as a consummate insider in a time of profound distrust of the elite? We do know that voters disproportionately punish women who are seen as dishonest. We do know that it’s hard for strong, assertive and ambitious women to be seen as likable and competent at the same time. Political scientists and cultural commentators will long debate what happened in this election, to this woman and to many women.  The question is whether the image of Mrs. Clinton, composed and gracious in defeat, persevering through pain, will inspire women to try again?  By  Felix Salmon  Markets always move after seismic events, like the unexpected election of Donald J. Trump. Still, market moves need to be interpreted. Even if you believe that markets are right, it’s not always obvious what they’re saying. One way to think about the market’s gyrations is the idea of mean and variation. When Barack Obama (a.k.a. No Drama Obama) was elected president, it was possible to anticipate — correctly, it turned out — that he would help steer America back onto a course of steady growth, low inflation and falling unemployment. Think of that as the Obama mean: the baseline expectation. When the stock market expects good things like that, it tends to rise, just as it has during the Obama presidency. But the variation is just as important as the mean. Mr. Obama didn’t always give the markets what they wanted, but by the same token he was always clear about what he was going to do. He promised them something much more valuable: a low-risk upward economic trajectory. Mr. Trump is the exact opposite of Mr. Obama. His baseline is worse, for starters: to establish expectations for his presidency, you have to factor in his hugely irresponsible fiscal policy, potential trade wars and maybe even reckless brinkmanship over repaying the national debt. Put those things together, and a severe recession becomes possible. But it gets even worse because Mr. Trump is by his nature highly unpredictable. However bad you think he’s going to be, it’s entirely possible that your prediction will turn out to be ridiculously optimistic. Mr. Trump has vastly more downside risk than Mr. Obama ever had, and so markets are going to trade at a discount to his already-discounted baseline. If you transition, then, from low-risk positive expectations to high-risk negative expectations, you have to expect the markets to take some precipitous plunges along the way. Much of that will be noise. The markets always fluctuate randomly in the short term, and there’s no point in trying to read anything meaningful into those moves. That’s why it’s dangerous to read too much into midnight stock-market futures trading, or a sudden plunge in the value of the Mexican peso once it becomes obvious that Mr. Trump will become president. Those moves might be a rational response to the lower expected value of the assets in question. On the other hand, they might just be the result of panicky hedging — or indeed they could simply represent dealers second-guessing and trying to outmaneuver one another. Once the market has been trading steadily for a few months, its general direction under the auspices of the new government is going to be pretty clear. Fluctuations over just a few hours, by contrast, are much harder to read. They might look like signals — but all too often they turn out to be nothing but noise. And as we’ve learned during this long, brutal election, separating noise from signals can be a very tricky business.  By  Michael Lerner  It turns out that shaming the supporters of Donald J. Trump is not a good political strategy. Though job loss and economic stagnation played a role in his victory, so did shame. As the principal investigator on a study of the middle class for the National Institute of Mental Health, I found that working people’s stress is often intensified by shame at their failure to “make it” in what they are taught is a meritocratic American economy. The right has been very successful at persuading working people that they are vulnerable not because they themselves have failed, but because of the selfishness of some other villain (African-Americans, feminists, immigrants, Muslims, Jews, liberals, progressives; the list keeps growing). Instead of challenging this ideology of shame, the left has buttressed it by blaming white people as a whole for slavery, genocide of the Native Americans and a host of other sins, as though whiteness itself was something about which people ought to be ashamed. The rage many white working-class people feel in response is rooted in the sense that once again, as has happened to them throughout their lives, they are being misunderstood. So please understand what is happening here. Many Trump supporters very legitimately feel that it is they who have been facing an unfair reality. The upper 20 percent of income earners, many of them quite liberal and rightly committed to the defense of minorities and immigrants, also believe in the economic meritocracy and their own right to have so much more than those who are less fortunate. So while they may be progressive on issues of discrimination against the obvious victims of racism and sexism, they are blind to their own class privilege and to the hidden injuries of class that are internalized by much of the country as self-blame. The right’s ability to portray liberals as elitists is further strengthened by the phobia toward religion that prevails in the left. Many religious people are drawn by the teachings of their tradition to humane values and caring about the oppressed. Yet they often find that liberal culture is hostile to religion of any sort, believing it is irrational and filled with hate. People on the left rarely open themselves to the possibility that there could be a spiritual crisis in society that plays a role in the lives of many who feel misunderstood and denigrated by the fancy intellectuals and radical activists. The left needs to stop ignoring people’s inner pain and fear. The racism, sexism and xenophobia used by Mr. Trump to advance his candidacy does not reveal an inherent malice in the majority of Americans. If the left could abandon all this shaming, it could rebuild its political base by helping Americans see that much of people’s suffering is rooted in the hidden injuries of class and in the spiritual crisis that the global competitive marketplace generates. Democrats need to become as conscious and articulate about the suffering caused by classism as we are about other forms of suffering. We need to reach out to Trump voters in a spirit of empathy and contrition. Only then can we help working people understand that they do not live in a meritocracy, that their intuition that the system is rigged is correct (but it is not by those whom they had been taught to blame) and that their pain and rage is legitimate."
"Gulf Council Reaches Out to Morocco and Jordan","Advertisement By SARA HAMDAN MAY 25, 2011  DUBAI — Invitations to Jordan and Morocco this month to apply for membership in the Gulf Cooperation Council are aimed at strengthening the security of the monarchies in the Gulf, political analysts and diplomats say. “G.C.C. decision makers are inviting Jordan, a major country from the Arab East, and Morocco, another major country from North Africa, in order to give political and strategic depth to the G.C.C.,” said Mustafa Alani, director of the security department at the Gulf Research Center in Dubai. In Paris, the Bahraini ambassador to France, Nasser al-Belooshi, told journalists this month that Morocco and Jordan “are well respected in the world,” adding, “They have a weight globally, and it will help the G.C.C.” At the same time, Mr. Alani said, “Jordan and Morocco are different in terms of culture, economic profile, and even the type of monarchy found in G.C.C. states.” Given those differences, he said, “this decision seems to be based mainly on a new emerging Arab bloc with geographic expansion plans in mind.” Advertisement Since the uprisings began in December in the Arab world, in Tunisia, the Gulf states have been shifting their strategic and political alliances to adapt to changes in their basic security framework. Analysts say this is a response to both the internal threat of further unrest and the external threat from Iran. Advertisement Faced by this year’s groundswell of unrest, the Sunni monarchies of the G.C.C. — Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman and Qatar — have coordinated a mutual defense, using carrots, sticks and diplomacy. “The six-nation bloc is trying to bolster its defense,” said Ayesha Sabavala, a Middle East economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit, based in London. In mid-March, the council gave $20 billion in aid to Oman and Bahrain for housing and infrastructure improvements to appease protesters. Days later, troops from the Emirates and Saudi Arabia backed Bahrain’s military crackdown on Shiite demonstrators demanding economic and political reforms. Then, this month, came outreach to Jordan and Morocco — two pro-Western, Sunni monarchies with a common interest in containing Shiite Iran. The courting of Jordan is a sign of how much has changed in the region’s geopolitical arithmetic. While Morocco has never shown any particular interest in joining the Gulf club, Jordan applied twice, in the 1980s and in 1996, and was rejected, Mr. Alani said. Taufiq Rahim, a visiting fellow at the Dubai School of Government, said: “There is greater uncertainty in the region and a lot of shifting alliances. The nature of the Arab league is changing.” “Greater G.C.C. integration will lead to a more united front in terms of foreign policy in the region,” he added. Analysts say the turning point came when Saudi Arabia and its Gulf neighbors saw how the United States dealt with the fall of the Egyptian regime.

Shadi Hamid, director of research at the Brookings Doha Center and a fellow at the Saban Center for Middle East Policy in Washington, said: “The Saudis worried that if the U.S. was able to turn its back on one of its closest allies in the region when former President Hosni Mubarak left, will they do it again if unrest erupts somewhere else in the region? Who will they throw under the bus next?” Advertisement Mr. Hamid noted that Jordan and Morocco have been close to Washington. In 2007, Morocco signed a $697.5 million poverty reduction accord with the United States. Jordan is one of the highest per capita recipients of U.S. foreign aid, Mr. Hamid said, adding, “These two countries have been receiving a lot of money from the United States, and now Saudi Arabia wants to peel them off.” Mr. Hamid also points out that Jordan has one of the best-trained military and intelligence units in the region. Emile Hokayem, senior fellow for regional security at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Bahrain, added that the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia moved some police and army training facilities from Egypt to Jordan in mid-May. Ms. Sabavala, the economist, said, “The message is that the G.C.C. is looking to diversify its defense allies and perhaps reduce dependence on the West.” Meanwhile, membership in the Gulf group could bring Jordan and Morocco not just access to alternative aid flows, but also improved trade and employment opportunities — important benefits for countries facing big youth unemployed challenges, said Mhemet Biygautane, a research associate at the Dubai School of Government. In market-building terms, Jordanian and Moroccan accession to the G.C.C. would double the bloc’s total population, he added. Still, he and other analysts cautioned that there is no solid timeline in place for the two countries to join the club and that the precise scope of any membership deal has not been defined. “Is it a full membership with privileges of open borders and free movement of people and goods, or will it solely cover selected areas like security and trade?” Mr. Biygautane asked. “So far, we have not heard any specific hints from the G.C.C. regarding the terms of membership.” Celebrating its 30th anniversary this year, the G.C.C. was founded to foster economic integration among Gulf states. Yet plans for a G.C.C. customs union and common market, proposed in 2007, have made little progress, while the most recent of several target dates for a G.C.C. monetary union passed virtually unnoticed at the end of 2010. “We shouldn’t take for granted that this G.C.C. integration will definitely happen,” said Mr. Hokayem, the regional security specialist. “This is about putting Egypt, the U.S. and Iran on their toes and sending them a message.” Advertisement The invitation to Jordan and Morocco “makes it seem as if the G.C.C. is primarily a political or security body,” he added. “That’s fine, but it raises a lot of questions about common foreign policies for countries dealing with different regional and cultural issues.” A version of this article appears in print on May 26, 2011, in The International Herald Tribune.

"Arab League Votes to Suspend Syria Over Crackdown","Advertisement By NEIL MacFARQUHAR NOV. 12, 2011  CAIRO — The Arab League moved to suspend Syria ’s membership on Saturday, accusing the government of President Bashar al-Assad of defying an agreement to stop the violent repression of demonstrators, and it threatened economic and political sanctions if he did not comply. In acting against Syria, a core member of the Arab League, the group took another bold step beyond what had been a long tradition of avoiding controversy. Alarmed by the region-spanning upheaval of the Arab Spring demonstrations, league delegates said they were trying to head off another factional war like Libya’s, in which the group took the unprecedented step of approving international intervention. Syria’s formal suspension is to start in four days, offering what senior Arab League officials described as a last chance for Mr. Assad to carry out a peace agreement his government had accepted. The plan called for the Syrian government to halt the violence directed toward civilians, to withdraw all its security forces from civilian areas and to release tens of thousands of political prisoners. Throughout the meeting, the Syrian ambassador, Youssef Ahmed, kept shouting that the move was illegal because such a decision had to be unanimous, participants said. He later repeated the claim on state television and accused the league of being “subordinate to American and Western agendas.” Nabil el-Araby, the Arab League’s secretary general, pushed the initiative to a vote, with 18 of the league’s 22 members supporting the action, Yemen and Lebanon opposing, Iraq abstaining and Syria not voting at all. Advertisement “We are hoping for a daring move from Syria to halt the violence and to begin a real dialogue toward real reform,” said Sheik Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr al-Thani, the prime minister and foreign minister of Qatar, as well as the current league chairman. Advertisement Arab governments, seeking to reflect popular demand for democratic change, are trying to address the issue without prompting the violent downfall of the Syrian government or international military action, analysts said. “They all want to appear democratic, proactive and standing up for people because they are so embattled at home,” said Paul Salem, director of the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut, Lebanon. Previously, when the Arab League was more of a dictators’ club, cautious members like Egypt and Saudi Arabia put the brakes on any activism. But the uprisings appear to be rewriting that formula, with Qatar already buoyed by its success in pushing the envelope on Libya. “The Qataris, as is their wont, are getting out in front and pushing the agenda without anybody able to slow them down because the Syrians are still killing people,” Mr. Salem said. United Nations figures put the death toll at 3,500 since the uprising started in March, with more than 100 civilians killed since Syria accepted the Arab League plan on Nov. 2. President Obama praised the action on Saturday and promised to keep up pressure on Syria. “After the Assad regime flagrantly failed to keep its commitments, the Arab League has demonstrated leadership in its effort to end the crisis and hold the Syrian government accountable,” he said in a statement. When the league moved in March to approve international intervention to protect civilians in Libya, a step that led to NATO airstrikes, it was acting against a small, unpopular member of the organization. But Syria is a core member of the league, and the action on Saturday was surely a blow to Syria’s self-image as “the beating heart of Arabism.” Advertisement The organization was trying to walk a tightrope between bringing pressure to bear without bringing foreign military intervention, Sheik Hamad said. “Syria is a dear country to all of us, so it pains us to take this decision,” he said, adding, “We want to find a solution to the problem within an Arab framework.” Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter. You must select a newsletter to subscribe to. Diplomats involved said that Algeria was particularly outspoken in trying to give the Syrians even four more days to avoid repeating the Libyan example, but it was not alone. “They don’t want some sort of a blank check that is given to the Security Council to try to take this issue in hand,” said one Arab diplomat involved in the negotiations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of diplomatic concerns. “Some people are saying that if the regime comes under intense pressure from the Arab side, then they will make some changes.” Analysts said the move certainly set the stage for greater international intervention, including broader sanctions, without endorsing it immediately. Although the action on Saturday brings such a reckoning closer, the international opinion has been divided about Syria. The United Nations Security Council has been unable to agree on any actions other than issuing weak statements of condemnation. The Arab League resolution also says economic and political sanctions can be applied, though it did not specify any, and it called for Arab states still keeping ambassadors in Damascus, Syria’s capital, to withdraw them. The suspension and threatened sanctions come at a difficult time economically for Syria, with American, European and Turkish officials saying that they believe that the economy remains Mr. Assad’s greatest vulnerability. European diplomats say a European embargo on Syrian oil has devastated that sector, reducing oil production by as much as 75 percent. Syria’s oil exports represented anywhere from 15 to 35 percent of the state budget, and more than 90 percent of those exports went to Europe. The diplomats say that the Syrian government has not paid foreign oil companies since August, and that Chinese workers have recently begun leaving the oil fields north of Deir al-Zour for home. Sheik Hamad and other participants repeatedly emphasized that it was up to Syria to reverse the decision by carrying out the peace plan. Both frustration with Syria and personal animosity toward President Assad, particularly from Qatar’s leaders, helped drive the Arab League decision, participants said. The Arab League also called for a meeting of Syrian opposition leaders in Cairo in three days to forge some sort of consensus on negotiations with the Assad government. That, too, is an attempt to put added pressure on Syria, since up until now the opposition has been bitterly divided about whether to engage with the government. Advertisement Some opposition figures inside Syria worried about the repercussions of the Arab League’s decision. Louay Hussein, a prominent dissident in Damascus, said he thought the suspension would have little effect on Mr. Assad’s leadership itself. “The more the pressure increases from outside, the more the regime turns violent,” said Mr. Hussein, who has not aligned himself with the Syrian National Council, an opposition bloc based abroad. “The suspension won’t provide any positive result. The regime has one aim, controlling power, so suspending its membership is worthless.” In Damascus, a crowd reacted angrily to the resolution, attacking the Saudi Embassy, witnesses said. But outside the Arab League’s offices, near the heart of the Egyptian uprising in Cairo’s Tahrir Square, a group of about 100 protesters claiming common cause with Syrian demonstrators said they had hoped for more from the group: that it would call for President Assad to step down. Abdel Fattah al-Allawi, 23, who wore a Syrian flag draped over his shoulders as he protested, said he worried that the suspension might have the opposite of the desired effect. “They agreed last time to stop the killing,” he said, “and they killed even more people.” Anthony Shadid contributed reporting from Qatar, and Liam Stack from Cairo.

"Photos, Gardens, Birds, Trees: What’s Happening in the Great Outdoors","Advertisement Supported by Summer Reading By  Dominique Browning There’s a good deal of world’s-end whimpering in the air these days. May I suggest that we begin with a bang — even if it’s merely to journey into the great outdoors? “Bang!” went my heart when I opened the photographer Jack Spencer’s powerful THIS LAND: An American Portrait (University of Texas Press, $45) . There isn’t a garden in it — only the vestige of one, vines creeping up the side of a boarded-up cottage in Xenia, Ill., a sign of irrepressible life. As is the disheveled shrubbery lodged in a corner of Max Yasgur’s barn. (And if you have to ask, you didn’t join, in person or in spirit, that ancient odyssey to Woodstock.) This is a book that sets our sights high and fortifies our spirits, even if we merely journey into our own backyards. Spencer began driving across the United States with his camera after 9/11; over 13 years he logged 80,000 miles. The book’s epigraph from Wendell Berry best captures his motivation: to “grow humble before the place” that he might “arrive in his place and … want to remain.” Spencer’s work has a magisterial quality; some of it has the feel of photographic painting. Gaze in wonder at the striations of color in Death Valley, feel on your clothes the sopping California fog and on your face the weight of a cloud bank pressing against a lone tree on a South Dakota horizon. There are few people in these pictures, and most of them are, oddly, standing quietly in shallow water, cooling off in shimmering heat. But people have left their traces: in the otherworldly monumentality of a nuclear plant; in the ramshackle ruins of Bennett College in the Hudson Valley, an acid trip of melting architecture; in a youthful scrawl at the corner of a blackboard — Livie was here. And here we are still. We care enough, on occasion, to minister to our tiny corners of the earth. We don’t seem to care enough to stop the desecration of our larger home. “This Land” is both anthem, worthy of a grand cause (celebrating without sentimentality this gorgeous place we inhabit), and prayer. “To save the Earth,” Spencer writes, “cannot be left to the worst of us.” Many years ago, I read a description of the Japanese sculptor Fumio Asakura’s home in Tokyo. As I recall, he was being referred to as the “Rodin of Japan,” and he was determined to stave off the egotism that often accompanies fame. So he designed a garden around five boulders, representing the Confucian values known as “the Five Constants,” to ground his daily meditation: Justice. Benevolence. Integrity. Knowledge. Propriety. Just in time to help us understand how the Japanese achieve soul-stirring heights with such economical gestures, Marc Peter Keane gives us JAPANESE GARDEN NOTES: A Visual Guide to Elements and Design (Stone Bridge, $59.95) . I’ve spent hours poring over Keane’s past books; this one presents a distillation of his years of studying and creating gardens in both the United States and Japan. It’s an elegantly soulful interpretation of the essential elements of Japanese garden design. A Japanese garden, Keane says, is “a powerfully quiet place” in which human society and wild life are “understood to be one and the same.” No one but Keane would take pains to sketch in the concept of Ma , the space between objects, “the breath of the garden.” Even if you aren’t planning to build such a garden — though they have a lot to recommend them, since deer have not yet begun to munch on gravel — many of the principles Keane describes are relevant: placing paths off center to relax formality or creating depth by layering planes or harnessing the expressive strength of stone elements. In my next garden, I plan to include a chiriana , or dust pit. Originally holes in the ground for collecting debris, over time chiriana have taken on a symbolic quality, becoming places to glance at before entering a garden or room, so as to leave behind troubling thoughts and shed “the dust of the mind.” My fantasies of moving to Kyoto were in full bloom when I picked up an unusual and entertaining memoir by Leslie Buck. Years ago, she left her successful landscape business in Northern California to apprentice herself to some master gardeners in Japan. CUTTING BACK: My Apprenticeship in the Gardens of Kyoto (Timber Press, $24.95) opens with her anxiously pruning a tree in a “not very old” garden in Kyoto (“only 350 years,” as a co-worker whispers). In this memoir, Buck chronicles three long and difficult seasons. Her Japanese is weak, so she works in a dazed state of incomprehension; rarely does someone pause to interpret. Her bosses — donning pristine white gloves every day — just yell or are coldly silent. The hours are unrelenting, six days a week. She must wear her jikatabi, two-toed cloth slippers, even in the snow. Her ego suffers as she descends from being among the best of American tree pruners to the status of a beginner in Japan. Sexism abounds. She leaves behind a quasi-committed boyfriend — the only part of the story that feels forced. He might have been pruned. The dream of this adventure was one thing; what Buck experiences proves “tiresome, mundane and repetitive.” She suffers, complains and cries; she’s lonely and cold and sick. But she works harder than she ever has before. And she learns — about durability and resilience. She learns to prune trees exquisitely. Most of all, she learns that “an apprentice must … be the good student.” Not a bad lesson for any gardener. Trees take up a lot of our shelf space, and many give their lives in vain; lots of treacle is written about them. Occasionally, though, there are worthy additions to tree literature. THE HIDDEN LIFE OF TREES: What They Feel, How They Communicate — Discoveries From a Secret World (David Suzuki Institute/Greystone, $24.95), by Peter Wohlleben and translated from German by Jane Billinghurst, describes the underground carbon market of what the Canadian ecologist Suzanne Simard calls these “gentle, sessile creatures.” Trees bring out Wohlleben’s — and our — poetic nature. He describes how trees communicate using scent; how they experience pain, have memory and make family groups. Trees, he informs us, are able to identify marauding insects by their saliva. Wohlleben describes “fungi that operate like fiber-optic internet cables,” linking many species by sending chemical and electrical signals through fungal networks and root tips. When trees are thirsty, they begin to scream at an ultrasonic level. He makes a case for the interconnectedness of natural systems: Falling leaves near coastlines leach acids into the ocean, stimulating the growth of plankton, which in turn increases the yields of fish and oysters. Can we learn, he asks, to respect the trees enough to spare them “unnecessary suffering”? And might we learn to do the same for ourselves? The intriguing, and more intimate, WITNESS TREE: Seasons of Change With a Century-Old Oak (Bloomsbury, $27) , by Lynda V. Mapes, portrays trees as “scribes, diarists, historians.” They are “among our oldest journalists.” A reporter herself, covering environmental issues for The Seattle Times, Mapes sets out to tell the story of climate change through one tree. But that is, marvelously, the least of it. She finds her oak in the Harvard Forest in Massachusetts and spends a year with it, telling of the farm on which it grew, twisting up out of a stone wall, and drawing forth people devoted to befriending and studying trees. They are the tree’s interpreters. Bob Leverett, a former Air Force engineer and a “committed big-tree hunter,” arrives to take measurements and tells Mapes, “I need trees for my emotional stability and health.” He bemoans all we have lost in the destruction of ancient forests: “We have robbed a species of its dignity.” Mapes is a graceful writer. She describes “the quiet finesse” of a tree; “the fructifying funk” at the base of an oak; the “wand of time” that is a core sample drilled out to ascertain age; the “choring and the weariness” in the diary of a 19th-century farmer’s wife; a spider that has “rappelled gracefully” off her glasses. She is spending so much time with her tree that it’s becoming a part of her; she sheds it only when she goes indoors at night. As for the vexing (if not terrifying) prospect of global warming, there’s no question in any gardener or farmer or arborist’s mind: Leaf-out starts earlier than ever before and first frost comes later as average temperatures rise steadily across the land. This isn’t a matter of belief; it’s observable fact. With that change in rhythm, and a weather system on steroids, come a host of problems. As Mapes puts it: “Leaves don’t lie; frost isn’t running for office; frogs don’t fund-raise; pollinators don’t put out press releases.” The natural world is an unimpeachable witness, and we would be wise to heed its testimony. “We are not separate from nature,” Mapes writes, and in this she echoes what the artists and scientists and gardeners are telling us too. “We are of it, and in it, and we need an ethical framework to match.” These writers are steadfast in contemplating justice, benevolence, integrity and knowledge. Now for a little propriety. There are correct ways of doing things, ways that respect and honor others, including trees. You aren’t hoisting yourself up three stories to saw off a limb? Then you may be hiring someone to prune your trees — and either way, you should recognize proper technique, so you can help put an end to the savage butchery we see along suburban streets. Two books will protect your arboreal investment. THE TREE DOCTOR: A Guide to Tree Care and Maintenance (Firefly, paper, $19.95), by Daniel Prendergast and Erin Prendergast, offers a survey of all aspects of planting, caring, feeding and cutting. ESSENTIAL PRUNING TECHNIQUES: Trees, Shrubs, and Conifers (Timber Press, $49.95), by George E. Brown, revised and expanded by Tony Kirkham, walks any would-be arborist through a veritable dictionary of trees, from abelias to zenobias. It also tells us what not to prune. The Franklinia, for instance: “Leave it to do what it wants.” When we’re exhausted after our outdoor chores, beautiful pictures provide cheer. Someone, somewhere, is getting the results we struggle to achieve. That would be Jinny Blom, an English garden designer and author of THE THOUGHTFUL GARDENER (Jacqui Small, $50). Some might argue there’s no such thing; a garden will always make you feel dumb about something. But who cares, if your grounds look as blowzily romantic as hers? I first became aware of Blom’s work after seeing a sensitive restoration she did in Scotland, included here, around a magnificent lodge designed by Moshe Safdie. Blom is “unmoved by fashion” and acts on an instinctual connection to a place. She was working as a psychologist until she was 36, when, during a visit to the Spanish countryside, she felt mental gears unlocking and clicking into motion. She became a designer — of gardens, furniture and planters — working across Britain, France and Africa. She takes “the pulse of the land” and learns about plants specific to locales, weaving harmonious tapestries of colors. “Gardening,” she reminds us, “is a profound holistic experience.” I’m told that in Europe the holistic garden now includes bug hotels, which seem to be all the rage among the cognoscenti. With no effort on my part, my entire house becomes a bug stop every spring. But for the more discerning among butterflies, spiders, bees and creepy crawlers, only custom digs will do. On this side of the pond, we’re more obsessed with housing for the fairies. For years, I’ve spared your tender sensibilities, dear readers. Until now. Sally J. Smith’s creations are irresistibly, delightfully weird. FAIRY HOUSES: How to Create Whimsical Homes for Fairy Folk (Cool Springs, $30) may catch the fancy of even the most snobbish among us. I wouldn’t mind moving into a scaled-up “Bellflower House” myself; did a wee Frank Gehry get hold of the drawing pad? Ultimately, though, I’m with William Butler Yeats and would think twice about luring in the fairies. As he hints in “The Stolen Child,” they can be dangerous: “Come away, O human child! / To the waters and the wild / With a faery, hand in hand, / For the world’s more full of weeping than you can understand.” And while we’re with the small ones: The Canadian writer Kyo Maclear is the author of charming, offbeat children’s books — a literary genre with which I’m growing familiar as I stash slender treasures away for my grandchild, anticipating the time when he can resist eating them. With the quirky, imaginative BIRDS ART LIFE: A Year of Observation (Scribner, $25) — part memoir, part scrapbook, part meditation — Maclear has flown the coop. I perched with her, happily charmed, for hours. This is a wondrous little book about “being a little lost.” While she tends to her aging father, ill and frail, she accompanies an amateur bird-watcher for a year, simply for the pleasure of parsing out his love for the “imperfect and struggling.” In the course of learning to still her mind long enough to watch swans, finches and herons, she begins to ponder subjects like regret, roaming, waiting, smallness. She realizes that her sturdy marriage thrives on space, just as the pileated woodpecker needs woodlands in which to roam. When friends are arrested in Egypt, she reads about Rosa Luxemburg, imprisoned in 1916, “clinging to the birds.” Taking little trips into corners of Toronto with her binoculars, Maclear examines “the perverse audacity of someone aiming tiny.” Her research is “vigorous but useless,” she writes, though watching grebes she sees that most of us avoid lulls by filling them with “recognizable busyness.” Her book is full of drawings: of people with thick, expressive eyebrows; of humans and birds praised for their smallness; of writers and musicians who wander into detours. Birders might not have much in common, but they share a simple secret: “If you listen to birds, every day will have a song in it.” A stunning book of photographs of birds, TORI (Radius, $60) , arrives as a precious gift from Japan’s Yamamoto Masao. A hush hovers over these luminescent, silvery gray, blue-toned or sepia images; I found myself holding my breath as I turned the pages. Each small photograph is its own contained world, its own perfect object — and each one speaks eloquently of regrets, roaming, waiting, smallness. Or speaks of nothing but stillness. Elegiac or joyful? Is there a difference? Yamamoto seems to ask. Shed the dust of your mind; linger in these pages. There’s only the lightest touch of text, with excerpts from Seamus Heaney, Emily Dickinson and a few other poets — but in the end they’re all the words we need. The world is indeed full of weeping. And so much more. ♦ “I can’t count the number of times I’ve stopped on the sidewalk and thought, ‘What is that bird doing — and why?’ In ‘The Genius of Birds,’ Jennifer Ackerman answers these and other questions about the intelligence of birds with curiosity and wit. If you’re starting a new relationship with nature, this is the perfect first date.” — Amy Stewart Dominique Browning, the founder and director of Moms Clean Air Force, works at the Environmental Defense Fund.

"Robert Mugabe slates Tony Blair over Zimbabwe's land reform programme","The Zimbabwean president was charming and defiant on a state visit to South Africa, accusing the former PM of reneging on promises to fund redistribution by  David Smith in Pretoria  Wed 8 Apr 2015 18.24 BST   Last modified on Thu 8 Mar 2018 13.48 GMT   Robert Mugabe has launched a withering attack on Tony Blair over his handling of the country’s land reform programme, declaring: “Blair, Blair, who was he? Just the prime minister of Britain. I’m president of Zimbabwe.” The 91-year-old, who is on a rare state visit to South Africa , spoke off the cuff in a 35-minute monologue that varied from pointed to rambling to witty. His speech appeared to charm a room packed full of ministers and journalists, at times provoking outbursts of laughter. Mugabe has long accused Blair’s Labour government of reneging on promises of funding land redistribution in Zimbabwe made under the 1979 Lancaster House agreement. Critics, however, say it is an attempt to shift blame from his supporters’ violent seizures of white-owned farms that crippled the southern African nation’s economy . “We want peace, and peace does not mean you must have a lion’s share and others have a baboon’s share,” he told a press conference in the South African capital of Pretoria on Wednesday. “No, you are all together and let’s be equal. Inequality can breed other problems in the future. “We did not send away whites. We took away land in accordance with what the British and ourselves had agreed upon, Margaret Thatcher’s government. That commercial land reform programme, land shall be taken from the farmers and be given to the Zimbabweans. So, it was all constitutional. “If Blair’s England was no longer willing to pay for the land, should we have just folded our hands and said, ‘Oh, Lord almighty, I pray in the name of the father, the son and the holy ghost’? “Goodness me, no! Blair, Blair, who was he? Just the prime minister of Britain. I’m president of Zimbabwe . So that’s why we say ‘OK, it’s your money, keep it. It’s our land, we will take it.’ Balance.” One of Zimbabwe’s major farming exports is now tobacco, the president noted. “We don’t smoke much of it. The Chinese smoke most of it. My health minister advises against smoking, but he doesn’t advise against growing.” Mugabe, who has ruled Zimbabwe, formerly Rhodesia, since independence 35 years ago, has been condemned by human rights groups for orchestrating political violence and rigging elections, and remains under EU and US sanctions . Within Africa, however, his rehabilitation seemed complete as South Africa rolled out the red carpet for Mugabe and his wife Grace , greeting them with a brass band and 21-gun salute at the colonial-era Union Buildings. The South African president, Jacob Zuma, introduced him as a “dear brother”. The host was then reduced to a mere bit part as Mugabe put on a piece of political theatre reminiscent of a generation of post-independence African leaders who, irrespective of their personal moral standing, could deploy an easy charisma and informal manner seldom seen in today’s scripted, stage-managed era. He even parodied his notoriety as an autocrat. “Thank you for the publicity you have given me, those of you who have focused on me as a real dictator,” the former guerrilla fighter said wryly, eliciting mirth. “A dictator who never cut the throat of Ian Smith [the former prime minister of Rhodesia] the first time he came. “But I said no, let us turn our swords into ploughshares and forget about history. We worked together with Ian Smith. We allowed him even to have his farm and his father’s farm. The lord almighty called him, the doctors couldn’t help him, he died a natural death. “We had vowed that those who were guilty of apartheid and guilty of bombing our people, killing our people callously and throwing bodies into disused mines, would not get away with it. The moment we get home and we have power, we will cut off their heads. That is the anger you have when you are waging the struggle.” But when freedom came, Mugabe added, he had taken a similar approach to Nelson Mandela and preached racial reconciliation. Winding up his ruminations, Mugabe told the gathering: “Thank you for your listening to me. I can go on and on. That’s the gift of politicians, never to stop speaking until the people say ‘yah, we are tired’. And you are now tired, I see.” This prompted more laughter and applause. The world’s oldest leader left the stage, one hand clasping Zuma’s, the other raised in a fist. “ Amandla [power]!” he cried, playing to the gallery to the last."
"Execution of eight Arkansas inmates can go ahead, supreme court rules","Lethal injection ruling allows new execution dates to be set but one of the drugs needed expires in just seven days Associated Press  Fri 24 Jun 2016 05.31 BST   Last modified on Fri 14 Jul 2017 20.10 BST   Arkansas can execute eight death-row inmates, a split state supreme court ruled on Thursday in upholding a state law that keeps information about its lethal injection drugs confidential. However, the state has only seven days before one of the drugs needed for the three-drug protocol expires, and it isn’t clear when Arkansas will be able to resume its first executions since 2005. Arkansas’ attorney general, Leslie Rutledge, said she would request new execution dates once the stays were lifted on the eight inmate executions. For the stays to be lifted before the drugs expire, Rutledge must ask the court to expedite the certification process, one which usually puts the ruling into effect 18 days after it is issued. “I will notify the governor once the stays of executions have been lifted so that he may set execution dates. I know that victims’ families want to see justice carried out, and that is exactly what I will continue to work toward as attorney general,” she wrote in an emailed statement. If no request to speed up the certification timetable happens, the decision becomes final on 11 July. A paralytic drug, vecuronium bromide, expires on 30 June, and the supplier has said it will not sell the state more. A group of death-row inmates had argued that Arkansas’ execution secrecy law, which requires the state to conceal the maker, seller and other information about the drugs, could lead to cruel and unusual punishment and that the state reneged on a pledge to share information. But the high court said in its four-three majority opinion that a lower court “erred in ruling that public access to the identity of the supplier of the three drugs [that the Arkansas Department of Correction] has obtained would positively enhance the functioning of executions in Arkansas. As has been well documented, disclosing the information is actually detrimental to the process.” Jeff Rosenzweig, an attorney representing the inmates, said he was disappointed by the court’s ruling. “We are studying the decision and anticipate filing a petition for rehearing,” he said. Three justices wrote full or partial dissents, including Associate Justice Robin Wynne, who wrote that he believed the inmates proved their claim that the law violated the state constitution’s prohibition on cruel or unusual punishment and that the secrecy requirements were unconstitutional. Justice Josephine Linker Hart wrote that the dismissal of the complaint was premature and that she would have ordered disclosure of the drug information. In asking for the high court to overturn Pulaski county circuit court judge Wendell Griffen’s December ruling that the secrecy provisions of the execution law were unconstitutional, attorneys for the state said at least five other courts have ruled that the three drugs used in Arkansas’ protocol were acceptable, including the sedative midazolam. The US supreme court upheld Oklahoma’s use of midazolam last year. Arkansas Department of Correction spokesman Solomon Graves would neither comment on the ruling nor say whether the agency would try to move forward with the executions. Rutledge said the decision protected drug manufacturers “from intimidation and harassment”. For more than 10 years, Arkansas’ executions have been stalled because of multiple court challenges over different drug protocols and problems obtaining those drugs. Arkansas governor Asa Hutchinson set execution dates last September that were later stayed by the high court until the inmates’ challenge could be heard. Hutchinson “believes Judge Griffen overstepped his authority and is pleased the Arkansas supreme court reversed his ruling upholding the law protecting the confidentiality of the supplier,” spokesman J R Davis said, adding that Hutchinson was reviewing the decision and talking with Rutledge regarding “the appropriate next steps to take”. The inmates had argued that without disclosure of the source and other information they had no way to determine whether the midazolam, vecuronium bromide or potassium chloride would lead to cruel and unusual punishment. The inmates also argued that the secrecy law violated a settlement in an earlier lawsuit that guaranteed inmates would be given the information. The state has said that agreement was not a binding contract, and the court agreed on Thursday. Several other issues remain before the state can complete the eight pending executions in the seven days before the paralytic drug expires. A handful of the inmates have not been given a chance to have clemency hearings, and for those who already had them, it was unclear on Thursday whether they would be required to be given another opportunity to apply for clemency because a new date of execution would have to be set."
"","Advertisement  By  The New York Times  How the election and Donald Trump’s victory looks to Opinion writers.  By  Kevin Baker  Hope began to drain away slowly as the votes piled up after 8 o’clock, building small but definitive margins for Donald J. Trump in one swing state after another. Florida, North Carolina and Ohio turned his way, taking the assumptions of a generation with them. Democratic hopes of retaking the Senate were quickly annihilated.  When Virginia, Pennsylvania and especially Michigan began to turn red, too, there was visible shock on many of the faces around our living room. We were, for the most part, just the sorts of rootless cosmopolitans that Mr. Trump’s supporters most thoroughly despise: Americans who also have citizenship in France and England, a woman whose family fled the mullahs when they came to power in Iran. A schoolteacher whose family emigrated from Mexico a generation ago. All day long we had listened to the latest polls and surveys, and told ourselves that it still could not possibly happen — that the other America we had always dreaded, and always feared was out there, could not possibly prevail in the end.  Mrs. Clinton seemed to be winning, if narrowly, in almost all the swing states, and hey, maybe there was a hidden Clinton majority lurking somewhere. Now it appears clear that Trumpland was even more impenetrable to us than we thought — even to our most able opinion seekers.  Instead, the Republican pundit Steve Schmidt had it right on MSNBC:  “The people who are for Trump are not embarrassed to be for Trump.  This is a fiction of the New York City, Acela-corridor imagination, who are embarrassed for these people. This is part of the condescension.” Certainly, they have a great deal to be angry about, and a great deal that Hillary Clinton and her husband ignored, and have ignored for almost a quarter-century now. They destroyed the old Democratic Party of liberal economics, and replaced it with nothing but a hope and a promise too far for much of the country to ever attain. The trouble is that this new, American version of the disinherited has squandered their voice on a dyspeptic scream, a retro turn to racism and sexism, without anything resembling a plan, or a new vision for America. I would dispute only Mr. Schmidt’s silly assertion that this was a deserved response to our “condescension.” Far from condescending to anyone, everyone I knew was mostly hoping desperately that Mr. Trump’s voters could not possibly hate the rest of us so completely that they would vote in droves for the most irresponsible and openly bigoted candidate ever to gain a major-party nomination. A friend called to say that this is what it felt like in Britain, as Brexit was going down. We are in uncharted territory now, a place where there are no directions or guidelines.  A president who has close and perhaps undisclosed ties to a powerful foreign dictator and American enemy?  A president with absolutely no public-sector experience?  A cabinet to be filled with an array of characters more bizarre than your average Batman villains?  A far-right Supreme Court for the next generation? Our little gathering broke up in confusion, with more than one of our guests wondering if they would actually have to move. It’s something that I, as a native-born, white male — some of whose family were probably in this country circa 1620 — will have to consider, too, if my wife and I are to have any form of health care before we reach Medicare (assuming that Medicare will still be there, either).  These are words I never thought I would have to write. This has indeed been a campaign full of surprises, and I fear it will take away all our words for good.  By  Daniel K. Williams  Donald J. Trump was elected with a higher percentage of the white evangelical vote than any other Republican presidential candidate has ever received, and he has received strong support from prominent Christian Right leaders. Yet if Mr. Trump delivers on his promises, he will not give the religious right what its leaders have traditionally demanded or what the Republican Party platform calls for. Indeed, he will give them very little national legislation at all, but will instead offer them maximum latitude to pursue their agenda at the state level — a shift that may portend a potential breakthrough in the nation’s polarizing culture wars. National legislation has long been the goal of the religious right. When the movement emerged in the late 1970s, evangelical leaders such as Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson sought federal constitutional amendments to ban abortion and restore school prayer, because they wanted to reverse what liberal rights activists had done at the national level through the Supreme Court. In the early 21st century, leaders such as James Dobson continued this trend by persuading   President George W. Bush to endorse a constitutional amendment proposal to define marriage as exclusively heterosexual. In recent years, evangelicals have become so concerned about protecting their own religious liberty against federal mandates or court decisions that they have given less attention to imposing a moral agenda on the rest of the nation. Although the Republican Party platform continues to promise a constitutional amendment protecting human life from the moment of conception, the pro-life movement has not made any serious attempts to pass that amendment since the 1980s. Nor has there been much talk in the last decade of a national ban on same-sex marriage. Mr. Trump is well positioned to promote a further shift away from national moral regulation. For much of his adult life, he held culturally libertarian views on abortion and gay rights, and he evinced little interest in the religious right’s agenda. Early in his campaign, he expressed discomfort with conservative evangelicals’ opposition to the rights of transgender people to use the public restroom of their choice. But he quickly came to embrace a “states’ rights” position on same-sex marriage and transgender rights, a position that would allow culturally liberal New Yorkers the right to pursue different policies than cultural conservatives in Mississippi or North Dakota. And while Mr. Trump stumbled over abortion during his campaign, the policy that he ultimately reverted to was to leave abortion legalization up to the states — an outcome that he would try to ensure by nominating conservative Supreme Court justices who might overturn Roe v. Wade. Mr. Trump has gone further than any previous Republican presidential nominee in a generation in insisting that the religious right should enact its agenda at the state, rather than federal, level.  Although this was the policy position of many Republicans during the 1970s (including President Gerald Ford), religious right activists persuaded the G.O.P. in the early 1980s to abandon its states-rights approach to abortion and other social issues, and promise national legislation to implement the religious right’s agenda. Mr. Trump is leading the party back to its more traditional stance. While many liberals will find this outcome unsatisfactory — since it offers them no opportunity to secure national protection for individual rights that they consider inalienable — it may be the only compromise solution that can give both conservatives and liberals the freedom to pursue their own agenda at the local level without fear of a national backlash. If a socially libertarian New Yorker can deliver this compromise to the conservative white rural evangelical voters who put him in office, both conservatives and liberals should see that for what it is: a landmark opportunity to move beyond the culture wars.  By  Marwan Bishara  Just when the people of the Middle East thought things couldn’t get any worse, Donald J. Trump is elected president of the United States. Now, their apprehension about the president-elect dwarfs their disappointment with President Obama. It could be a blessing in disguise. America, in one magic moment, you’ve revealed how you’ve changed. For the worse. Poor you, you feel so insecure, vulnerable and fragile. Like the rest of us. So, instead of reaching for your famed “can-do” spirit, lifting yourselves up by the bootstraps, you turned to a strident, bellicose type of nationalism. The kind usually associated with strutting generalissimos of Third World nations with their chests covered with made-up, self-awarded medals. Maybe the people of the Middle East will look and realize that you are no longer the Great Democracy to emulate. That your modern style of empire and your role as keeper of the world order for the world’s own good are stumbling and failing, even in your own eyes; and that we in the Middle East should not be turning to you for rescue. For as long as I can remember, you’ve been on a self-assigned mission to change the Middle East. Indeed, the world. Now, it seems as if the change has flowed the other way. You’ve voted to reduce your liberties. To narrow the range of people entitled to justice and equality before the law. To live in a place where the police should not be criticized; where fighting political correctness is more important than fighting racism; where Muslims are suspected and people who appear Hispanic can be rounded up if they’re not carrying their papers. In this election you’ve revealed that your people — like Russians, Hungarians, Iraqis, Iranians and others whose politics you normally look down on — will choose a narrow, nonsensical nationalist ethos when they feel threatened by uncertainty. Your imperial outreach allowed you to experience other cultures, but now you’ve chosen to shrink your outlook, with the expectation that the world will continue to revolve around you. It won’t. Like the rest of us, you’re now divided between those who want to make their nation great again alone and those who want to make it great together. O.K., enough about you; let’s talk about us. We in the Middle East can’t decipher what exactly your incoming president wants from us. I don’t think he knows, either. Mr. Trump said he would bring back torture and ban Muslims from entering America, and he compared the threat of “radical Islam” to Soviet Communism. He wants less engagement in the region, and fewer “free riders” like the Saudis who don’t pay enough for American protection. And he wants the United States to abandon the costly nation-building in the Middle East. What nation-building? In Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Yemen, Libya and Somalia, civil wars continue unabated. The Arab and Muslim worlds only hope the United States stops contributing to the destruction.
Mr. Trump does not exactly seem concerned for the wishes of Middle Easterners and their right to live in peace. It sounds more like what he really wants to do is pal around with other strutting, authoritarian types. Expect him to cozy up to Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, and join him in supporting Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad. Expect America’s new president to work closely with Egypt’s president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, and Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. Mr. Trump has embraced Mr. Netanyahu’s positions on Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and on abandoning the two-state solution. Instead of Americanizing the Middle East, Mr. Trump seems set on “Israelizing” America, stirring fear of Muslims and trying to wall out “the other.” Arabs, and Middle Easterners in general, should take one quick look and figure out how to be less dependent on the United States, and how to resolve their conflicts within their own, regional frameworks.
Finally, some good news. President Obama has assured us that the sun will rise tomorrow, regardless. And if the Trump presidency is as bad as I expect it to be — though not so bad that it demolishes democracy entirely — he can be voted out in four years. Meanwhile, fasten your seatbelts. It’s going to be a hell of a ride.  By  Carol Giacomo  A commitment to human rights has been a fundamental precept of NATO since the alliance was created a half century ago. You would not expect that a founding member would have to be reminded of that fact. Certainly not the United States, for all those years the leader of NATO and an inspirational embodiment of its core values. Yet this is where we find ourselves now, the day after Donald Trump won the presidency: In congratulating him on his victory, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany felt compelled to set conditions for cooperation. “Germany and America are connected by values of democracy, freedom and respect for the law and the dignity of man, independent of origin, skin color, religion, gender, sexual orientation or political views,” she said in a statement, adding: “I offer the next President of the United States close cooperation on the basis of these values.” Mr. Trump’s behavior during his campaign was antithetical to those values. He has threatened to ban Muslims from the United States, refuse refugees, deport 11 million undocumented workers and build a wall on the border with Mexico. He has disparaged African Americans, Mexican Americans, women and people with disabilities. Moreover, Mr. Trump has called into question America’s commitment to NATO and displayed a befuddling penchant for defending Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, who is waging war in eastern Ukraine and destabilizing other parts of Europe by supporting far-right groups. He received no pushback on Wednesday from Theresa May, the British prime minister, who simply congratulated Mr. Trump on his win. The two leaders’ reactions were further proof that, after Britain’s decision to leave the European Union, we will have to look to Mrs. Merkel not just to lead Europe but to replace America in leading NATO as well.  By  Gil Troy  “I am scared that if Ronald Reagan gets into office, we are going to see more of the Ku Klux Klan and a resurgence of the Nazi Party,” Coretta Scott King said in November, 1980. “I’m afraid things are going to blow sky high during this next term,” a nursing student said. He’s a “nitwit,” added a Democrat. “He’s shallow, superficial and frightening,” one of that year’s historic numbers of “undecideds” insisted. Ronald Reagan “seems not to relish complexity and subtlety,” the New York Times editorial endorsing President Jimmy Carter’s re-election proclaimed. “The problem is not a loose lip but the simple answer.”  While fearing what Reagan’s own running mate, George H.W. Bush, had dismissed as Reagan’s “voodoo economics” during their primary fight, the editorial board feared “voodoo diplomacy,” too. From coast to coast, half of a divided nation abhorred —  and underestimated — the president-elect. “The American people,“ Hamilton Jordan, a key Carter aide, said, "are not going to elect a 70-year-old, right-wing, ex-movie actor to be president.” Pollsters reported in 1980 that “More voters held negative attitudes toward each presidential candidate than in any campaign since polling began” — a record we just broke in 2016. The economic dislocation of galloping inflation and the energy crisis produced a nasty campaign. Feeling neglected by Washington, millions embraced Ronald Reagan’s populism. Despite the Democratic panic, Ronald Reagan left America richer and safer after two terms as president. Reagan defied expectations by turning toward the center. He acted as president of the United States, not president of the Republican Party. Reagan used the transition period to heal wounds while claiming a broad policy mandate, despite winning only 50.7 percent of the popular vote. He vowed to “rebuild a bipartisan base for American foreign policy.” His cabinet choices were so moderate that Pat Buchanan, the conservative flamethrower whose rhetorical bluster anticipated the advent of Donald Trump, lamented: “Where is the dash, color, and controversy — the customary concomitants of a Reagan campaign?” Just weeks into Reagan’s first term, conservatives were demanding that his aides had to “Let Reagan be Reagan,” meaning: stop being so reasonable. But in adjusting, in tempering, Reagan was being Reagan. He knew the Constitution limited presidential powers — and he faced a Democratic Congress led by the formidable speaker of the House Tip O’Neill to remind him further. Illustrating Richard Neustadt’s lesson that the power of the president is mostly “the power to persuade,” many of Reagan’s achievements were symbolic. Rather than shrinking government as he promised, for example, he only lowered the federal government’s growth rate. History is not destiny. And Reagan had both a lighter touch than Mr. Trump, and eight years’ experience as  governor of California. Still, history is full of shifts and surprises. Mr. Trump must be a healer and unite America, as he tried doing in his victory speech. If he fails, the checks and balances that sometimes help crusading ideologues become effective leaders can ultimately impose a necessary gridlock. When asked about conservatives’ frustration with him, Reagan kindly insisted it was only a “very few” critics. He said: “There are some people who think that you should, on principle, jump off the cliff with the flag flying if you can’t get everything you want.” Reagan recalled that “If I found when I was governor that I could not get 100 percent of what I asked for, I took 80 percent.” So far, Mr. Trump, the political amateur and sputtering demagogue, has lacked Reagan’s magnanimity or his flexibility. Can the reality-show star turned president-elect mimic the actor turned president?  By  James R. Jones  In 1968, there was a demand among voters for change, especially regarding Vietnam and foreign policy, and there was a backlash against some of the Great Society programs. Then, as now, the Democratic candidate was tied to the departing administration and hamstrung to differentiate a new set of policies. As a result, the Democratic presidential nominee, Hubert H. Humphrey, narrowly lost to the Republican, Richard M. Nixon, a candidate who was despised by a large percentage of the electorate. One positive outcome of that election was the first organized transition from the departing to incoming governments. President Lyndon B. Johnson always believed that, after an election, Democrats and Republicans should come together to do what’s right for the country. At the time, I was President Johnson’s appointments secretary, the position that has since evolved into the White House chief of staff. Right after the 1968 results came in, the president put me in charge of organizing a transition process, something that had never been done. “Nixon is an S.O.B., but he’s the only president we’ll have,” Johnson told me. “I want him and all of his team to be fully prepared to govern after the Inauguration at 12 noon on January 20.” A few days later, Johnson and Nixon met at the White House along with Nixon’s top advisers, including H. R. Haldeman and John Mitchell. There we mapped out a program in which all of the Johnson cabinet and major White House staff members would brief their incoming counterparts as often as was desired by the new administration. My charge was to work with Haldeman, who became my successor at the White House, to make sure these briefings occurred across the new administration and in a timely fashion. One surprise was that Nixon told me that Mitchell could speak for him in all matters if he was not available. Johnson would have never delegated such authority, but that was the difference in the management style of the two men. While a smooth transition was important to Johnson, he didn’t stop being president. He was issuing orders and making appointments right up to the morning of the Inauguration. In fact, the day before the Inauguration the president told me to find out how many vacancies existed on commissions and boards and find good people that he could nominate. He kept Nixon waiting in the Blue Room on Inauguration morning while he signed those nominations (which required Senate confirmation) and had them delivered to the Congress before noon. It is a positive sign that President Obama invited Donald J. Trump to meet at the White House two days after this most contentious election. Today transitions are much more institutional now than our first one in 1968. But this process can heal many wounds and start bringing our country closer together. That’s imperative if we want to make our government work for the people again. Back in 1968, Johnson and Nixon left the White House together, along with Senator Everett Dirksen and me. We jumped into the car and headed to the Capitol. Surprisingly, Nixon wanted only to discuss how disappointed he was to have lost Texas (Johnson’s home state) and how determined he was to win it in1972. I hope the ride to the Capitol next January will be more substantive on policy.  By  Sarah Jaffe  If anything has been made clear by the results of this election, it is that the political and pundit class have underestimated the degree of anger and pain in the United States, the degree to which “recovery” has been recovery for a few and stagnation and decline for many more. One exit poll has been haunting me since I saw it: The Reuters/Ipsos early exit poll found that 75 percent of respondents agreed “America needs a strong leader to take the country back from the rich and powerful.” Only slightly fewer agreed that “the American economy is rigged to advantage the rich and powerful,” and — perhaps the kicker — 68 percent believed that “traditional parties and politicians don’t care about people like me.” There’s a lot to unpack in those statements. They may conceal white resentment of the perceived advancement past them of black and Latino people. But they also reveal the sentiment that has been there since the 2008 financial crisis laid bare the lines of power in the country and the world — when, as the protest chant went, “Banks got bailed out, we got sold out.” The downward trends have been with us for decades: the divergence of productivity gains from workers’ incomes, the substitution of credit card debt for raises, the shift of good union jobs and family wages and pensions into low-wage service jobs, and the attendant slashing of the social safety net. But the past eight years sped all that up and made it impossible to ignore. If Donald J. Trump stood out to voters from the rest of the Republican Party, aside from a willingness to say directly the kinds of things usually carefully dogwhistled, it was in his rants about trade and his lack of interest in dismantling the remnants of the welfare state. For white Americans anxiously looking at their disappearing stability, Mr. Trump was a bomb they were willing to throw at a system they felt was failing them. He emotionally echoed their outrage and gave them a place to direct their anger, the age-old right-wing populist trick of refracting it both upward at elites and downward at minorities. Hillary Clinton’s campaign and the mainstream Democratic Party were woefully unprepared to greet this wave. When your response to a cry of “Make America Great Again!” is “America Is Already Great!” you’d better be sure that it feels true to a majority of voters. The results show that it did not. To be sure, Democrats had an uneasy line to walk, between maintaining continuity with a still-popular, twice-elected Barack Obama — a continuity that won Mrs. Clinton the Democratic primary — and reaching the people who wanted and needed change. But the party’s wholehearted backing of Mrs. Clinton was a colossal misreading of a moment when rage at the establishment (of both parties) was simmering everywhere. That rage should have been visible as Mr. Trump ran away with the Republican nomination process despite the opposition of that party’s grandees, and as Bernie Sanders pushed Mrs. Clinton much harder than anyone had expected a gray-haired socialist from Vermont to do. But Mrs. Clinton opened her arms to disaffected Republicans rather than wooing the disaffected within and around her own party. Most of the television ads she ran were more about painting Trump as a dangerous aberration, an outsider unfit for office, than pitching any plan of her own for change. Democrats failed to realize that for many Trump voters, that was exactly what they liked about him.  By  Will Wilkinson  It may not be an exaggeration to say that Donald Trump both knows and cares less about the details of public policy than anyone ever elected president of the United States. This just goes to show that “politics is not about policy,” as Robin Hanson, the futurist and social theorist, likes to say. Mr. Trump’s playbook against Hillary Clinton broke with the hard-won norms of liberal democracy, went back to demagogic, authoritarian political basics, and updated them for  the reality television, social media age. Politics is, at bottom, about factions vying and coordinating to choose leaders in whom to invest authority. Throughout the campaign, Mr. Trump displayed an uncanny and unnerving mastery of the primal politics of authority, and the game of legitimizing his own and delegitimizing his rivals’ claims to authority. In Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump drew a general election opponent pre-weakened by a decades-long Republican campaign of delegitimization. He took advantage of it with shameless audacity, making the most of our culture’s lingering sexism and the popular perception of Mrs. Clinton as a member of an arrogant and corrupt elite that believes it is above the law. But tearing down his opponents was only half of Trump’s equation. The pundits and pollsters so badly botched their predictions in no small part because they failed to grasp the intense, reality-distorting power of Donald Trump’s fame. But Mr. Trump seems to have an intuitive understanding that glamour, celebrity and gaudy wealth are key ingredients in majesty — which is inherently authoritative and underwrites its own claim to legitimacy. Trump’s self-branded personal jet was more than a convenient means of transportation for a very rich man. It was a purple silk, ermine-fringed cape, Air Force One in waiting, and he knew how to use it. The United States, the world’s first nation founded on principled opposition to the pre-Enlightenment politics of majesty and unified authority, has deep-seated norms of republican modesty and propriety. Casting those norms aside and banking heavily on the atavistic political appeal of majestic celebrity gave Mr. Trump an advantage few us were prepared to acknowledge, allowing him to attract the support of an unforeseen numbers of black, Hispanic and female voters, despite his campaign’s naked racism and his scandalously misogynistic and abusive personal history. Because Mr. Trump’s strategy was so indifferent to matters of policy substance, it is incredibly difficult to say what policies Mr. Trump will actually support in office. I don’t think we’ve ever known less about what an incoming president really wants to do with his power. But we do have a clear indication of how he’s likely to wield it. He will cleverly burnish his claim to authority and relentlessly and effectively discredit his opponents, inside and outside the Republican Party, with all the tools of an executive branch that has never been more powerful and less constrained by the constitutional system America’s founders designed specifically as an alternative to and a bulwark against unitary authority.  By  Lindy West  I got up on Election Day and burst into tears — not a genteel twin trickle but a great heaving burst, zero to firehose. Tears spattered the inside of my glasses, dripped from my lips, and left mascara-tinged rosettes blooming black in my cereal milk. “Honey,” my husband crooned to me. “Honey, it’s going to be O.K. The numbers are still good. It’s O.K.” But it wasn’t the numbers. I wasn’t sobbing because I was afraid Hillary Clinton was going to lose. That would come later. I was sobbing Tuesday morning because, as I poured my coffee, I’d caught a glimpse of a cable news interview with Mrs. Clinton just after she voted for herself in Chappaqua, N.Y. She seemed breathless, exhilarated, a little overwhelmed. Over her shoulder, Bill Clinton stared at his wife and beamed. My husband stares at me like that sometimes. It’s not just love — we expect husbands to love their wives — but something less traditional, more conditional and gendered. It’s professional respect. It’s pride. We’re accustomed to that pride flowing the other direction, from wife to husband, because men in our culture get to be more than just bodies, do more than just nurture. Men get to act and excel and climb and aspire and thrive and win and rule and be the audacious, hungry fulcrum of public life. It is normal for men to have ambition. It is normal for women to stand aside. I thought about Bill Clinton meeting Hillary Rodham at Yale in 1971, and how tenacious and intense she must have been even back then, how undeniable and potent. Mr. Clinton describes the moment in his memoir . “She conveyed a sense of strength and self-possession I had rarely seen in anyone, man or woman,“ he wrote. "She was in my face from the start.” He says he once told her , during those years, “I have met all the most gifted people in our generation and you’re the best.” And then I thought about Mr. Clinton rising steadily through his political career, on the track we have built for charismatic, competent white men. He must have known, every second, how good his wife was. Not just good, but “the best.” Better than everyone he’d ever met; better than him, even. And he watched her stand next to him and wait, and wait, and wait, underestimated and degraded and excoriated for wanting more out of life than cookies. And she didn’t quit! She swallowed slander and humiliation and irrational hatred for three decades and she didn’t quit, and here she was, just a hair’s breadth from the presidency of the United States — the first woman ever to be trusted with the rudder of the world. He must be so proud of her, I thought. It made me cry. I cried because I want my daughters to feel that blazing pride, that affirmation of their boundless capacity — not from their husbands, but from their world, from the atmosphere, from inviolable wells of certainty inside themselves. I cried because it’s not fair, and I’m so tired, and every woman I know is so tired. I cried because I don’t even know what it feels like to be taken seriously — not fully, not in that whole, unequivocal, confident way that’s native to handshakes between men. I cried because it does things to you to always come second. Whatever your personal opinion of the Clintons, as politicians or as human beings, that dynamic is real. We, as a culture, do not take women seriously on a profound level. We do not believe women. We do not trust women. We do not like women. I understand that many men cannot see it, and plenty more do not care. I know that many men will read this and laugh, or become defensive, or call me hysterical, or worse, and that’s fine. I am used to it. It doesn’t make me wrong. But maybe this election was the beginning of something new, I thought. Not the death of sexism, but the birth of a world in which women’s inferiority isn’t a given. That grain of hope glowed inside me until around dinner time on Tuesday, the final day of an election so openly misogynist that the question “Sexual assault: good or bad?” was credulously presented for debate. Today doesn’t feel real. It is indistinguishable from fresh, close grief. But if there’s one lesson we can take from Mrs. Clinton, politics aside — and even Donald Trump acknowledged it in the second debate — it’s the limitlessness of human endurance. Those of us who have been left in the cold by this apparent affirmation of a white supremacist patriarchy (and sorry, white women who voted for Mr. Trump, but your shelter is illusory) are tough. We have been weathering this hurricane wall of doubt and violence for so long, and now, more crystalline than ever, we have an enemy and a mandate. We have the smirking apotheosis of our oppression sliming, paw-first, toward our genitals. We have the popular vote. We have proof, in exit polls, that white women will pawn their humanity for the safety of white supremacy. We have abortion pills to stockpile and neighbors to protect and children to teach. We have the right woman to find. We have local elections in a year. The fact that we lost doesn’t make us wrong; the fact that they don’t believe in us doesn’t make us disappear.  By  Seth Grossman  A couple of years ago, I produced a reality-TV show called “Hollywood Hillbillies,” about a family from rural Georgia who, driven by the grandson’s newfound internet fame, moves west to make it in Hollywood. The show centered on the undeniable charisma of “Mema,” the foul-mouthed matriarch who spoke her mind and poked fun at the habits and attitudes of the Los Angeles elite. The show was part of a wave of “redneck reality” shows like “Swamp People,” “Duck Dynasty,” “Bayou Billionaires” and “Moonshiners” that presented a vision of white, rural America as the last authentic place on earth, the last place untarnished by the corruption and cynicism of the elites. “Hollywood Hillbillies” aired on the Reelz Network, a channel owned by a billionaire Republican donor Stanley Hubbard , who funded a pro-Trump “super” PAC after his preferred candidates lost the primaries. Designed as a harmless comedy, the show reveled in Mema’s provocative, off-color remarks, just as Donald J. Trump’s audience revels in his. But now I’m thinking more critically about what shows like this are selling. All of these shows have one thing in common: While trafficking in rural stereotypes, they celebrate wealth and business success — whether that business is crafting hick-hop music, catching alligators or designing duck calls. Ostensibly produced for middle America, they offer a population disenfranchised by globalization and the information economy a vision of rural ingenuity rewarded. Mr. Trump based his candidacy around this population. He spoke directly to voters raised on reality TV, addressing their fears and aspirations with blunt talk. He became their perfect celebrity champion, a rich white man, his image polished by years in a reality-TV boardroom, who validated their demographic anxiety. In an election season driven more by hatred of political opponents than enthusiasm for two deeply unpopular candidates, President-Elect Donald J. Trump hated best, and won. I am wondering today if the same embarrassment that prevents some of us from admitting that we watch “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” also kept Trump supporters from admitting to pollsters that they were voting for a man they knew the media considered a bigot. Two months ago, I started working on a new series, “Trumpigration,” a travel show about where to move if Donald Trump somehow got elected. That, too, was designed as a lighthearted comedy. Now, facing the prospect of four years of a Trump presidency, it’s beginning to feel like the last chance to change the channel.  By  Roberto Suro  If you are in shock over the election results, don’t blame Latinos. They favored Hillary Clinton by better than two to one, according to the exit polls. They did not turn out in big numbers to protest Donald J. Trump, but it probably would not have mattered. It turns out that Latinos were the election’s biggest losers and not just because Mr. Trump won the presidency after a long campaign of slinging threats and insults at them. The bitterest loss was dealt by the 59.5 million mostly white people who voted for Mr. Trump. That was a rejection by their own countrymen. According to the exit polls — a rough measure of turnout at best — Latinos accounted for 11 percent of the votes cast Tuesday the same as 2012. If those numbers hold, there was little or no Trump effect, and however much the number of Latino votes increased was just a result of demography. You may have been convinced that it would be otherwise. Years of reckless commentary, news stories and advocacy insisted that Latinos would be the great demographic firewall that would safeguard progressive politics with surging population numbers. But, the firewall only stands in a few states, and the biggest of them, California, New York and Texas, are already decided. Mr. Trump concentrated instead on the old industrial states where Latinos are a sparse presence. When he demonized Mexico and unauthorized immigrants, he gained more in the Electoral College by mobilizing white voters than he lost by alienating Latinos. The national exit polls show that Mrs. Clinton drew 65 percent of the Latino vote compared with 29 percent for Mr. Trump. That is a landslide by any measure, and it is about the same margin in the exit polls for 2008 (67 percent vs. 31 percent). The disappointment sets in when you compare the outcome to 2012. President Barack Obama took 71 percent of the Latino vote in the exit polls that year compared with 27 percent for Mitt Romney. Mr. Trump was supposed to be the bucket of cold water that aroused the sleeping giant, producing not only a stronger preference for the Democratic candidate but also, more important, a spike in turnout. In 2012, with immigration reform on the line, more than 12 million Latino voters stayed home, producing a turnout rate of 48 percent compared with 64 percent for whites and 67 percent for blacks. The much ballyhooed and chronicled “Trump Effect” was supposed to have produced a surge in naturalizations and voter registration over the past year, and news organizations were churning out stories about the “surge” in Latino voting even after the polls closed Tuesday. While more time and data is needed to get a full picture of Latino turnout this year, at first glance it appears Latino numbers were up, and perhaps significantly in some places, but that in fact the giant was barely stirred. Four million more Latinos were eligible to vote Tuesday than in 2012. So, no matter who was running and no matter how low the turnout, the number of Latino votes counted Tuesday was virtually certain to be higher than 2012. In fact, demographic growth alone would have guaranteed Mrs. Clinton an additional 1.3 million votes (about 1 percent of the total votes cast), even if turnout remained at the same dismal rate as 2012, and she got two-thirds of the Latino votes. In Colorado and Nevada, Latino voters surely helped keep the states blue, and under different scenarios those states could have served as the much-advertised Latino firewall. The one real bright spot for Latino Democrats Tuesday came with the election of Catherine Cortez Masto to the Senate in Nevada. That vote may illustrate what it takes to wake up the Latino electorate: a charismatic and qualified candidate, strong mediating institutions, in this case the hospitality workers’ unions in Las Vegas, and well-organized political operation like the one created by Senator Harry Reid, the retiring Democratic leader. Meanwhile, something may have happened in Texas that needs a closer look. Mr. Trump won handily, but only by a 9 percent margin. President Obama lost the state by nearly 16 points in 2012 and by almost 12 points in 2008. A lot of non-Latino newcomers have begun to change the political complexion of the state in recent years, and that formula — newcomers plus Latinos — is what flipped Colorado and Nevada in the past. Florida is the one place where Latinos might have been able to change the results of this election and didn’t. In the exit polls, Latinos accounted for 18 percent of the total vote compared with 17 in 2012, and the split was slightly more favorable to Mrs. Clinton than it was for President Obama four years ago. Mrs. Clinton’s vote tally was more than 200,000 higher than President Obama’s, but Mr. Trump’s was more than 400,000 higher than Mr. Romney’s. And therein lies the result that Latinos will have to live with for the next four years. In a state that has vividly benefited from immigration and trade, a state where Latinos have for the most part prospered and contributed to the prosperity of their neighbors, white voters mobilized to elect a candidate who would angrily erase everything Latinos represent. No one else suffered that kind of defeat on Tuesday.  By  Kevin M. Kruse  With so many predictions about this presidential campaign having turned out to be so very wrong, comparisons to the 1948 presidential race come naturally. In that election, virtually everyone predicted that the Republican Thomas Dewey would beat the “accidental president,” the Democrat, Harry Truman. Pollsters reinforced these assumptions. Elmer Roper announced that he was so sure Dewey would win that he wouldn’t even bother reporting poll results anymore. “My silence on this point can be construed as an indication that Mr. Dewey is still so clearly ahead that we might as well just listen to his inaugural address,” he said. George Gallup kept polling until mid-October, but then rested on those results, assuming the race was over. Pundits agreed. Newsweek surveyed 50 of the nation’s top political reporters in October; every single one said Dewey would win. Republicans and Democrats alike assumed the race was over. On election night, the conservative Chicago Tribune was so confident it called the race early, rushing out a banner headline that would soon be as famous as it was wrong: “Dewey Defeats Truman.” To the amazement of nearly everyone, Truman won by considerable margins. In the popular vote, he took 49.6 percent to Dewey’s 45.1 percent. In the Electoral College, he won 303 votes to Dewey’s 189. While the margins of this year’s election are narrower, the shock and confusion of pollsters and analysts seems just as pronounced. But comparisons between the Truman and Trump campaigns are not neatly drawn. Truman was an outspoken liberal, and he campaigned on preserving and expanding the accomplishments of the New Deal welfare state. He called for expansion of Social Security, more progressive forms of taxation, a higher minimum wage, and a new national system of health insurance. Truman also committed the Democratic Party, long dominated by Southern segregationists, to a new racial liberalism. Notably, he called on Congress to protect the voting rights of African-Americans. In foreign policy, Truman set America against the growing influence of the Soviet Union. In 1947, he announced the Truman Doctrine, which prompted economic aid to Europe through the Marshall Plan and military alliances through a new North Atlantic Treaty Organization. A year later, Truman challenged Soviet expansionism with the Berlin Airlift. Mr. Trump has rejected much of the substance of Truman’s campaign, but in many ways he reflected its style. Truman’s famous “whistle-stop campaign” took him to rural communities and small towns where working-class and middle-class whites felt neglected. In fiery speeches with blunt language, he singled out sources of blame. Truman went after the “do nothing” Republican Congress as a prominent foe, but also denounced an array of “special interests,” including “bloodsuckers who have offices on Wall Street.” Truman named these enemies and promised to “give ’em’ hell.” His crowds believed him and rallied to their candidate. On Election Day, he predicted there were would be “a lot of surprised pollsters.” There were. Though he had reason to gloat, Truman was gracious in victory. The day after the election, the Washington Post staff invited him to a “crow banquet.” All the newspaper pundits, radio commentators and pollsters who predicted his defeat would wear sackcloth and force down a main course of crow; the president, in white tie and tails, would be served roast turkey. Truman declined, saying he had “no desire to crow over anybody or to see anybody eat crow, figuratively or otherwise.” He added, “We should all get together now and make a country in which everybody can eat turkey whenever he pleases.” Mr. Trump is not a politician who operates by anyone else’s playbook, but perhaps in this small but important matter, he can take a lesson from history.  By  Maureen Sullivan  I have to admit it: I am loving it. As the results poured in for Donald J. Trump, I reveled in the Facebook friends who openly mourned the end of humanity. I felt gleeful in trolling the Twitter hashtag #HesNotMyPresident: “I’m laying in bed with tears streaming down my face, just thinking about the future of this country.” This was one of the biggest election upsets in history, so of course everyone is stunned. Me too. Switching among three cable news networks and several websites I wondered: Is he really going to take Florida so easily? Did they just call North Carolina for Trump? Can he possibly win Wisconsin? Pennsylvania? Yup. I rooted for Mitt Romney in 2012 and John McCain in 2008. I ran for the school board in Hoboken, N.J., and lost once before winning the following year. I know what it’s like to have your hopes puddle up on the floor like that dollop of election-night Haagen-Dazs that you dropped and you just don’t care to wipe up. What does it matter? All is lost. You want to announce on Twitter that you are in bed letting the tears stream down your face. I saw this result coming over the summer. In July, five police officers were ambushed in Dallas and three more were killed in Baton Rouge. In August, Colin Kaepernick, the San Francisco 49ers quarterback, sat out the national anthem. In September, an Islamic terrorist, masquerading as a fried chicken salesman in my hometown, Elizabeth, N.J., set off bombs in New York and New Jersey. Mrs. Clinton proclaimed: “I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police.” She put half of Trump’s supporters in that “basket of deplorables.” People I know were angry. They were tired of being told they were racist and bigoted as they went about the business of mowing their lawns, writing college tuition checks and working their jobs as cops, secretaries and teachers’ aides. They kept being told they needed to look inward, examine their sins and judge themselves guilty. They had not forgotten when Barack Obama was running for president in 2008 and his wife, Michelle, said, “For the first time in my adult lifetime, I’m really proud of my country…” So now we have President-Elect Donald Trump. I supported him because he promised to curb regulations, cut taxes and appoint constitutionalists to the Supreme Court. I supported him because Mrs. Clinton doesn’t have what it takes to turn around a stagnant economy or stand up to the special interests that block innovation. In his victory speech, Mr. Trump lifted a line from Abraham Lincoln and spoke of “binding wounds.” I wanted him to be gracious and kind in that moment, and he was. My 89-year-old mother is still appalled by my vote and tells me, with a laugh, that she’s moving to Ireland. And one of my disappointed female friends on Facebook — who, like me is white and college-educated — wrote, “Obama helped expose the deeply racist nature of our country. Trump exposes the anti-intellectual, sexist xenophobia.” But most of my friends, some of whom I suspect cast votes like mine, have stayed quiet. I guess it’s still not politically correct to admit that you are on the Trump train.  By  Viet Thanh Nguyen  Worst-case scenario in the next four years: fascism, a wall, mass deportations, the end of Obamacare, a Trump brand on the White House and either a trade war or an actual war with China (since war is the easiest diversion from domestic unhappiness). Best-case scenario: Ruth Bader Ginsburg refuses to retire or die, the Democratic Party finds a backbone, turns away from its fixation on the center and heeds the call for an economic revolt against the 1 percent, joined by Black Lives Matter, the Occupy movement, and resurgent feminism. Both scenarios could happen at the same time. The second scenario requires Democrats to put their status quo political model to rest. They already had a significant portion of the nonwhite minority vote locked up, but have lost too many working-class white people. Bernie Sanders might not have won over the wealthier whites who were voting with Trump against the seemingly rising tide of minorities, but he might have snared the white working class and some of the white middle class. Here’s the bright side, for those, like me, who are on the liberal-to-left spectrum. If Hillary Clinton had won, she would have run again in 2020, which could have meant four more years of Wall Street liberalism and fire-and-forget perpetual warfare, conducted by drones and Special Operations over the horizon. Now perhaps Elizabeth Warren will be the 2020 Democratic candidate — a white woman, a feminist, and someone more progressive than Clinton. But all this speaks largely about domestic electoral politics. The sickness of the American body politic remains untreated, and will remain untreated, or exacerbated, in a country run by clowns, conspirators, and collaborators. That sickness is imperialism. America is an imperial country, and its decay might now be showing. The power that has brought so much benefit to the country — for white people — is now faltering in its ability to provide those benefits to all white people. The empire’s best hope is to be more inclusive, demographically and economically, but that runs counter to the imperial impulse to hoard power and profit. Warren or someone like her might be better at extracting more social and economic justice for all Americans. But unless such a person finds a way to ease control from the financial-industrial complex, the prospects of halting our decline are weak. Empires rot from the inside even as emperors blame the barbarians.  By  Robert N. Stavins  Donald J. Trump once tweeted that “the concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing noncompetitive.” Twitter messages may not be clear signs of likely public policies, but Mr. Trump followed up during the campaign with his “America First Energy Plan,” which would rescind all of President Obama’s actions on climate change. The plan includes canceling United States participation in the Paris climate agreement and stopping all American funding of United Nations climate change programs. It also includes abandoning the Clean Power Plan, a mainstay of the Obama administration’s approach to achieving its emissions reduction target for carbon dioxide under the Paris agreement. What should we make of such campaign promises? Taking Mr. Trump at his word, he will surely seek to pull the country out of the Paris pact. But because the agreement has already come into force, under the rules, any party must wait three years before requesting to withdraw, followed by a one-year notice period. Those rules would seem to be mere technicalities. The incoming Trump administration simply can disregard America’s pledge to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 26 to 28 percent below the 2005 level by 2025. That is bad enough. But the big worry is what other key countries, including the world’s largest emitter, China, as well as India and Brazil, will do if the United States reneges on its pledge. The result could be that the Paris agreement unravels, taking it from the 97 percent of global emissions currently covered by the pact to little more than the European Union’s 10 percent share. In addition, Mr. Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency probably will stop work on regulations of methane emissions (a very potent greenhouse gas) from existing oil and gas operations. Undoing complex existing regulations, such as the Clean Power Plan, will be more difficult, but a reconstituted Supreme Court will probably help President Trump when that plan inevitably comes before the court. Also, the new president will most likely ask that the Keystone XL pipeline permit application be renewed — and facilitate other oil and gas pipelines around the country. On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump promised to “bring back” the coal industry by cutting environmental regulations. That may not be so easy. The decline of that industry and related employment has been caused by technological changes in mining, and competition from low-priced natural gas for electricity generation, not by environmental regulations. At the same time, Mr. Trump has pledged to promote fracking for oil and gas, but that would make natural gas even more economically attractive, and accelerate the elimination of coal-sector jobs. If he lives up to his campaign rhetoric, Mr. Trump may indeed be able to reverse course on climate change policy, increasing the threat to our planet, and in the process destroy much of the Obama legacy in this important realm. This will make the states even more important players on this critical issue.  By  Dani Rodrik  The real costs of a Donald J. Trump presidency will most likely come on the political rather than on the economic side. We are likely to see some rise in trade barriers and unilateral economic policies. But for all his bluster, I do not expect Mr. Trump to engage in indiscriminate protectionism. We live in a world of supply chains where imposing tariffs on Mexican or Chinese imports will raise costs of United States businesses and make it hard for them to compete. Mr. Trump is a businessman, and he will understand soon, if he does not now, the senselessness of blanket protectionism. We may have plenty of trade disputes with foreign countries. It’s useful to bear in mind here the example of the 1980s, when trade frictions with Japan and other leading exporters produced a slew of so-called new protectionist barriers such as voluntary export restraints. But these did very limited damage to the world economy. Before long, the world embarked on a further and more intense round of globalization. Furthermore, we have robust international institutions, like the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization, that did not exist in the interwar period. And the political lobbies in favor of an open economy (big business and banks) are stronger and retain considerable influence in Washington. So even though the 1930s parallel is on everyone’s mind, I do not think we are in for a collapse of the international economic order and a retreat into trade war. The real danger Mr. Trump poses is the undermining of our politics — the norms that sustain our liberal democracies. His campaign was based on a divisive politics of identity. Ideals of equity, equal rights, diversity and inclusion were submerged under the weight of a rhetoric that raised racial and ethnic tensions and inflamed passions against imagined enemies — Mexican immigrants, Chinese exporters, Muslim refugees. Illiberal democracy has been the bane of several nations around the world. Under Mr. Trump, the traditions in the United States of checks and balances and of rule of law will be tested seriously. The political danger will be greatly magnified by Mr. Trump’s likely economic failure. He comes into office as the putative leader of middle and lower classes who feel they have been left behind. He has raised their expectations in ways that he cannot meet. There is little chance that incomes at the middle and lower end of income distribution will receive a large boost under his policies. The manufacturing jobs that have left will not return no matter how tough Mr. Trump’s trade policies get. These jobs have disappeared for good, largely thanks to technological changes, and not trade. When the full scale of his economic disappointment sinks in sometime during his term, Mr. Trump may well react in the time-honored fashion of global populists like President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. To keep his base mobilized and insulate himself from economic troubles, he may take shelter in an intensified form of the identity politics that worked so well for him during the presidential campaign. This would rip American society further apart along racial and ethnic cleavages. The ugliness that characterized politics during the presidential campaign may be nothing compared with what may be yet to come.  By  Teresa Tritch  Financial markets regained their footing on Wednesday, as investors and traders apparently concluded that a Donald Trump presidency might not be so bad after all. Instead of focusing on how unprepared Mr. Trump is to be president, several traders quoted in the media talked about how deregulation from ending Obamacare and the Dodd-Frank financial reforms — two Republican goals — could lift stock prices for health care companies and banks. They took special solace in Mr. Trump’s promise to boost government spending on infrastructure and in the measured tones of his acceptance speech. Unfortunately, there is no escaping the overarching conclusion that Mr. Trump’s campaign promises, if carried out, would harm the economy. His proposed rollback of Dodd-Frank reforms would invite renewed recklessness. His opposition to Obamacare would renew and intensify households’ financial insecurity. His proposed tax cuts for the rich would exacerbate income inequality, while either blowing a hole in the deficit or requiring deep budget cuts. His stance on trade would impair international commerce and cooperation. His proposed deportation of immigrants would unleash a legal and humanitarian crisis. Even his popular call for more infrastructure spending is flawed. In and of itself, Mr. Trump’s pledge to borrow vast sums to spend on infrastructure would be a sensible move at this time of low interest rates. But vastly increased federal indebtedness in addition to his other harmful economic policies would be piling risk on top of risk. Risk-taking that crosses the line into recklessness can be immensely profitable in the short run, which is what many traders care most about. But it is no way to run an economy on which everyone else depends for long-term prosperity.  By  Emily Bazelon  Now it looks like a warning shot. When Justice Antonin Scalia died in February, Donald Trump was among the first to call for stonewalling President Obama’s choice to fill the seat. “It’s called delay, delay, delay,” he said at the opening of the Republican presidential debate on Feb. 13. Senator Harry Reid, the minority leader, countered that it would be “unprecedented in recent history” for the Supreme Court to go a year without a full complement of justices. But other Republicans, chief among them the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, agreed with Mr. Trump and Senator Ted Cruz: Justice Scalia’s seat should remain vacant until after the election. Undeterred (what else was he supposed to be?), President Obama nominated Merrick Garland, a seasoned judge praised in the past by Republicans like Senator Orrin Hatch. A debate ensued over historical facts, which seems quaintly polite in retrospect. Since 1900, had the Senate ever refused to confirm a nominee in a presidential election year as a result of the impending election? The answer was no (even if Mr. Cruz tried to argue, against the facts, that Justice Anthony Kennedy wasn’t confirmed in the election year of 1988.) The Republicans’ refusal to grant Judge Garland a hearing or schedule a vote was in fact unprecedented. It was a new kind of hardball. And it succeeded. For a blip in August, Republicans took a hit in the polls for  obstructing the Garland nomination. But the moment passed, blown away in the chaos and battle of the presidential election. Judge Garland slipped from view. The parties adapted to a new reality in which both expected either his postelection, pre-inauguration confirmation, or a new nominee chosen by the next president. When they assumed Hillary Clinton would win, Republicans including Senators John McCain of Arizona  and Richard Burr of North Carolina talked about blocking Democratic Supreme Court picks indefinitely. Both were re-elected Tuesday and will return to a Senate still controlled by the Republicans. It’s hard to see how any Republican paid a price for radically altering the norms for Supreme Court appointments. Mr. Trump helped point the way, and the voters rewarded him and those who followed. Choosing a justice in Antonin Scalia’s mold, as he has promised, will allow Mr. Trump to prove himself to the social conservatives for whom the court, and Roe v. Wade, are the defining issues. Under the current rules, Democrats could filibuster his choice, but if that happens, how long will those rules last? 
Mr. Trump’s election has already run over far stronger traditions and norms. Next comes the question of how many additional Supreme Court appointments will come his way. Ruth Bader Ginsburg is 83. Anthony Kennedy is 80. Stephen Breyer is 78. In Supreme Court terms, four years is a long time.  By  Peter Wehner  To say that Donald Trump’s victory was a shock may qualify as the understatement of the century. The polls were wrong. The experts were wrong. I was wrong. Almost everyone was wrong — including those in the Trump campaign who expected to lose. His victory wasn’t just a surprise; it was an event of gigantic dimensions, its radiating effects incalculable. Mr. Trump’s win ranks among the most unlikely and stunning elections in American history. Regardless of how the Trump presidency turns out, this race will be studied a century from now. For those of us who have been vehement critics of Mr. Trump, this is a rather challenging moment. Starting on Jan. 20, he will be the only president we have. He now has a democratic legitimacy we may regret but cannot deny, and there is such a thing as democratic grace. To those who are tempted only to rage and attack and lament what has occurred, a word of counsel to them, and to myself: We need to give Mr. Trump the chance to rise to the moment, as unlikely as we think that may be. At the same time, we can’t possibly erase the history of the last 17 months — the words he said, the things he did, the conspiracy theories he wove, the ignorance, volatility and cruelty he showed — and our concerns aren’t going to evaporate now that he’s about to be in charge of the nuclear triad that during the campaign he didn’t even know existed. I believed, and still believe, that he is a man with a disordered personality and authoritarian tendencies. My job is to give him a chance to prove me wrong; his job is to prove me wrong. Among my worries is that Mr. Trump’s victory will validate his style of politics, his serrated rhetoric. The way he mistreats people will be normalized. This election has brought us to dark places. Rather than this approach being repudiated it will, for many, become a model. “All the decent drapery of life is to be rudely torn off,” in the words of Edmund Burke. If the Trump campaign foreshadows his presidency, America under Trump will be fundamentally different than it has been — coarser, less temperate and civilized, more inward and resentful. The Republican Party will fundamentally change, from a conservative party to one that champions European-style ethnic nationalism. (The Democratic Party, whose members were certain Hillary Clinton would win, will be convulsed as it enters a period of intense recrimination.) A few hours after Mr. Trump was declared the winner, I received a note from a friend of mine, the distinguished Christian writer Philip Yancey, who told me, “I’m surprised and befuddled, but not scared, thanks to the checks-and-balances strength of American democracy. I tremble, though, to think what an unpredictable leader offers to a world in growing crisis.” He added, “Some say God moves in mysterious ways.  I say, God grants humans the freedom to move in even more mysterious ways.” What happened on Nov. 8th was a mystery that may lead to calamity. I hope to God it won’t.  By  Anna North  I spent the days leading up to the election in Pennsylvania talking to some young voters , 18, 19, 20 years old. They wore flowered Doc Martens, fake fur coats, earbuds dangling from one ear. Overwhelmingly, they were open and polite. They were smart. They were angry at a political system they felt ignored them, but they hoped for better days ahead. In January, Donald Trump will be their next president. Many of these young people supported Mr. Trump. Many did so reluctantly. One young Trump supporter told me that no one knows exactly what Mr. Trump will do in office. Another described hesitating while filling out his absentee ballot, wondering if he could vote for a man who had made abhorrent comments about women. But some voted for Mr. Trump enthusiastically. Those who supported Hillary Clinton were disgusted by Mr. Trump and what he stands for. Today, they’re dealing with a new reality they didn’t expect. I’m thinking of Bria Blackshear, a 20-year-old Temple University student who had waited more than an hour at her polling place in north Philadelphia. “Donald Trump doesn’t represent the ideals I would want for this country,” she said. I’m thinking of Brooke Renner, 18, also a Temple student, who was waiting in line for a second time. She’d given up earlier, but was back and willing to wait as long as it took to cast her vote for Mrs. Clinton. Otherwise, she said, “I’d feel personally responsible if Donald Trump wins.” I’m thinking of Sierra Taylor, a 19-year-old student at the Community College of Philadelphia, who said, “black people feel like our votes don’t matter.” I’m thinking of her friend Naiya Johnson, 22, who, when asked about her hopes for the next four years, said, “I hope we make it.” I’m also thinking of the young people I saw debating the issues that matter to them. Of the table full of young men at Bucks County Community College arguing about Mr. Trump when one, the quietest, spoke up to say, “Trump has no respect for women.” Of the young man, who, as his friend criticized Mrs. Clinton’s record as secretary of state, interjected that Mr. Trump is racist, sexist and xenophobic. They’d had the argument once before, they said. I hope they keep talking. I think they will. It’s a frightening time to grow up. But these young voters are clear-eyed about the shortcomings of government and optimistic enough to imagine a better world. They can make friends with people of different viewpoints, and, when it matters, they can challenge their friends to think in a new way.  By  Seamus McGraw  BRODHEADSVILLE, Pa. — Thinking back now, I can’t for the life of me figure out how I got it so wrong. He seemed so troubled by what he was about to do, as if he knew it was a mistake, but one he felt compelled to make. The way I read the pained look on his face, I thought he was almost apologizing; maybe seeking a kind of absolution. It was just a few days before the election, and I had been canvassing for the Democrats. I wasn’t out there because I was a particularly ardent Clinton supporter. She had certainly not been my first choice, my second or even my third. I’m one of those middle-aged white men without a college degree who had been holding out for Joe Biden to change his mind. But I felt as if I had an obligation to make certain that, at least in my little corner of Pennsylvania, a man who was, to my mind, so obviously unsuited to the highest office in the world, was not just defeated, but repudiated. I expected that my neighbors and friends and the strangers down the road would do just that. Sure, I could feel and even share their frustration over the fact that the longest postwar economic recovery had left so many of my neighbors behind. I had been left behind, too. And yes, I understood the fear of an uncertain world, and the stress of profound cultural changes that were upending so many things that my neighbors took as bedrock values. But I thought the character traits that had always defined the people I knew in eastern Pennsylvania — true conservatives with a sense of responsibility and decency — would in the end lead them to reject “Trumpism,” whatever that actually is. My job wasn’t to help Clinton win. I thought — or at least the pundits were telling me — that was a done deal. The way I saw it, my only task was to drive up her margins and to do that, I was working off a carefully curated list of likely Clinton voters thoughtfully provided to me by the local campaign office. And so when I knocked on this gentleman’s door on a back road in the rural, conservative West End of Monroe County, and he told me that he was indeed planning on voting for Donald Trump, I was ready to simply turn away. But he wouldn’t let me go. “I just can’t trust her,” he said. He made eye contact and kept it. Relentlessly. He and I were of the same rough demographic. Just like me, he was well into his 50s, with teeth that had seen better days. Just like me, he was lower middle class, judging from his surroundings. And as he rattled off a list of shopworn talking points — Benghazi, emails, pay for play — I felt as if I was hearing a stranger’s confession. I felt as if he wanted me to understand and forgive him for what he was about to do. I remember thinking to myself that when this was over, I was going to have to find a way to build a bridge back to this guy who was, in so many ways, just like me. Such was my arrogance. Late last night, as I watched Pennsylvania turn red for the first time in a generation, I kept thinking back to that man, and how I so misread his expression and his words. It wasn’t sorrow etched in his face. It was pity. For me. Because he knew, long before I did, how wrong I was.  —  Seamus McGraw is the author of “Betting the Farm on a Drought.”   By  Beverly Gage  In his victory speech last night, Donald J. Trump paid homage to “the forgotten men and women of our country,” vowing that they “will be forgotten no longer.” This essential political idea — that a vast segment of the nation’s white citizens have been overlooked, or looked down upon — has driven every major realignment in American politics since the New Deal. In 1932, at the darkest moment of the Great Depression, Franklin Roosevelt evoked the “forgotten man” as a reason to rebuild the economy from the “bottom up.” More than three decades later, after Richard Nixon’s 1968 victory, the journalist Peter Schrag identified the “Forgotten American” — the white “lower middle class” voter — as the key to the nation’s apparent rejection of the Great Society and the New Deal order. “In the guise of the working class — or the American yeoman or John Smith — he was once the hero of the civic books, the man that Andrew Jackson called ‘the bone and sinew of the country,’ ” Mr. Schrag wrote. “Now he is ‘the forgotten man,’ perhaps the most alienated person in America.” That this “forgotten” American could be used both to uphold and to dismantle liberalism suggests that this American political identity has never been especially fixed: Democrat or Republican, liberal or conservative, but populist above all. Since the 1960s, the phrase has also implied that the country was paying too much attention to the wrong sorts of people — most notably, to African-Americans — at the expense of the white working class.
It is no coincidence that the “forgotten men and women of our country” began their migration into the Republican Party at the very moment that African-Americans were asserting their right to vote, and voting Democratic, in large numbers for the first time. Mr. Trump’s victory will go down as one of the great upsets in United States history, but it is also the product of a long and bitter struggle over race and class in this country. The Yale sociologist William Graham Sumner is often credited with coining the term “forgotten man.” Writing near the dawn of the Progressive Era, he lamented the lost autonomy of hard-working citizens suddenly forced to pay for high-flown programs of social reform. Sumner’s most famous political essay, “What the Social Classes Owe to Each Other,” rejected the very idea that government might mitigate class antagonisms by sharing the social wealth. What did social classes owe to each other? Not much, in Sumner’s view. And his “forgotten man” owed the least of all. In his 1932 campaign for the presidency, Roosevelt sought to claim the term for a different and more expansive purpose. “These unhappy times call for the building of plans that rest upon the forgotten,” he said in a radio address from Albany in April 1932, for plans “that build from the bottom up and not from the top down, that put their faith once more in the forgotten man at the bottom of the economic pyramid.” To Roosevelt, the “forgotten man” encompassed the industrial worker and struggling farmer and Keynesian consumer — ordinary citizens without whom a modern economy would falter. He built the New Deal around this image, establishing the minimum wage, Social Security and the federal right to organize unions. Those reforms cemented the loyalty of the white working class to the Democratic Party for a generation. But the New Deal also “forgot” — or excluded — many people, including African-Americans. When the Great Society came along, Lyndon Johnson tried to make up for that by expanding federal programs serving the poor and by championing the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts. As the country started to “remember” its long-delayed promises of equality, however, the “forgotten American” began to emerge as term of exclusion and resistance to change. “There is hardly a language to describe him, or even a set of social statistics,” Mr. Schrag wrote in his August 1969 essay, “ The Forgotten American .” “Just names: racist-bigot-redneck-ethnic-Irish-Italian-Pole-Hunkie-Yahoo. The lower middle class. A blank.” As Mr. Schrag noted, all of that name-calling was part of the problem, a refusal on the part of liberal elites to recognize the real grievances and desires of what had once been a bedrock Democratic constituency. In the 1968 campaign, Nixon capitalized on this resentment with calls for “law and order,” a phrase that evoked not only fears of crime, but also anger at protesters and rioters and the college-campus liberals who tolerated them. Mr. Trump put that phrase back into political circulation in 2016, a gesture of solidarity with the old ways of thinking about the “silent majority” — and the “forgotten American.” And though he included “men and women” in his victory speech, Mr. Trump’s campaign mobilized around the same image that once animated the Roosevelt coalition: the “forgotten” white working-class man. Race, too, remains an indelible part of today’s conversation about who has been “forgotten” and who deserves to be seen. To dismiss this language as simple racism, however, is to miss at least some of its political significance. What happened in the late 1960s and 1970s was not only that the Republican Party reclaimed and redefined Roosevelt’s “forgotten man” for a more conservative age. During those years, the Democratic Party itself began to turn away from the New Deal and its working-class politics, especially from its commitment to organized labor. With Mr. Trump’s election, we may be witnessing the rise of a new party system, with the Democrats now the standard-bearers of racial tolerance and free-market globalization, and the Republicans the party of nationalist populist revolt. But as Roosevelt showed, this need not be a fixed political equation. If the 2016 election marks the final, gasping end of the New Deal coalition, it should also mark the start of a new reckoning within the Democratic Party.  By  Helen Lewis  LONDON — You can’t throw a peanut in a Westminster pub without hitting an obsessive follower of American politics. Start a conversation about “The West Wing” with any member of Parliament and expect to get a long disquisition on that American political drama’s best episodes. During Britain’s last general election, in 2015, both main political parties here proudly boasted about being advised by veterans of Barack Obama’s campaign. Until now, our Americophilia has been unrequited. Then in August, Donald J. Trump declared himself “Mr. Brexit.” For Mr. Trump and his supporters, Britain’s vote in June to leave the European Union was evidence of a growing popular revolt against multiculturalism, porous borders and political elites. If the British electorate could deliver a result that baffled its financial sector, its scientists and metropolitan liberals – and was not widely predicted by pollsters – couldn’t the same sort of upset happen in America? It just did. Mr. Trump’s victory feels like a flashback to June, although where Brexit divided members of Britain’s political class, the American election results have united them. Politicians of the mainstream right and left alike are dumbfounded that the United States  would elect someone who uses the extreme language Mr. Trump does and who seems to have little love for institutions like NATO. Last December, Britain’s former Conservative prime minister, David Cameron, described Mr. Trump’s proposed ban on Muslims entering America as “divisive, stupid and wrong.” The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan of the Labour Party, has called the president-elect’s views on Islam “ignorant.” Apart from Nigel Farage, the face of the far-right U.K. Independence Party, it is difficult to find a British politician with a good word to say about Mr. Trump. Nationalism, white anger and protectionism are now driving politics in Britain and across Europe. The sound is of doors slamming. Brexit felt like a referendum on border control, and on rapid demographic change among white communities that felt themselves deprived of attention and resources. It is tempting to draw comparisons with the United States: The big cities in both Britain and the United States, which are most diverse, are also most relaxed about that diversity. In smaller communities, immigration feels more disruptive. There are other parallels. Mr. Trump’s victory was driven by older, white voters, who were struggling but not destitute. He won white men without college degrees by a landslide. A typical Leave supporter has a similar demographic profile. Such voters are on the decline, as both Britain and the United States become more diverse and younger generations are better-educated, and more open to immigration and change. But as both the Brexit vote and Mr. Trump’s victory showed, they are far from a spent force.  By  Susan Chira  Women, as Hillary Clinton showed this morning , know how to absorb pain. And Mrs. Clinton has had plenty of practice about how to stand before the cameras after public humiliation. Clearly, she needed time to compose herself. She made no appearances overnight, instead calling Donald J. Trump to concede. But when she strode onstage in purple and gray, Bill Clinton behind her in a purple tie, her voice did not waver. Women seldom have the luxury of giving in to pain. Many have children or grandchildren or aging parents to tend, whether they themselves are sick or in emotional turmoil. So Mrs. Clinton faced her despondent campaign staff and her despondent half of the country and tried to rally them. She spoke most directly to young people, and to women and girls. She had hoped to stand before them as a symbol of all that women could achieve. Now she had to demonstrate once again what women can endure. “I’ve had successes and setbacks, sometimes really painful ones,” she told them. It was hard not to recall her standing beside Bill Clinton after the whole world knew graphic and humiliating details about the affairs he had denied having. “To all the women and especially the young women who put their faith in me I want you to know that nothing has made me prouder than to be your champion,” she said, and here she had to clear her throat. “I know we still have not shattered that highest and hardest glass ceiling but some day somebody will, and hopefully sooner than we might think right now.” It’s difficult to know right now all that stood in the way of shattering that ceiling. Was it a woman, or this woman? Was it Mrs. Clinton as symbol of the Washington establishment, as a consummate insider in a time of profound distrust of the elite? We do know that voters disproportionately punish women who are seen as dishonest. We do know that it’s hard for strong, assertive and ambitious women to be seen as likable and competent at the same time. Political scientists and cultural commentators will long debate what happened in this election, to this woman and to many women.  The question is whether the image of Mrs. Clinton, composed and gracious in defeat, persevering through pain, will inspire women to try again?  By  Felix Salmon  Markets always move after seismic events, like the unexpected election of Donald J. Trump. Still, market moves need to be interpreted. Even if you believe that markets are right, it’s not always obvious what they’re saying. One way to think about the market’s gyrations is the idea of mean and variation. When Barack Obama (a.k.a. No Drama Obama) was elected president, it was possible to anticipate — correctly, it turned out — that he would help steer America back onto a course of steady growth, low inflation and falling unemployment. Think of that as the Obama mean: the baseline expectation. When the stock market expects good things like that, it tends to rise, just as it has during the Obama presidency. But the variation is just as important as the mean. Mr. Obama didn’t always give the markets what they wanted, but by the same token he was always clear about what he was going to do. He promised them something much more valuable: a low-risk upward economic trajectory. Mr. Trump is the exact opposite of Mr. Obama. His baseline is worse, for starters: to establish expectations for his presidency, you have to factor in his hugely irresponsible fiscal policy, potential trade wars and maybe even reckless brinkmanship over repaying the national debt. Put those things together, and a severe recession becomes possible. But it gets even worse because Mr. Trump is by his nature highly unpredictable. However bad you think he’s going to be, it’s entirely possible that your prediction will turn out to be ridiculously optimistic. Mr. Trump has vastly more downside risk than Mr. Obama ever had, and so markets are going to trade at a discount to his already-discounted baseline. If you transition, then, from low-risk positive expectations to high-risk negative expectations, you have to expect the markets to take some precipitous plunges along the way. Much of that will be noise. The markets always fluctuate randomly in the short term, and there’s no point in trying to read anything meaningful into those moves. That’s why it’s dangerous to read too much into midnight stock-market futures trading, or a sudden plunge in the value of the Mexican peso once it becomes obvious that Mr. Trump will become president. Those moves might be a rational response to the lower expected value of the assets in question. On the other hand, they might just be the result of panicky hedging — or indeed they could simply represent dealers second-guessing and trying to outmaneuver one another. Once the market has been trading steadily for a few months, its general direction under the auspices of the new government is going to be pretty clear. Fluctuations over just a few hours, by contrast, are much harder to read. They might look like signals — but all too often they turn out to be nothing but noise. And as we’ve learned during this long, brutal election, separating noise from signals can be a very tricky business.  By  Michael Lerner  It turns out that shaming the supporters of Donald J. Trump is not a good political strategy. Though job loss and economic stagnation played a role in his victory, so did shame. As the principal investigator on a study of the middle class for the National Institute of Mental Health, I found that working people’s stress is often intensified by shame at their failure to “make it” in what they are taught is a meritocratic American economy. The right has been very successful at persuading working people that they are vulnerable not because they themselves have failed, but because of the selfishness of some other villain (African-Americans, feminists, immigrants, Muslims, Jews, liberals, progressives; the list keeps growing). Instead of challenging this ideology of shame, the left has buttressed it by blaming white people as a whole for slavery, genocide of the Native Americans and a host of other sins, as though whiteness itself was something about which people ought to be ashamed. The rage many white working-class people feel in response is rooted in the sense that once again, as has happened to them throughout their lives, they are being misunderstood. So please understand what is happening here. Many Trump supporters very legitimately feel that it is they who have been facing an unfair reality. The upper 20 percent of income earners, many of them quite liberal and rightly committed to the defense of minorities and immigrants, also believe in the economic meritocracy and their own right to have so much more than those who are less fortunate. So while they may be progressive on issues of discrimination against the obvious victims of racism and sexism, they are blind to their own class privilege and to the hidden injuries of class that are internalized by much of the country as self-blame. The right’s ability to portray liberals as elitists is further strengthened by the phobia toward religion that prevails in the left. Many religious people are drawn by the teachings of their tradition to humane values and caring about the oppressed. Yet they often find that liberal culture is hostile to religion of any sort, believing it is irrational and filled with hate. People on the left rarely open themselves to the possibility that there could be a spiritual crisis in society that plays a role in the lives of many who feel misunderstood and denigrated by the fancy intellectuals and radical activists. The left needs to stop ignoring people’s inner pain and fear. The racism, sexism and xenophobia used by Mr. Trump to advance his candidacy does not reveal an inherent malice in the majority of Americans. If the left could abandon all this shaming, it could rebuild its political base by helping Americans see that much of people’s suffering is rooted in the hidden injuries of class and in the spiritual crisis that the global competitive marketplace generates. Democrats need to become as conscious and articulate about the suffering caused by classism as we are about other forms of suffering. We need to reach out to Trump voters in a spirit of empathy and contrition. Only then can we help working people understand that they do not live in a meritocracy, that their intuition that the system is rigged is correct (but it is not by those whom they had been taught to blame) and that their pain and rage is legitimate."
"Creative Destruction Yada Yada","Jill Lepore has a great article in the New Yorker debunking the hyping of “disruptive innovation” as the key to success in business and everything else. It’s not a bah-humbug piece; it is instead a careful takedown, in which she goes back to the case studies supposedly showing the overwhelming importance of upstart innovators, and shows that what actually happened didn’t fit the script. Specifically, many of the “upstarts” were actually long-established firms, and more often than not the big payoffs went not to disruptive innovators but to firms that focused on incremental change and ordinary forms of efficiency and quality. Andrew Leonard reports that Silicon Valley types are not pleased . You can understand why. But their annoyance also tells you why the whole disruptive innovation thing took off: it glamorizes business, it lets nerdy guys come across as bold heroes. The same impulse, I think, is why Schumpeter gets cited so much. If you read his stuff directly, it’s interesting, I guess, although his attempts to explain the business cycle were a waste of good paper. But it’s that glamorizing phrase “creative destruction” that did it, because it’s so flattering to the big money (and excuses a lot of suffering, too). Lepore tells us that innovation became a popular buzzword in the 1990s. I guess I thought it came much earlier — I wrote about product-cycle models of trade back in the 1970s, and even then I was formalizing a much older literature. And in trade, as in business competition, it’s far from clear that the big rewards go to those who trash the past and invent new stuff. What’s the most remarkable export success story out there? Surely it’s Germany, which manages to be an export powerhouse despite very high labor costs. How do the Germans do it? Not by constantly coming out with revolutionary new products, but by producing very high quality goods for which people are willing to pay premium prices. So here’s a revolutionary thought: maybe we need to do less disruption and put more effort into doing whatever we do well. Paul Krugman is an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times. Advertisement"
"Family Life According to the Brotherhood","Advertisement By MONA EL-NAGGAR SEPT. 4, 2012  CAIRO — Women are erratic and emotional, and they make good wives and mothers — but never leaders or rulers. That, at least, is what Osama Abou Salama, a professor of botany at Cairo University and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, told young men and women during a recent premarital counseling class. What was striking, though, was the absence of any reaction. None of the 30 people in the class so much as winced. “A woman,” Mr. Abou Salama said, “takes pleasure in being a follower and finds ease in obeying a husband who loves her.” Since the Brotherhood rose to power and one of its former leaders was elected president , much of the uncertainty over its social agenda has centered on its plans for women. Will the Brotherhood try to impose a conservative dress code? Will it try to bar women from certain fields of work? Will its leaders promote segregation at schools? Advertisement But in a country where a vast majority of women already cover their hair and voluntarily separate from men in coed environments, for most people — women included — those questions are largely academic. Advertisement Mr. Abou Salama’s class makes that case. “Can you, as a woman, take a decision and handle the consequences of your decision?” he asked. A number of women shook their heads even before Mr. Abou Salama provided his answer: “No. But men can. And God created us this way because a ship cannot have more than one captain.” More than any other political group in Egypt, the Brotherhood is fluent in the dialect of the masses. By upholding patriarchal and traditional values about a woman’s place in society, it garners popular support, builds political capital and reinforces social conservatism. “The woman is the symbol of a moral platform through which easy gains can be made,” said Hania Sholkamy, an anthropologist and an associate professor at the Social Research Center at the American University in Cairo. “Those who deprive women of their rights, limit their freedom or place them in a subordinate position believe that the political cost of doing so is very low.” The lectures of Mr. Abou Salama, who has raised three daughters, are part of a four-week workshop called “Bride and Groom Against Satan” and sponsored by Family House, a charity financed by the Brotherhood. It is one of several Brotherhood efforts that have grown since the revolution, reflecting, as much as promoting, the religious values that define a large segment of society. Among its many activities, Family House offers financial support to struggling households, provides a matchmaking service and sponsors mass weddings for low-income couples. “This is part of the reformist methodology of the Muslim Brotherhood,” said Walaa Abdel Halim, the Family House coordinator who organizes the youth counseling workshop. “Shaping a righteous individual leads to shaping a righteous family, and by shaping a righteous family, you get a righteous society that can choose a righteous leader.” Those broader efforts at shaping a conservative religious society, played out over decades by the Brotherhood, were seen as partly responsible for helping elect Mohamed Morsi president in June. At the time, Mr. Morsi, who resigned from the Brotherhood after taking office, gave assurances that he would protect the rights of women and include them in decision making. Less than three months into his presidency, though, Mr. Morsi has not fulfilled a campaign promise to appoint a woman as a vice president. Instead, he named a team of 21 senior aides and advisers last week that included three women. Advertisement One of those three, Omaima Kamel, a medical professor at Cairo University and a member of the Brotherhood since 1981, makes it clear that she is not about to press society to change attitudes about women.

You must select a newsletter to subscribe to. “Let’s face it, if your work took you away from your fundamental duties at home and if your success came at the cost of your family life and the stability of your children, then you are the one who stands to lose,” she said by telephone. “A woman can work as much as she wants, but within the framework of our religious restrictions.” Many analysts and critics of the Brotherhood see that kind of philosophy, one that gives women independence so long as they maintain their traditional obligations, as effectively constraining women to established gender roles. “There is an absence of a well-defined vision, so they use words like ‘religious restrictions,’ ” said Ibrahim el-Houdaiby, a researcher of Islamic movements and a former member of the Brotherhood. “O.K., sure, so what exactly are those restrictions, so we can know them and figure out how to deal with them? As long as we don’t define what those limits are, then we can expand them to the point where women, practically speaking, cannot work.” In Mr. Morsi’s political program, called “The Renaissance,” there is an emphasis on a woman’s “authentic role as wife, mother and purveyor of generations.” The program then makes recommendations to safeguard family life; foremost among them are premarital classes for youths. Free from the restrictions of the government of Hosni Mubarak, which outlawed the Brotherhood, the movement’s social outreach programs have mushroomed since Mr. Morsi’s election. In less than a year, Family House expanded from a single office to 18 branches around Egypt and is developing a plan to encourage all couples to attend. At the group’s headquarters, in the densely populated Cairo neighborhood of Nasr City, Mr. Abou Salama walked into a spacious room where the front seats were for men and the back seats were for women. He lectured on qualities to seek in a partner, getting acquainted under parental supervision, dealing with in-laws and consummating marriage. In his social paradigm, understanding that the woman was created to be an obedient wife and mother and that the man was created to fend for his family holds the secret to a happy marriage. “I want you to be the flower that attracts a bee to make honey, not the trash that attracts flies and dirt,” Mr. Abou Salama said as the women listened intently.

"Senate Confirmation Hearing: Hillary Clinton","Advertisement JAN. 13, 2009  KERRY: Well, good morning, everyone. We welcome you all here. We're delighted to welcome Senator Clinton, secretary of state designate. I think every member of the committee believes very strongly that in Senator Clinton we have a nominee who is extraordinarily capable and smart, an individual with the global stature and influence to help shape events. She will take office on a first-name basis with numerous heads of state, but also with billions of people in every corner of the globe, those billions of people that the Obama administration hopes to reach, inspire, and influence. Her presence overseas will send a strong signal immediately that America is back. This morning, we look forward to a good, healthy dialogue, and, over the coming years, we particularly look forward to a strong, close, cooperative, working relationship. This is an historic moment for this committee. For the first time in American history, one of our members will be sworn in as president and another one as vice president. Before any of the newer members of our committee get too excited about future prospects, let Dick Lugar, Chris Dodd, and myself -- and perhaps even Hillary will join in this -- in saying trust us, it ain't automatic. Advertisement (LAUGHTER) For me, it is a particularly special and personal privilege to be sitting here, having testified before Chairman Fulbright in 1971 and having worked closely with the chairmen since who have set a strong example for this committee's ability to contribute to our security. Advertisement And this morning, we should remember one chairman in particular. Last week, Dick Chris, Sheldon, and I attended memorial services for Claiborne Pell in Rhode Island. President Clinton, who first met Chairman Pell when he was a college student interning on this committee, spoke movingly at the funeral. And today, I know we all join together in expressing our gratitude for Chairman Pell's exemplary service. His commitment to bipartisanship and multilateralism remains the guidepost by which this committee will continue its efforts. I'm privileged also to follow in the more recent footsteps of two respected chairmen and good friends. Vice President-elect Biden and I first ran for office together in 1972, and we grew up together in politics. I know Joe and his family well, as many of the members of this committee do. I value his friendship, and the country will come to value the wisdom and strength which he brings to the vice presidency. The committee is grateful for his leadership. I also have the good fortune as chairman to have beside me as ranking member the senior-most Republican in the Senate, a Noble Peace Prize nominee for his groundbreaking nonproliferation work and a trusted, thoughtful voice in our national security dialogue. Senator Lugar, I look forward to working with you in the same cooperative way that Senator Biden did and others have in the past, and I know that that will characterize the work of this committee as we go forward, and I could not have a better partner, and I thank you for that. If we do our job correctly, as we begin a new presidency and a new Congress, we stand on the brink of a new era of American diplomacy with great potential for significant, if not transformational, steps forward across the globe, and I look forward to working with Secretary Clinton to seize that potential. In the last seven years, we have spent the treasure of our nation -- young American soldiers, first and foremost, and billions of dollars -- to fight terrorism, and yet grave questions remain as to whether or not we have chosen our battles correctly, pursued the right strategy, defined the right goals. That we are engaged in fighting a global insurgency is beyond doubt, but our task is to define the method and means of our response more effectively, and no challenge will be greater in the days ahead than to get this right. Advertisement Pakistan and Afghanistan are definitively the front line of our global counterterrorism efforts. Having visited several times recently, it is clear that no amount of additional troops will succeed absent the effective instruments of a functioning state. We face a gargantuan task, and to be successful, I believe we must fundamentally redefine our approach. We went into Afghanistan to deny Al Qaida sanctuary. Our goals must be defined by our original mission, by the regional security context, and by the tribal decentralized nature of Afghan society. I'm eager to hear Senator Clinton's thoughts on the road ahead in Afghanistan. Nor should anyone believe that Iraq is a completed task. Despite the Status of Forces Agreement that sets out a schedule for reduction of U.S. forces, Sunni and Shia tensions, the unresolved status of Kirkuk, the distribution of oil revenues, and setbacks to political reconciliation each threaten to upend our fragile progress, and they will require active diplomatic engagement by Secretary of State Clinton and the rest of the Obama administration with Iraq's government and particularly with its neighbors. Iraq, as well as Iran, Syria, the West Bank, and Gaza, all require an approach that recognizes the interconnectedness of each of these challenges. We look forward to working with the administration and the Secretary Clinton on a significantly expanded and vigorous diplomatic effort. In the age of catastrophic terrorism, it is also urgent -- and I know Senator Lugar joins me in expressing this -- urgent that we restore America's leadership on nonproliferation. Whatever our differences, we must reengage with Russia on nuclear security, specifically the START Treaty. It is my hope that we will embrace deep reciprocal cuts in our nuclear arsenals, and I'm eager to hear Senator Clinton's thoughts on this matter. Consistent with our security needs, I believe we should set a goal of no more than 1,000 deployed warheads, and that goal should be just the beginning. We should also lay the groundwork for ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. The last eight years have resulted in increased suspicion of our motives abroad, especially in the Muslim world where we must do much more to reduce the prevalent and costly perception of an assault on Islam. It is vital that we redouble our efforts to find common ground, including through interfaith dialogue. KERRY: We must integrate all of the disparate elements of our national power into a single unified effort, and I agree with Secretary Gates that we need a State Department with more resources and greater capacity to deal with 21st-century challenges in conflict zones and in weak and failing states. Advertisement I was heartened to hear Senator Clinton signal her desire to radically improve our diplomatic capacity and finally give the State Department the tools it needs to put civilian functions back in civilian hands, and she can count on our support in that effort. She can also count on our support in efforts to reengage with Latin America and recognize how crucial renewed and expanded relationships with Russia and China are to our overall goals. I believe, Madam Secretary-designate, that China offers us extremely important opportunities for a more productive partnership, and we need to approach that relationship with greater respect for and understanding of our common interests. Before turning to Senator Lugar, let me just say one thing about global climate change. Many today do not see global climate change as a national security threat, but it is profoundly so. And the consequences of our inaction grow more serious by the day. In Copenhagen this December, we have a chance to forge a treaty that will profoundly affect the conditions of life on our planet itself. A resounding message from the recent Climate Change Conference in Poland was that the global community is looking overwhelmingly to our leadership. This committee will be deeply involved in crafting a solution that the world can agree to and that the Senate can ratify, and, as we proceed, the lesson of Kyoto must remain clear in our minds: All countries must be part of the solution. Each of these challenges present major opportunities for a new administration and for a new secretary of state. After the polarization of the last eight years, diplomacy must be directed domestically as well. Senator Clinton's record in the Senate shows her to be an alliance builder in the finest traditions of this body. She has repeatedly sought out the best people, the best ideas, and the common ground upon which solutions could be found. KERRY: While the committee still has some questions with respect to the fund-raising activities of the Clinton Foundation, I'm pleased that Senator Clinton will have an opportunity today to address them beyond the ways in depth that they have already been addressed. I understand that Senator Lugar will be speaking to this issue in greater detail, and we look forward to hearing the senator's responses. Let me just say personally that in the year 2000, I had the privilege of joining the then first lady and her husband on the first visit by an American president to Viet Nam after the normalization of relations. Advertisement I've seen Senator Clinton's diplomatic acumen up close. I saw her immense curiosity, her quick and impressive grasp of detail, and her authoritative approach, all of which will serve her will in this new undertaking. Hillary Clinton has shown the intelligence to navigate the complex issues that we face, the toughness and the tireless work ethic that this job will require, the stature to project America's world leadership, and the alliance building -- at home and abroad -- that will be vital to our success in the years ahead. As senator, Hillary has earned the respect of her colleagues, Democrat and Republican alike, and we are honored to welcome her here today to our committee for confirmation as America's next secretary of state. Senator Lugar? LUGAR: Mr. Chairman, I congratulate you on taking the gavel and wish you every success. And we appreciate the very gracious comments you have made about previous chairmen. And I join you especially in your tribute to our former colleague Senator Pell, whose life we celebrated together last week. It's a great pleasure to welcome Senator Hillary Clinton to the Foreign Relations Committee. Those of you who have served with her during the past eight years can attest to her impressive skills, her compassion, her collegiality. I've enjoyed the opportunity to work with her in the Senate. I look forward to the prospect of much more frequent collaboration when she is secretary of state. I also want to congratulate Senator Kerry on the assumption of chairmanship of this committee. My first hearing as chairman of the committee in 1985 was one of the proudest moments of my career. And I'm sure Senator Kerry is feeling the gravity as well as the joy of this historic occasion. And I want to thank him and his staff for their graciousness during the last several weeks. It's been a pleasure to work with them. And I look forward to all that we can achieve together under Senator Kerry's chairmanship. I've frequently said the foremost criteria for selecting a national security cabinet official should be whether the nominee is a big leaguer who has achieved extraordinary accomplishments, is well known to the world, understands both process and policy, and can command global respect. Advertisement In Senator Clinton, President-elect Obama has boldly chosen the epitome of a big leaguer. Her qualifications for the post are remarkable. Her presence at the helm of the State Department could open unique opportunities for United States diplomacy and could bolster efforts to improve foreign attitudes toward the United States. She has a long-standing relationship with many world leaders that could be put to great use in the service of our country. Her time in the Senate has given her a deep understanding of how United States foreign policy can be enriched by establishing a closer relationship between the executive and legislative branches. She is fully prepared to engage the world on a myriad of issues that urgently require attention. During the last six years, this committee has held more hearings than any other committee in the Senate, and we have tried to come to grips with issues involving Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran, North Korea, Russia, the Middle East peace process, Africa, the Western Hemisphere, the NATO Alliance, non-proliferation, foreign assistance reform, the State Department budget, and numerous other priorities. All of these challenges will continue to occupy Senator Clinton as secretary of state. I would highlight several other points to which I hope the secretary will very high priority in addition to the ongoing crises that will press for her attention. First, it is vital that the START Treaty with Russia be renewed. When the Senate gave its consent to ratification to the Moscow Treaty in 2002, it did so knowing that the United States could rely on START Treaty's verification regime. It provides important assurances to both sides. At the time, this committee was assured that extension of START was a very high priority. Unfortunately, little progress has been made, and the treaty will expire in 11 months. In other words, the conceptual underpinning of our strategic relationship with Russia depends upon something that is about to expire. Such an outcome will be seen as weakening the international nonproliferation regime. Second, energy security must be given a much higher priority in our diplomacy. Earlier this month, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin ordered a cutoff in natural gas supplies that struck allies across Europe. And this dispute is only the most recent example of how energy vulnerability constrains our foreign policy options around the world, limiting effectiveness in some cases and forcing our hand in others. I look forward to supporting President-elect Obama in taking the necessary steps to dramatically reduce our domestic dependence on oil. Yet domestic reform alone will not be sufficient to meet the global threats to our national security, our economic health or climate change. Advertisement In my judgment, energy security must be at the top of our agenda with nearly every country. Progress will require personal engagement by the secretary of state. Third, eradicating global hunger must be embraced as both a humanitarian and national security imperative. Precipitous food price increases that occurred in 2007 and 2008 created havoc in many parts of the world, causing riots in some 19 countries and plunging an additional 75 million people into poverty and increased vulnerability to malnourishment. Nearly 1 billion people are presently food insecure. It is predicted the world's population will grow to such an extent that by 2050 current food production will need to double in order to meet demand. There is no reason why people should be hungry when we have the knowledge, the technology and the resources to make everyone food secure. The United States is uniquely situated to help the world feed itself and has the opportunities to recast its image by making the eradication of hunger a centerpiece of United States foreign policy. LUGAR: And with these issues in mind, it's especially important we move forward with Senator Clinton's nomination. President-elect Obama has expressed his confidence in her, and he deserves to have his secretary of state in place at the earliest opportunity. The main issue related to Senator Clinton's nomination that has occupied the committee has been the review of how her service as secretary of state can be reconciled with the sweeping global activities of President Bill Clinton and the Clinton Foundation. To this end, the Obama transition and the Clinton Foundation completed a memorandum of understanding outlining steps designed to minimize potential conflicts of interest. I share the president-elect's view that the activities of the Clinton Foundation and President Clinton himself should not be a barrier to Senator Clinton's service. But I also share the view implicitly recognized by the memorandum of understanding that the work of the Clinton Foundation is a unique complication that will have to be managed with great care and transparency. Advertisement The core of the problem is that foreign governments and entities may perceive the Clinton Foundation as a means to gain favor with the secretary of state. Although neither Senator Clinton nor President Clinton has a personal financial stake in the foundation, obviously its work benefits their legacy and their public service priorities. There is nothing wrong with this, and President Clinton is deservedly proud of the Clinton Foundation's good work in addressing HIV/AIDS, global poverty, climate change, and other pressing problems. But the Clinton Foundation exists as a temptation for any foreign entity or government that believes it could curry favor through a donation. It also sets up potential perception problems with any action taken by the secretary of state in relation to foreign givers or their countries. The nature of the secretary of state post makes recusal from specific policy decisions almost impossible, since even localized U.S. foreign policy activities can ripple across countries and continents. Every new foreign donation that is accepted by the foundation comes with the risk it will be connected in the global media to a proximate State Department policy or decision. Foreign perceptions are incredibly important to United States foreign policy, and mistaken impressions or suspicions can deeply affect the actions of foreign governments toward the United States. Moreover, we do not want our own government's deliberations distracted by avoidable controversies played out in the media. The bottom line is that even well-intentioned foreign donations carry risks for United States foreign policy. The only certain way to eliminate this risk going forward is for the Clinton foundation to forswear new foreign contributions when Senator Clinton becomes secretary of state. I recommend this straightforward approach as the course most likely to avoid pitfalls that could disrupt United States foreign policy or inhibit Senator Clinton's own activities as secretary of state. Alternatively, the Clinton Foundation and the Obama transition have worked in good faith to construct a more complex approach based on disclosure and ethics reviews that would allow the foundation the prospect of continuing to accept foreign donations deemed not to have the appearance of a conflict of interest. Advertisement The agreement requires, among other measures, the disclosure of all the foundation donors up to this point and annual disclosure of donations going forward and a State Department ethics review process that would evaluate proposed donations from foreign governments and governmental entities. All of these are positive steps. But we should be clear that this agreement is a beginning and not an end. It is not a guarantee against conflict of interest or its appearance. And for the agreement to succeed, the parties must make the integrity of United States foreign policy their first principle of implementation. For this reason, the requirements for transparency in the memorandum of understanding should be considered a minimum standard. I'm hopeful the Clinton Foundation and the Obama administration will go further to ensure that the vital business of United States foreign policy upon which the security of our country rests is not encumbered by perceptions arising from donations to the foundation. If there is a slightest doubt about the appearance that a donation might create, the foundation should not take that donation. If there are issues about how a donation should be disclosed, the issue should be resolved by disclosing the donation sooner and with as much specificity as possible. Operational inconveniences for the foundation or a reduction in some types of donations that have been accepted in the past are small prices to pay when balanced against the serious business of United States foreign policy that affects the security of every American. With this in mind, I have suggested several additional transparency measures that could be embraced by the Clinton Foundation and the Obama administration going forward. Because time is limited I will not discuss each one explicitly now, but I have provided a background sheet -- Attachment A -- that outlines these measures. And my understanding is the Clinton Foundation has already accepted the fourth item listed. The willingness of all parties to voluntarily implement these additions would strengthen the commitment to transparency and at least partially mitigate the risk inherent in foreign contributions. I believe that every member of this committee will seek ways to support Senator Clinton's work as secretary of state. I am certain every member wants her to succeed. We have the opportunity through the leadership of President-elect Obama and Senator Clinton to establish a new foreign policy path that will greatly benefit the security and prosperity of the United States. And I look forward to our discussion with our esteemed colleague today. I applaud her willingness to take on the role of secretary of state at a very difficult moment in history. Advertisement And I thank you, Mr. Chairman. KERRY: Well, I thank you, Senator Lugar. And let me just say that, for the record, first of all the attachment will be made part of the record with the statement. And secondly, I think it's fair to say that Senator Lugar is not speaking from a partisan's perspective, but I think he is really expressing a view of the committee as a whole. And we look forward to having a good discussion about this. If I could just say to my colleagues that what we're going to do is I'm about -- I want to take a personal privilege to let Senator Dodd say something because he has to go chair a hearing. But we're going to have a 10-minute round. We have not yet, obviously, been able to have our organizational meeting, so we'll have a chance to talk about procedures going forward. KERRY: But today we will go, as we have in the past, as a matter of seniority. My hope is we can get a full round, maybe plus, before we break. We will take a break at about 12:45 until 2 o'clock, thereabouts, and that's by agreement with Senator Clinton and some other needs that we have to attend to. We also intend to try to do the business meeting in order to try to expedite this nomination Thursday morning, when we have another hearing on another nominee. So we look forward to trying to have the cooperation of everybody to be able to do that. I think Senator Lugar, again, spoke to the committee and expressing our desire to have a secretary of state in place and ready to go as rapidly as possible and, obviously, on Tuesday of next week. That said, let me turn to Senator Dodd. I know, Senator Schumer, you've being very patient and we appreciate it. Advertisement Senator Dodd? DODD: Well, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I apologize to my colleagues, but as we're in the midst of all of this, it's sort of a New York day. I'll leave here and Shaun Donovan is the nominee to be the new secretary of HUD and I have to chair that hearing as chairman of the Banking Committee. Mr. Duncan is the designee to be the new secretary of education. I'm the ranking Democrat on that committee, as well. So we have a busy day in front of us. I'm going to be very, very brief and ask consent, Mr. Chairman, that a longer statement be included in the record. But I wanted to, first of all, commend you, Mr. Chairman. This is a -- you are so well suited to this job as chairman of this committee, your background and experience, your knowledge of these issues, and I'm very excited about your leadership of this committee. And let me, as well, underscore the point you made about Claiborne Pell and Dick Lugar, as well, Joe Biden. We've been blessed in this committee over the years with some remarkable people to chair this committee and you're going to carry on in that tradition. Let me also welcome and congratulate my wonderful friend from New York, the nominee, Senator Clinton. I've worked with her over the years and I am very excited, as all of us are, about your nomination and look forward to having a very strong and healthy relationship between the State Department and this committee. I don't think it's overstating the case to say that you will be inheriting some of the largest and most difficult international challenges the United States has faced in over half a century and, as has been said by Senator Kerry and Senator Lugar, the threat of terrorism, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction still loom large and our own prestige, influence and elements of our soft power have been questioned, and as our commitment to the rule of law. And while these issue and others, including the crisis in Gaza and our relationships with China and Russia, are very much at the forefront of our minds, I want to just raise one issue briefly before departing and hopefully getting back later in the day to discuss this with you further. But as I mentioned, I'm chairman of the Banking Committee and the one issue that overlaps almost all of this, in many ways, is the global economic crisis. While we're very much aware of it here in our own country, with the problems we're grappling with every single day, I think most are aware today this is not just a localized problem in the sense that every other issue we are dealing with will be affected by our ability to grapple effectively with the economic crisis we face. Advertisement This crisis has inflicted seriously and wide-reaching damage to which no nation is immune. As important as our domestic response is to this crisis, I think it is particularly critical that we developed a well coordinated international strategy to deal with what, in many ways, as fundamental to our own well being as our physical security, our economic security. Both the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, as well as the Senate Committee on Banking, maintain jurisdiction over a wide array of international economic issues and my intent is, along with Senator Kerry and Senator Lugar, to work together on these issues. We have jurisdiction in the Banking Committee over many of the international institutions and, yet, obviously, it's a matter of deep concern to this committee, as well. So we need to coordinate our activities and I raise that because the jurisdictional overlap is similar to the jurisdictional overlap that currently exists within the executive branch, the State Department and the Treasury Department. Senator Clinton, you and I have discussed this issue briefly and had a chance to talk about it, but in order to implement an effective international policy response to the economic crisis, we first must ensure that there's a coordinated leadership on this issue. And so I raise that point before leaving. You may address it in your statement. I'm not sure if you're going to or not, but it's tremendously important. And I certainly look forward to working with Senator Kerry and you and others on these issues and how we can coordinate our activities. But again, I welcome you. I'm excited about your leadership role as the new secretary of state. I commend you and Senator -- President-elect Obama for doing this. There's been a lot of speculation about having two candidates who sought the presidency taking on these responsibilities. I think it says volumes about both of you. The idea that this president-elect is not in any way threatened by a significant challenger to ask her to be a part of his team and your willingness to step up and accept that challenge, as well, is, I think, what makes this country so unique in the eyes of the world. Advertisement So I wish you the very best. KERRY: Thank you, Senator Dodd, for those arm and generous comments and we appreciate it, and we very much look forward, obviously, to working very closely with you on that. The international and global economic linkages nowadays have really transformed foreign policy and we're already looking within our staff structure on the committee for ways to try to address that more effectively. Senator Schumer and Senator Clinton, you've both been very patient and we appreciate it enormously. Let me, as I introduce you, Senator Schumer, also welcome Chelsea. We are delighted to have you here. Your mother said, as we were walking across the dais, that she wished you weren't sitting behind her, but she could look at you up here. So since your father served as an intern on this committee, maybe we can make you an intern for a day, chairman's prerogative. So if you want to come up here later and look out, we're happy to welcome you. So, Senator Schumer, thanks so much for joining here. Happy to have you. (APPLAUSE) Is that for Senator Schumer or for Chelsea? SCHUMER: Chelsea, for sure. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and it is a true honor to be here. I want to thank you and Ranking Member Lugar, all the members of the committee for the opportunity for the honor, the true honor of introducing my friend and colleague, Senator Clinton. Before I do, I want to congratulate you, Mr. Chairman, on your ascension to the chairmanship and I share the confidence of many that you'll be a truly great chairman of this committee and look forward to watching the committee work. Now, colleagues, I've known Hillary a long time and I'm confident that there is no one -- no one -- who would better serve our country and the world as the next secretary of state. Advertisement We're in a new era. The world is yearning for strong, but consultative American leadership and foreign policy. Hillary Rodham Clinton, as secretary of state, is exactly the right person at the right time. Hillary has spent more time under the national political spotlight than almost anyone, first as first lady, then in her race for the New York Senate seat, her subsequent eight years at Senate, and then her historic victories in her campaign for the democratic presidential nomination, and now, finally, as President-elect Obama's choice for secretary of state. Through all of this time, Hillary has demonstrated the equanimity, prudence, the fortitude that have made her an exceptional leader and public servant. SCHUMER: In her years as first lady, Senator Clinton was one of the country's most important and best loved ambassadors. She traveled to over 80 countries, meeting with heads of state from the Czech Republic to Nepal. She served as a representative to the United Nations, addressing forums around the world. She has negotiated aid packages in Asia, pushed democratic reforms in the former Soviet Bloc, and promoted peace plans in northern Ireland and Serbia. But Hillary didn't just meet with world leaders. She has met with private citizens around the world whose lives are shaped by international decisions. She has met survivors of the Rwandan genocide. She has met with advocates for social justice and women's rights in Pakistan and with the families of children kidnapped in Uganda. And after serving her country eight years as first lady, when most people would retire, Hillary stepped up and has served as a vital and powerful advocate on behalf of the people of New York, going from the White House to White Plains. Advertisement Hillary has continued to show just as much acumen as in her dealings with national and global leaders as she shows empathy and interest in the needs of private individuals around New York. In all of her many roles as a public servant, Hillary has always shown the insight to see the heart of a problem, the courage to tackle it, and the talent to solve it. What could be a better description of what we need as secretary of state? And no matter how abstract the problem, no matter how esoteric the question, Hillary has never once forgotten the peoples whose lives and happiness depend on her work. Hillary, you've dedicated your career to improving the lives of the least fortunate. Since your work 30 years ago with the Children's Defense Fund, you've come a long way, but you've always retained your tireless efforts to better the world. For me, it's been a pleasure and a privilege serving with you in the Senate and I will sorely miss you. But I wish you the best of luck and I know that you will be a brilliant secretary of state. KENNEDY: Thank you very much, Senator Schumer. And I know we need to excuse you post cog to go about other duties and I know that our Republican colleagues are thrilled that those duties no longer include being chairman of the Campaign Committee. SCHUMER: Mr. Chairman, it is, as Chris Dodd mentioned, a New York day and I have to go introduce Shaun Donovan at the Banking Committee. KENNEDY: We understand that. Thank you so much. SCHUMER: Thank you, colleagues. I appreciate it very much. Advertisement KENNEDY: Well, Madam Secretary-designate, we are, again, really delighted to welcome you here and we look forward to your testimony and have a chance to get some questions in. Thanks so much. CLINTON: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And as he's leaving, I want to thank Senator Schumer for that generous introduction and even more for his support and our partnership over so many years. He's been a valued and trusted colleague, a friend and a tribute to the people of New York whom he has served with such distinction. Mr. Chairman, I join in offering my congratulations as you take on this new role. You've traveled quite a distance from that day back in 1971 when you testified here as a young Vietnam veteran. You have never faltered in your care and concern for our nation, its foreign policy and its future, and America is in good hands with you leading this committee. And, Senator Lugar, I look forward to working with you on a wide range of issues, especially those of greatest concern to you, including the Nunn-Lugar initiative. And let me say a word to Senator Voinovich because of his announcement yesterday. I want to commend you for your service to the people of Ohio and I ask for your help in the next two years on the management issues that you have long championed. It is an honor and a privilege to be here this morning as President-elect Obama's nominee for secretary of state. I am deeply grateful for the trust and keenly aware of the responsibility that the president-elect has placed in me to serve our country and to serve our people at a time of such grave dangers and great possibilities. If confirmed, I will accept the duties of the office with gratitude, humility and firm determination to represent the United States as energetically and faithfully as I can. At the same time, I must confess that sitting across the table from so many colleagues brings me sadness, too. I love the Senate and if you confirm me for this new role, it will be hard to say goodbye to so many members, Republicans and Democrats, whom I have come to know, admire and respect deeply, and to this institution where I have been so proud to serve on behalf of the people of New York through some very difficult days over the past eight years. But I assure you I will be in frequent consultation and conversation with the members of this committee, the House Foreign Affairs Committee, the Appropriations Committees, and with Congress as a whole, and I look forward to working with my good friend, Vice President-elect Biden, who has been a valued colleague and a very valued chairman of this committee. For me, consultation is not a catch word. It is a commitment. The president-elect and I believe that we must return to the time honored principle of bipartisanship in our foreign policy, an approach that has served our nation well. I look forward to working with all of you to renew America's leadership through diplomacy that enhances our security, advances our interests, and reflects our values. Today, our nation and our world face great peril from ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to the continuing threats posed by terrorist extremists, the spread of weapons of mass destruction, from the dangers of climate change to pandemic disease, from financial meltdowns to worldwide poverty. The 70 days since the presidential election offer fresh evidence of these challenges, new conflict in Gaza, terrorist attacks in Mumbai, mass killings and rapes in the Congo, cholera in Zimbabwe, record high greenhouse gases and rapidly melting glaciers, and even an ancient form of terror -- piracy -- asserting itself in modern form off the Horn of Africa. CLINTON: Always and especially in the crucible of these global challenges, our overriding duty is to protect and advance America's security, interests and values, to keep our people, our nation and our allies secure, to promote economic growth and shared prosperity at home and abroad, and to strengthen America's position of global leadership so we remain a positive force in the world, whether in working to preserve the health of our planet or expanding opportunity for people on the margins whose progress and prosperity will add to our own. Our world has undergone an extraordinary transformation in the last two decades. In 1989, a wall fell and old barriers began to crumble after 40 years of a Cold War that had influenced every aspect of our foreign policy. By 1999, the rise of more democratic and open societies, the expanding reach of world markets, and the explosion of information technology had made globalization the word of the day. For most people, it had primarily an economic connotation, but, in fact, we were already living in a profoundly interdependent world in which old rules and boundaries no longer held fast, a world in which both the promise and the peril of the 21st century could not be contained by national borders or vast distances. Economic growth lifted more people out of poverty faster than at any time in our history, but economic crises can sweep across the globe even more quickly. A coalition of nations stopped ethnic cleansing in the Balkans, but the conflict in the Middle East continues to inflame tensions from Africa to Asia. Non-state actors fight poverty, improve health, and expand education in the poorest parts of the world, while other non-state actors traffic in drugs, children, and women and kill innocent civilians across the globe. Now, in 2009, the clear lesson of the last 20 years is that we must both combat the threats and seize the opportunities of our interdependence, and to be effective in doing so, we must build a world with more partners and fewer adversaries. America cannot solve the most pressing problems on our own, and the world cannot solve them without America. The best way to advance America's interests in reducing global threats and seizing global opportunities is to design and implement global solutions. That isn't a philosophical point. This is our reality. The president-elect and I believe that foreign policy must be based on a marriage of principles and pragmatism, not rigid ideology, on facts and evidence, not emotion or prejudice. Our security, our vitality, and our ability to lead in today's world oblige us to recognize the overwhelming facts of our interdependence. I believe that American leadership has been wanting, but is still wanted. We must use what has been called smart power, the full range of tools at our disposal -- diplomatic, economic, military, political, legal, and cultural -- picking the right tool or combination of tools for each situation. With smart power, diplomacy will be the vanguard of our foreign policy. This is not a radical idea. The Ancient Roman poet Terence declared that "In every endeavor, the seemly course for wise men is to try persuasion first." The same truth binds wise women as well. I assure you that if I am confirmed, the State Department will be firing on all cylinders to provide forward-thinking, sustained diplomacy in every part of the world, applying pressure wherever it may be needed, but also looking for opportunities: exerting leverage; cooperating with our military and other agencies of government; partnering with non-governmental organizations, the private sector, and international organizations; using modern technologies for public outreach; empowering negotiators who can protect our interests while understanding those of our negotiating partners. Diplomacy is hard work, but when we work hard, diplomacy can work, not just to defuse tensions, but to achieve results that advance our security interests and values. Secretary Gates, as the chairman said, has been particularly eloquent in articulating the importance of diplomacy. As he notes, it's not often that a secretary of defense makes the case for adding resources to the State Department and elevating the role of the diplomatic corps. Thankfully Secretary Gates is more concerned about having a unified, agile, and effective U.S. strategy than in spending precious time and energy on petty turf wars. As he has stated, "Our civilian institutions of diplomacy and development have been chronically undermanned and underfunded for far too long." That is a statement that I can only heartily say amen to. President-elect Obama has emphasized that the State Department must be fully empowered and funded to confront multidimensional challenges from thwarting terrorism to spreading health and prosperity in places of human suffering, and I will speak in greater detail about that in a moment. We should also use the United Nations and other institutions whenever possible and appropriate. Both Democratic and Republican presidents have understood that these institutions, when they work well, enhance our influence, and when they don't work well, as in the cases of Darfur and the farce of Sudan's election to the former U.N. Commission on Human Rights, we should work with like-minded friends to make them more effective. We will lead with diplomacy because that's the smart approach, but we also know that military force will sometimes be necessary, and we will rely on it to protect our people and our interests when and where needed as a last resort. All the while, we must remember that to promote our interests around the world, America must be an exemplar of our values. Senator Isakson made the point to me the other day that our nation must lead by example rather than edict. Our history has shown that we are most effective when we see the harmony between our interests abroad and our values at home. Our first secretary of state, Thomas Jefferson, subscribed to that view, reminding us across the centuries, "The interests of a nation when well understood will be found to coincide with their moral duties." Senator Lugar, I'm going to borrow your words here, too. As you said, "The United States cannot feed every person, lift every person out of poverty, cure every disease, or stop every conflict, but our power and status have conferred upon us a tremendous responsibility to humanity." Of course, we must be realistic. Even under the best of circumstances, our nation cannot solve every problem or meet every global need. We don't have unlimited time, treasure, or manpower, especially with our own economy faltering and our budget deficits growing. So, to fulfill our responsibility to our children, to protect and defend our nation, while honoring our values, we have to establish priorities. I'm not trying to mince words here. As my colleagues in the Senate know, establishing priorities means making tough choices. Because these choices are so important to the American people, we must be disciplined in evaluating them, weighing the costs and consequences of action or inaction, gauging the probability of success, and insisting on measurable results. Right after I was nominated, a friend told me, "The world has so many problems. You've got your work cut out for you." Well, I agree, but I don't get up every morning thinking only about the threats and dangers we face. In spite of all the adversity and complexity, there are so many opportunities for America out there, calling forth the optimism and can-do spirit that has marked our progress for more than two centuries. Too often, we see the ills that plague us more clearly than the possibilities in front of us, but it is the real possibility of progress, of that better life free from fear and want and discord, that offers our most compelling message to the rest of the world. I've had the chance to lay out and submit my views on a broad array of issues and written responses to questions from the committee. So this statement will only outline some of the major challenges we face and the major opportunities we see as well. First, President-elect Obama is committed to responsibly ending the war in Iraq and employing a broad strategy in Afghanistan that reduces threats to our safety and enhances the prospects of stability and peace. Right now, our men and women in uniform, our diplomats, and our aid workers are risking their lives in these two countries. They have done everything we have asked of them and more. But, over time, our larger interests will be best served by safely and responsibly withdrawing our troops from Iraq, supporting a transition to full Iraqi responsibility for their sovereign nation, rebuilding our overtaxed military, and reaching out to other nations to help stabilize the region and employ a broader arsenal of tools to fight terrorism. We will use all the elements of our power -- diplomacy, development, and defense -- to work with those in Afghanistan and Pakistan who want to root out Al Qaida, the Taliban, and other violent extremists who threaten them as well as us in what President-elect Obama has called the central front in the fight against terrorism. As we focus on Iraq, Pakistan, and Afghanistan, we must also actively pursue a strategy of smart power in the Middle East that addresses the security needs of Israel and the legitimate political and economic aspirations of the Palestinians; that effectively challenges Iran to end its nuclear weapons program and its sponsorship of terror; and persuade both Iran and Syria to abandon their dangerous behavior and become constructive regional actors; and that also strengthens our relationship with Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, other Arab states, along with Turkey and our partners in the Gulf, to involve them in securing a lasting peace in the region. As intractable as the Middle East problems may seem -- and many presidents, including my husband, have spent years trying to work out a resolution -- we cannot give up on peace. The president-elect and I understand and are deeply sympathetic to Israel's desire to defend itself under the current conditions and to be free of shelling by Hamas rockets. However, we have also been reminded of the tragic humanitarian cost of conflict in the Middle East and pained by the suffering of Palestinian and Israeli civilians. This must only increase our determination to seek a just and lasting peace agreement that brings real security to Israel; normal and positive relations with its neighbors; independence, economic progress, and security to the Palestinians in their own states. We will exert every effort to support the work of Israelis and Palestinians who seek that result. It is critical not only to the parties involved, but to undermining the forces of alienation and violent extremism around the world. For terrorism, we must have a comprehensive strategy, levering intelligence, diplomacy, and military assets to defeat Al Qaida and other terrorist groups by rooting out their networks and drying up their support for violent and nihilistic extremism. The gravest threat that America faces is the danger that weapons of mass destruction will fall into the hands of terrorists. We must curb the spread and use of these weapons -- nuclear, biological, chemical, or cyber -- and prevent the development and use of dangerous new weapons. Therefore, while defending against the threat of terrorism, we will also seize the parallel opportunity to get America back in the business of engaging other nations to reduce nuclear stockpiles. The Nonproliferation Treaty is the cornerstone of the nonproliferation regime, and the United States must exercise leadership needed to shore it up. So we will seek agreements with Russia to secure further reductions in weapons under START, we will work with this committee and the Senate toward ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and we will dedicate efforts to revive negotiations on a verifiable Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty. At the same time, we will continue to work to prevent proliferation in North Korea and Iran, to secure loose nuclear weapons and materials, and to shut down the market for selling them, as Senator Lugar has pushed for so many years. These threats, however, cannot be addressed in isolation. Smart power requires reaching out to both friends and adversaries to bolster old alliances and to forge new ones. That means strengthening the alliances that have stood the test of time, especially with our NATO partners and our allies in Asia. Our alliance with Japan is a cornerstone of American policy in Asia, essential to maintaining peace and prosperity in the Asia Pacific region, and based on shared values and mutual interests. We also have crucial economic and security partnerships with South Korea, Australia, and other friends in ASEAN. We will build on our economic and political partnership with India, the world's most populous democracy and a nation with growing influence in the world. Our traditional relationships of confidence and trust with Europe will be deepened. Disagreements are inevitable, but on most global issues, we have no more trusted allies. The new administration will reach out across the Atlantic to leaders in France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and others, including and especially the new democracies. President-elect Obama and I seek a future of cooperative engagement with the Russian government on matters of strategic importance while standing strongly for American values and international norms. China is critically important as an actor who will be changing the global landscape. We want a positive and cooperative relationship with China, one (TSXV:IND) where we deepen and strengthen our ties on a number of issues and candidly address differences where they persist. But this is not a one-way effort. Much of what we will do depends on the choices China makes about its future at home and abroad. CLINTON: With both Russia and China we should work together on vital security and economic issues like terrorism, proliferation, climate change, and reforming financial markets. The world is now, as Senator Dodd said, in the crosscurrents of the most severe global economic contraction since the Great Depression. The history of that crisis teaches us the consequences of diplomatic failures and uncoordinated reactions. We have already seen this crisis extend beyond the housing and banking sectors, and our solutions will have to be as wide in scope as the causes themselves, taking into account the complexities of the global economy, the geopolitics, and the continued political and economic repercussions from the damage already done. But here again, as we work to repair the damage we can find new ways of working together. For too long we've merely talked about the need to engage emerging powers in global economic governance. The time to take action is upon us. The recent G-20 meeting that President Bush hosted was a first step. But developing patterns of sustained engagement will take hard work and careful negotiation. We know that emerging markets like China and India, Brazil and South Africa and Indonesia are feeling the effects of the current crisis. And we all stand to benefit, in both the short and long term, if they are part of the solution and become partners in maintaining global economic stability. In our efforts to return to economic growth here in the United States, we have an especially critical need to work more closely with Canada, our largest trading partner, and Mexico, our third largest. Canada and Mexico are also our biggest suppliers of imported energy. More broadly, we must build a deeper partnership with Mexico to address the shared dangers arising from drug trafficking and the challenges along our border, an effort begun this week with the meeting between President-elect Obama and President Calderon. Throughout our hemisphere, we have opportunities to enhance our relationships that will benefit all of us. We will return to a policy of vigorous involvement, partnership even, with Latin America, from the Caribbean to Central America to South America. We share common political, economic, and strategic interests with our friends to the south, as well as many of our citizens who share ancestral and cultural legacies. We're looking forward to working on many issues during the Summit of the Americas in April and taking up the president-elect's call for a new energy partnership around shared technology and new investments in renewable energy. And in Africa the foreign policy objectives of the Obama administration are rooted in security, political, economic and humanitarian interests, including combating Al Qaida's efforts to seek save havens in failed states in the Horn of Africa, helping African nations conserve their natural resources and reaping fair benefits from them, stopping war in the Congo, ending autocracy in Zimbabwe and human devastation in Darfur. But we also intend to support the African democracies like South Africa and Ghana, which just had its second peaceful change of power in a democratic election. We must work hard with our African friends to reach the millennium development goals in health education and economic opportunity. Many significant problems we face will challenge us not only on a bilateral basis but all nations. You, Mr. Chairman, were among the very first in a growing chorus from both parties to recognize that climate change is an unambiguous security threat. At the extreme, it threatens our very existence. But well before that point, it could well incite new wars of an old kind over basic resources like food, water, and arable land. President-elect Obama has said America must be a leader in developing and implementing a global and coordinated effort to climate change. We will participate in the upcoming UN Copenhagen climate conference and a global energy forum and will pursue an energy policy that reduces our carbon emissions while reducing our dependence on foreign oil and gas, fighting climate change and enhancing our economic and energy security. George Marshall noted that our gravest enemies are often not nations or doctrines but hunger, poverty, desperation, and chaos. So to create more friends and fewer enemies, we must find common ground and common purpose with other peoples and nations to overcome hatred, violence, lawlessness, and despair. The Obama administration recognizes that even when we cannot fully agree with some governments we share a bond of humanity with their people. By investing in that common humanity, we advance our common security. Mr. Chairman, you were one of the first, again, to underscore the importance of our involvement in the global AIDS fight. Now, thanks to a variety of efforts, including President Bush's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, as well as the work of NGOs and foundations, the United States enjoys widespread support in public opinion polls in many African countries. Even among Muslim populations in Tanzania and Kenya, America is seen as a leader in the fight against AIDS, malaria, and TB. We have an opportunity to build on this success by partnering with NGOs to help expand health clinics in Africa so more people can have access to lifesaving drugs, fewer mothers transmit HIV to their children, and fewer lives are lost. We can generate more goodwill through other kinds of social investments, again partnering with international organizations and NGOs, to build schools and train teachers. The president-elect supports a global education fund to bolster secular education around the world. I want to emphasize the importance to us of this bottoms-up approach. The president-elect and I believe in this so strongly: Investing in our common humanity through social development is not marginal to our foreign policy but essential to the realization of our goals. More than two billion people worldwide live on less than $2 a day. They're facing rising food prices and widespread hunger. We have to expand civil and political rights in countries that are plagued by poverty, hunger, and disease. But our pleas will fall on deaf ears unless democracy actually improves people's lives while weeding out the corruption that too often stands in the way of progress. Our foreign policy must reflect our deep commitment to help millions of oppressed people around the world. And of particular concern to me is the plight of women and girls, who comprise the majority of the world's unhealthy, unschooled, unfed, and unpaid. If half the world's population remains vulnerable to economic, political, legal and social marginalization, our hope of advancing democracy and prosperity is in serious jeopardy. The United States must be an unequivocal and unwavering voice in support of women's rights in every country on every continent. As a personal aside, I want to mention that President-elect Obama's mother, Ann Dunham, was a pioneer in microfinance in Indonesia. In my own work on microfinance around the world, from Bangladesh to Chile to Viet Nam to South Africa and many other countries, I've seen firsthand how small loans given to poor women to start businesses can raise standards of living and transform local economies. The president-elect's mother had planned to attend a microfinance forum at the Beijing Women's Conference in 1995 that I participated in. Unfortunately, she was very ill and couldn't travel and, sadly, passed away a few months later. But I think it's fair to say that her work in international development, the care and concern she showed for women and for poor people around the world, mattered greatly to her son, our president-elect. And I believe that it has certainly informed his views and his vision. We will be honored to carry on Ann Dunham's work in the years ahead. Mr. Chairman, I know we'll address many issues in the question and answer session. But I want to underscore a final point. Ensuring that our State Department is functioning at its best is absolutely essential to America's success. The president-elect and I believe strongly that we need to invest in our capacity to conduct vigorous American diplomacy, provide the kind of foreign assistance that I've mentioned, reach out to the world, and operate effectively alongside our military. Now, the entire State Department bureaucracy in Thomas Jefferson's day consisted of a chief clerk, three regular clerks and a messenger. And its entire budget was $56,000 a year. But over the past 219 years, the world has certainly changed. Now the department consists of Foreign Service officers, the civil services, and our locally engaged staff, working not only at Foggy Bottom but in offices across our country and in some 260 posts around the world. And USAID carries out its critical development missions in some of the most difficult places on our earth. These public servants are too often the unsung heroes. They are in the trenches putting our policies and values to work in a complicated and dangerous world. Many risk their lives, and some have lost their lives in service to our nation. They need and deserve the resources, training and support to succeed. I know this committee, and I hope the American public, understands that Foreign Service officers and civil service professionals and development experts are doing invaluable work. And it is the work of the American people, whether helping American businesses make inroads in new markets or being on the other end of the phone when someone gets in trouble beyond our shores, needs a passport, needs advice at an embassy, or doing the delicate work of diplomacy and development with foreign governments that leads to arms control and trade agreements, peace treaties and post-conflict reconstruction, standing up for greater human rights and empowerment, broader cultural understanding and building alliances. State Department is a large, multidimensional organization but not the placid, idle bureaucracy that some have suggested. It is an outpost for American values that protects our citizens and safeguards our democratic institutions in times both turbulent and tame. State Department employees offer a lifeline of hope and help, often the only lifeline for people in foreign lands who are oppressed, silenced and marginalized. We must not shortchange them or ourselves. One of my first priorities is to make sure that the State Department and USAID have the resources they need, and I will be back to make the case to the committee for full funding of the president's budget requests. But I will work just as hard to make sure we manage those resources prudently, efficiently and effectively. You know, like most Americans, when I was growing up I never had the chance to travel widely. Most of my early professional career was as a lawyer and an advocate for children and the poor who found themselves disadvantaged here at home. But during the eight years of my husband's presidency and now eight years as the senator from New York, I have been privileged to travel on behalf of our country. And I've had the opportunity to get to know many world leaders. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I've spent time with our military commanders as well as our brave troops. I've immersed myself in a number of military issues. And I've spent many hours with American and non-American aid workers, business men and women, religious leaders, teachers, doctors, nurses, students, volunteers, all who have made it their mission to help other people across the world. And I've seen countless ordinary people in foreign capitals, small towns and rural villages who live in a world far removed from our experiences. In recent years, as other nations have risen to compete for military, economic, and political influence, some have argued that we have reached the end of the American moment in world history. Well, I disagree. Yes, the conventional paradigms have shifted. But America's success has never been solely a function of our power. It has always been rooted in and inspired by our values. With so many troubles here at home and around the world, millions of people are still trying to come to this country, legally and illegally. Why? Because we are guided by unchanging truths: that all people are created equal, that each person has the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. And in these truths we will find, as we have for more than two centuries, the courage, the discipline and the creativity to meet the challenges of this ever-changing world. I am humbled to be a public servant and honored by the responsibility placed on me should I be confirmed by our president- elect who embodies the American dream, not only here at home but far beyond our shores. No matter how daunting the challenges may be, I have a steadfast faith in this country and in our people. And I am proud to be an American at the dawning of this new American moment. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and members of this committee for granting me your time and attention today. I know there's a lot more territory to cover, and I'd be delighted to answer your questions. KERRY: Well, thank you very much, senator, for a very comprehensive and thoughtful statement. And I can tell you, from certainly this senator's perspective, it's wonderful to hear so many of these issues set out as priorities for the new administration. And we're excited about the prospect of working with you in order to implement the policies in greater detail that will support the agenda that you've set out. KERRY: I'd just say to all my colleagues, I think we all know this, that this committee and the Congress, in its role in foreign policy, has been at its strongest when we've been bipartisan and I think the old adage about politics ending at the water's edge with respect to diplomacy and our national security interest is something that would serve us well as a guidepost as we think about the enormity of the choices that we're going to face in the days ahead. We will begin now a ten-minute question round. And in deference to Senator Corker, who has the same obligations as Senator Dodd, since we let Senator Dodd go, we're going to let him go after. Senator Lugar, is that amenable to you? And then we'll go through this. So we'll start the clock running on a ten-minute series of questions. I think, Senator, that in your opening, you've wonderfully covered a broad array of the challenges and the task, obviously, before all of us is really now to try to hone in a little bit, see how these are really going to play out with specific regions and specific countries and challenges. Obviously, one of the most pressing issues we face, and it was underscored in the "New York Times" on Sunday, is a question of Iran's nuclear program and the entire relationship with Iran, which was, needless to say, a subject of discussion throughout the campaign. The time when Iran is going to be capable of producing enough weapons grade uranium to build a bomb, if they choose to, is very fast approaching. The clock is ticking and yet Iran continues to defy the U.N. resolutions, enriching more uranium to reactor grade levels, installing and operating more and more centrifuges, failing to address the concerns of inspectors and so forth. And recent efforts to get though, as you know, failed with respect to the U.N. Security Council. So I would ask you, during the campaign, President-elect Obama said that he would employ, quote, "big carrots and big sticks" to deal with Iran's nuclear program. We do know that there's a significant package of incentives already on the table from the P-5-plus-1 and the prospect of increased Security Council sanctions may be questionable, at best. So could you share with us the thinking at this stage? I know it's early. But can you share with us what additional carrots the administration might have in mind? Why do you believe those might be enough to change Iran's calculations? Are tougher sanctions achievable and how are you and the administration viewing this at this point? CLINTON: Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Obviously, the incoming administration views with great concern the role that Iran is playing in the world, its sponsorship of terrorism, its continuing interference with the functioning of other governments and its pursuit of nuclear weapons. There is an ongoing policy review that the Obama administration has undertaken, but I think, as the president-elect said just this past weekend, our goal will be to do everything we can to pursue, through diplomacy, through the use of sanctions, through creating better coalitions with countries that we believe also have a big stake in preventing Iran from becoming a nuclear weapon power, to try to prevent this from occurring. We are not taking any option off the table at all, but we will pursue a new, perhaps different approach that will become a cornerstone of what the Obama administration believes is an attitude toward engagement that might bear fruit. We have no illusions, Mr. Chairman, that even with a new administration, looking to try to engage Iran in a way that might influence its behavior, that we can predict the results. But the president-elect is committed to that course and we will pursue it. KERRY: Do you believe that tougher U.N. sanctions are available from which to choose and, secondly, are they achievable? CLINTON: You know, it's kind of like the experimenter's bias, in a way. We won't know what we're capable of achieving until we're actually there working on it. We have a commitment to engaging with international organizations in a very intense and ongoing way. We are going to be working with our friends and our adversaries in the United Nations. We're going to be making the case to members of the Security Council who have been either dubious or unwilling to cooperate up until now that a nuclear armed Iran is in no one's interest under any circumstances. So, Mr. Chairman, it's hard to predict how successful we will be, but I promise you our very best efforts in doing all that we can to try to achieve greater international support for sanctions and action that could actually influence the behavior of the Iranian government, the supreme leader and the religious council and the revolutionary guard the Quds Force, because, as you know so well, all these are players. And so our task will be to try to figure out the appropriate and effective pressure that will perhaps lead to us dissuading Iran from going forward. KERRY: Well, I happen to agree with you that it is, in fact, legitimately impossible to be able to determine exactly what options are available until you begin to get into a conversation and begin to see what the play is. But as a matter of fundamental American policy, let me ask you a question. Is it the policy of the incoming administration, as a bottom line of our security interests and our policy, that it is unacceptable that Iran has a weapon under any circumstances and that we will take any steps necessary to prevent that or is it simply not desirable? I think, as you said, it's in no one's interest, which is less than the formation of the prohibition. CLINTON: Well, Mr. President -- the president-elect, Mr. Chairman... KERRY: I'll take that. CLINTON: It was a Freudian slip. The president-elect... KERRY: We're both subject to those, I want you to know. CLINTON: Yes, indeed, indeed, on this subject, especially. The president-elect has said repeatedly it is unacceptable. It is going to be United States policy to pursue diplomacy with all of its multitudinous tools to do everything we can to prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear weapons state. As I also said, no option is off the table. So the president- elect has been very clear that it is unacceptable and that is our premise and that is what we are going to be basing our actions on. KERRY: The Bush administration sent Undersecretary Burns to the last round of those talks, essentially as an observer. Do you plan to send a U.S. representative to engage directly in those kinds of discussions almost immediately? CLINTON: Mr. Chairman, we are looking at a range of possibilities. One very important aspect of the decisions we make is that we engage in consultation with our friends in the region and beyond. We don't want anything I say today or anything the president- elect says to take our friends and allies by surprise. So we cannot tell you with specificity exactly the steps we will take. But I think it's fair to say that the president-elect, as recently as this weekend, has said that we're going to be trying new approaches, because what we've tried has not worked. They are closer to nuclear weapons capacity today than they were. So we're going to be looking broadly, but in consultation. And I want to underscore that, because it's very important that those who have to live in the region, many of whom are allies, Israel and others who have a legitimate set of concerns about Iran's growing power and its use of that power, should know that the Obama administration will be consulting broadly and deeply. So that when we move, we will move in concert insofar as possible. KERRY: Do you plan personally to engage in personal diplomacy with Iranian officials at a high level in the near term? CLINTON: Well, again, Mr. Chairman, I want to wait to determine the exact contours of how we proceed until we're actually in office and have a chance to consult with others, because it is very clear to me that we have not as full a brief as we need on the feelings of many of the important players. We have carefully hued to the president-elect's position. There's one president at a time. We have not spoken with foreign leaders. We have not, in many instances, taken their calls because we want to be very respectful of the ongoing work of the Bush administration. As soon as we are in a position to do so, we will be consulting and we will be setting forth a series of actions and we will be consulting and informing this committee. KERRY: Well, I know you've been very careful about that and I think it's been appropriate and I think a wise course, and I look forward to you being able to get deeply engaged. Last question, just quickly. Last year, six colleagues and I, including Senator Levin, wrote to Secretary Rice urging her to establish an interests section in Tehran. It just seems counterproductive and almost incomprehensible that we're not on the ground in some of these places. We don't have an ambassador in Syria, for instance. We should've. So I would ask you if you have made a decision and will there be -- will you proceed forward to create an interests section in Tehran and immediately put an ambassador back in Syria? CLINTON: Again, Mr. Chairman, these are matters that are part of our policy review and we will turn to them with great diligence and attention as soon as we are able to. KERRY: Well, I hope the question establishes some sense of priority. CLINTON: I think I got your drift, Mr. Chairman. KERRY: Senator Lugar? LUGAR: Mr. Chairman, could you recognize Senator Corker... KERRY: Yes, absolutely. LUGAR: ... then Senator Feingold? You'll do that? KERRY: Yes. Thank you very much. I'd be delighted to do that. LUGAR: It would expedite his work. KERRY: Thank you so much. Senator Corker? CORKER: Thank you, Senator Lugar, I appreciate that. And, Chairman Kerry, I'm glad you're going to be leading this year. I think you're the right person to be doing it at this time and I thank you for your leadership. Madam Secretary-designate, we welcome you. We're always glad to see when one of our own does well and has a real job and certainly welcome your daughter. Along the comments of -- and I think you have tremendous opportunities. You laid out in your opening comment sort of a travelogue of opportunities and I know that many of the opportunities that exist you didn't mention. You mentioned those certainly in Q&A back to us. So the opportunities that you have as secretary of state are just huge and I think you will succeed in that role, I really do. I want to piggyback and not dwell on the comments that Senator Lugar made early on regarding the Clinton Foundation. And I'm just a junior Senator from Tennessee, but it seems to me that everything has seasons and this is your season and I look at the opportunities that you have to influence the world and our place in the world. I look at the resources that our government can bring to that under your leadership and then I look at the foundation and regardless of who's running it and how great it is, it's a speck in relation to the huge magnitude of efforts that you can put forth on behalf of our government. And so without dwelling on the details, I would encourage the steps that Senator Lugar requested to be taken. There's just no need to sully or dampen or anything the tremendous opportunities that you have and I do hope that sometime over the next two weeks, you'll educate us all as to how that's going to be done. But the potential is so vast in the role that you have and so small in the other role, it just seems to me there's no reason whatsoever to have continual press comments and other kinds of things that might take away from, I think, what might be extraordinary efforts on your part. So thank you so much for your service. You know, I noticed, as I've traveled the world in my short tenure here, the State Department, as you mentioned towards the end of your comments, is vast and we have people in tough parts of the world that are carrying out tough duties. CORKER: It's my sense that when Secretary Powell -- Powell was secretary that he really built the department. He understood, being a military person, what it meant to have a culture and for people to have the tools and training and those kinds of things necessary to really exceed in their jobs or to excel in their jobs. I think that's been a little bit lesser the case recently, and -- and I'm not in any way criticizing. It seems to me the secretary of state really has two major responsibilities. One is to be our chief dealmaker, and that's how you get recorded in history, and I know that there'll be many things that you're recorded that way -- that you'll be recorded in that way. But then there's the whole issue of running the department. My sense is that's not probably your -- your basic strength, that you're probably going to see to the other responsibilities, and I wonder if you might educate us as to how you're going to ensure that the department really does have the support, the tools, the culture, the morale necessary to be successful while we're working on the more major accomplishments. CLINTON: Well, Senator Corker, this is to me one of the most important questions because we can talk about all of the good work we'd like to do and how grateful we are to those people who are out there doing it, but if we don't enhance our diplomatic and development efforts and move toward more equilibrium, as Secretary Gates even has said, we will not be as successful as we need to be in promoting our foreign policy. So, to that end, in consultation with the president-elect and the vice president-elect, as well as the leaders of this committee, I decided to fill a position that had not been filled, although it had been created 10 years ago, and that was the deputy for resources and management. And I concluded that that was important because what happens in every government agency, but certainly in the State Department is you get consumed by the crisis of the moment. You have the best intentions to deal with the management challenges, the resource shortages, but the secretary's time and the, you know, top diplomat's time are spent, you know, on Gaza or on Iran or on Russia and the Ukraine pipeline issue. So it seemed to me that in order to really fulfill my responsibility to you and the American people, we needed to have someone whose total job focus was to manage the department, along with the career professionals, to work to manage USAID to be more effective, and to represent the interests of the department as well as the president -- presidential budget here on the Hill when it came to these resource matters. I feel very fortunate that you will be seeing before you for confirmation two extraordinary deputies. The principal deputy filling the role that has been there historically will be Jim Steinberg, a very accomplished foreign policy expert. He's leaving the deanship of the LBJ School at the University of Texas to take on this responsibility. And filling the second deputy position for resources and management will be Jack Lew, a former director of the Office of Management and Budget, someone with deep experience here on Capitol Hill, who is diving into work already, because I want you as well as me to have someone who is accountable and the point person. You know, the argument kind of stops when you say, "Well, what about more training for our -- our Foreign Service officers? What about, you know, more funding for all of the responsibilities from reconstruction and stabilization efforts, the Office on Trafficking, and so much else? How do we do that? How do we do more with less?" We've got to have somebody who will take charge of all those issues, and I really believe, Senator, that this will be a significant step on the way toward putting the State Department on a sounder financial and management footing. CORKER: We have a maze of aid efforts that are underway. Every senator that travels and sees some need authorizes another aid program. I wonder if you would consider, during the first six months you're there, rationalizing that for us and reporting back as to some of those things that need to be done away with. Again, it's -- all are in good intentions, but they seem to water each other down and not have the focus that they might otherwise have. Wondering if you might commit to doing that during some short period of time after you're there. CLINTON: Well, in fact, Senator, that's going to be one of the responsibilities that will given to this second deputy under my direction, to take a look at our existing authorities, to determine what works, what doesn't work, to try to eliminate redundancies, to fill gaps, because, you know, we do have some of those as well, obviously. You know, it -- it matters greatly to me, as it does to the president-elect. These development efforts, these humanitarian commitments by the United States government are often the way we are perceived and frequently to our advantage if they are done correctly. But I think it's fair to say that USAID, our premier aid agency, has been decimated. You know, it has half the staff it used to have. It's turned into more of a contracting agency than an operational agency with the ability to deliver. Yet at the same time, whether I'm talking to Secretary Gates or I'm -- I'm talking to people in the non- governmental organizational world, very often, they will say the same thing, "Well, they've turned to USAID to determine how to implement these programs." So we're going to take a hard look at all of our aid and development effort. Additionally, the Congress has given the State Department a very important responsibility with reconstruction and stabilization. If we're going to move authorities and resources back from the Defense Department to the State Department, we have to be able to function effectively and demonstrate our efficiency. We're at a great disadvantage. I'll give you just a quick example. There's a program that I learned about, of course, on my Senate Foreign -- my Senate Armed Services Committee work called CERP, the Commanders Emergency Resources Program. I remember the first time I went to Iraq in 2003, and I met young captains and majors and -- and lieutenant colonels who were literally handed thousands of dollars of cash and told, "Go get that school open. Go get that road built. Go fix that, you know, sewer problem." And they were doing an incredible job with great flexibility and very little accountability. I came back a believer in the CERP program and advocated for it to continue, but when I contrast that with a development officer or a State Department expert who knows the culture, knows the language, unlike, you know, this very well-meaning and well-trained warrior, and that person can't get $500 to fulfill a development mission that is in service of American security and our national interests, there's a big disconnect. So, you know, Secretary Gates understands it. So we're going to try to better organize and rationalize what we do and build confidence with you and the rest of Congress that we can take on these responsibilities. KERRY: Thanks. Thank you very much, Senator Corker. Senator Feingold? FEINGOLD: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And, of course, my warm congratulations to you on your new position. I look forward to working closely with you and this committee and the incoming Obama administration to reverse much of the foreign policies of the last eight years and to restore America's leadership abroad and security at home, and I would just ask that my full statement be placed in the record. KERRY: Without objection. FEINGOLD: I am very pleased Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton has been nominated to be secretary of state. She's an excellent choice for our most senior diplomat, has a demonstrated record of thinking creatively about the challenges our country faces, and I want to say that she's already shown not only the indication, but, in fact, has shown a willingness on a regular basis to consult with Congress that is refreshing and very welcome as she sets up the operation she's going to have as secretary of state. I'm very, very pleased with that process. And I'd just note before I get into my questions that some of my colleagues have asked about the Clinton Foundation, and I have some questions on that topic, Mr. Chairman, that I will simply submit for the record. But what I'd like to do is -- is to start off with what I think we agree on, and that is that our top national security priority is the global fight against Al Qaida and its affiliates. I was pleased with your reference in your opening statement to its efforts of Al Qaida in places like Africa, how we allocate our resources, the tools used, in this struggle is key to winning this fight, and without a more global and comprehensive approach, we will be unable to make our country or the world a safer place. Now the current administration's decision to focus so many of our resources on Iraq at the expense of other areas has, I think, been a tragic mistake in this regard. So I would ask you -- and I know you mentioned this issue first -- to please share your vision of how you will follow up on President-elect Obama's pledge to redeploy the bulk of our troops from Iraq in 16 months. What steps do you expect the State Department will take to ensure that this transition occurs as safely and smoothly as possible? CLINTON: Well, Senator, thank you very much. And, you know, this is a primary priority, as you know, of the incoming administration. The president-elect, Secretary Gates, and others are working assiduously to try to be able to begin the process of withdrawal safely and responsibly as soon as possible. It is being done within the context of the Status of Forces Agreement, which has now clearly set forth the path that both the Iraqi government and the United States government intend to follow. There is some differences in timing, but the important aspect of the so-called SOFA is that the United States government under President Obama will be withdrawing troops and the Iraqi government not only accepts that, but wishes to facilitate it. So we look to begin moving our combat brigades out of cities and towns and villages hopefully by June, and then proceed with the withdrawal and, in some instances, redeployment of some of those troops to Afghanistan. Now the military details of this are, obviously, not within the province of the State Department, but there is a companion document that was signed by the United States government and the government of Iraq which was an agreement of friendship and cooperation, and in it are listed a number of areas that we intend to be very active in pursuing on rule of law, on education and health care, technical assistance for the energy industry and the like. It is -- it is my intention that we will very quickly, in consultation with the Iraqi government and other agencies within our own government, put together the teams and activities that we will be offering that will support the withdrawal of our troops and also fulfill the agreement that we have with the government of Iraq. The details are, you know, still to be worked out, as you know. Our current ambassador will be leaving after a very distinguished and courageous tour in Iraq for personal and health reasons, as I'm told, but he deserves a great deal of gratitude for the leadership he's provided on the civilian side, and we will look to move that nomination as quickly as possible, once we can make it, so that we have an ambassador on the ground and we have the assets deployed so that we are able to fulfill our part of the agreement as set forth. FEINGOLD: Thank you, Senator. Let me turn to another topic that we covered. You've been an outspoken advocate of U.S. action to stop genocide in Darfur and to protect the -- the fragile peace between the North and the South in Sudan. President-elect Obama, Vice President-elect Biden, and Dr. Susan Rice also have strong records of support for U.S. action to stop the ongoing violence in Sudan. Senator, I believe it's crucial that the new administration signal a commitment from day one to this effort. There's been a lot of talk of bold action that the United Sates can take, such as expanding sanctions, imposing a no-fly zone over Sudan, bombing aircraft, airfields and perhaps even the regime's military and intelligence assets. Can you give me your sense at this point of how viable are these options? What steps will the new administration take to demonstrate a new and bold and comprehensive approach to Sudan? CLINTON: Senator, again, this is an area of great concern to me, as it is to the president-elect. We are putting together the options that we think are available and workable. It is done in conjunction, as you would assume, with the Department of Defense. There is a great need for us to sound the alarm again about Darfur. It is a terrible humanitarian crisis compounded by a corrupt and, you know, very cruel regime in Khartoum, and it's important that the world know that we intend to address this in the most effective way possible once we have completed our review and that we intend to bring along as many people as we can to fulfill the mission of the U.N. A.U. force, which is not yet up to speed and fully deployed, as a very first measure. That's a preexisting policy we agree with. We are going to work to try to effectuate it and then, as you rightly point out, the president-elect, the vice president-elect, I and others have spoken about other options, no fly zones, other sanctions and sanctuaries, looking to deploy the U.N. A.U. force to try to protect the refugees, but also to repel the militias. So there is a lot that is under consideration and I know of your interest in this, along with other colleagues, and we will keep you advised as we move forward. FEINGOLD: Thank you very much. Obviously, you and the president-elect recognize the importance of our efforts in Afghanistan. And given the serious national security concerns in that part of the world, we have to address the growing instability there. But keeping in mind the lessons to be learned from Iraq, we need to address Afghanistan comprehensively, which I know you realize includes looking more broadly at Pakistan and India and Iran and the larger region, and we need to think clearly rather than assuming that more troops is somehow sufficient to turn the tide. Now, you and I discussed the fact that there is a significant military review underway. But will there also be a policy review to ensure we define the full scope of our mission in Afghanistan and explain to the American people how sending more American troops actually fits into a comprehensive regional strategy? CLINTON: There will certainly be such a policy review. It is the highest priority of the president-elect. He has put forth what he calls the "more for more" strategy. That's if there are to be more troops from the United States, there also needs to be more support for that mission from NATO. There needs to be more work done by the government of Afghanistan and the people. And I would add that the "more for more" strategy is not just on the military side, it's on the civilian and development side, as well. We have to look at Afghanistan and Pakistan together, particularly the border region. As you were telling me when we met, you personally have traveled along that border. You have seen with your own eyes the element of resistance and extremism that have taken root there. And it is imperative that we work with our friends in both Pakistan and Afghanistan, because this is not only about denying Al Qaida and other extremist groups safe haven, this is about persuading those two countries that their security and their future is also at risk. And I am encouraged that the democratically-elected government of Pakistan seems to be much more aware of how this is their fight, not just ours. The government of Afghanistan, as you know, the vice president-elect was just in both countries, is going to be presented with alternatives from the Obama administration that we think are not only in the interest of our overall mission, but in their interest, as well. So this will be a collaboration and the other countries you mentioned are also players, to some extent, that have to be brought in. So I anticipate, Senator, having a civilian review and a civilian presence that will be the counterpart of the military review and the military presence. FEINGOLD: Thank you, Senator. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. KERRY: Thank you, Senator Feingold. Senator Lugar? LUGAR: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Senator Clinton, when the Albanians informed the United States in the summer of 2004 that they saw some suspicious drums above Tirana and some of us went over there and found nerve gas and MANPAD missiles in sheds and what have you, and we're grateful to the Albanians seeking that assistance, this was the first opportunity for the Nunn- Lugar Act to go outside of Russia and the former states that comprised the former Soviet Union. I mention this because it created quite a problem bureaucratically. I had to get Secretary Powell's signature on a piece of paper and take another piece to the president himself to eradicate the situation. But when Senator Obama first came to the committee, we traveled to Russia and Ukraine, saw additional MANPAD missiles and, in fact, a whole acreage of weapons that were very dangerous, although not weapons of mass destruction, and we secured Senate assistance in passing the proliferation security initiative and other bills. I bring all this to your attention because despite all this legislative effort, there has been no translation of this into increased financial or leadership commitment in the State Department. Admittedly, budget constraints, problems of organization in the department, but nevertheless, all this became almost individual diplomacy rather than a concerted effort by our country. And the problem now is that we have found that there are dangerous pathogens and disease repositories in other countries in need of WMD proliferation prevention assistance. Can you describe, even in these early days of your study of this, what sort of an effort, under your leadership, the State Department may be able to offer to begin to do those things which are clearly diplomatic? That is, to open up conversations with other countries, to work with the Defense Department, of course, the Department of Energy, others who have interest in this, but which thus far the State Department has been either a reluctant or almost nonexistent partner. CLINTON: Well, Senator Lugar, I don't think there is a more important issue that confronts the incoming administration and your leadership and inspiration with respect to arms control and especially nonproliferation and the effort to contain and destroy loose nukes and other material and now moving into the pathogen area, which is particularly dangerous, is a great example to me of what we should be doing. It won't surprise you to know that in my transition review of the department, it became clear that the arms control and nonproliferation functions had been significantly degraded. There was a difference of opinion within this current administration as to whether such an effort is worthwhile, whether it pays off, whether it's just spinning wheels. I heard someone in the administration previously say, "Well, you know, we don't need this agreements because good people don't need them and bad people won't follow them." And so the infrastructure for being able to back you up when you went to Albania was severely undermined. We intend to build it even more robustly. I am seeking arms control and nonproliferation experts to come back into the department. This is one of the passionate concerns of the president-elect, who, I think, under your tutelage, understands very much the threats that we face. So I believe, Senator, that you will find a very willing and active partner in these efforts. I remember, when I met with you, looking at the pictures that you have displayed in your conference room of all of the various trips you've made, looking for this material, seeing it finally destroyed, and you know better than I how much more work lies ahead and, unfortunately, the bad guys are always at it. They're always going to be testing us. So to that end, we will have a very strong commitment to the START treaty negotiation. We want to get out of the box early. We want Russia to know that we are serious. I take to heart what the chairman said about trying to reduce our numbers even lower. This incoming president, like all presidents, has been committed to the end of nuclear weapons, as long as we can be assured that we have adequate deterrents and that we are protected going forward. So we're going to enter it with that frame of mind, which is quite a change. In the nonproliferation area, I want to do everything I can, working with you, working with former Senator Nunn, to see what authorities we need, how we can better beef them up, how we can better fund them, use this occasion even to invite some of the technical experts and others who have left the government over the last eight years to reenlist, because it is true that you could make the case that bad actors won't follow agreements. You can look at North Korea, you can look at Iran, but I think those should be the exception and not the rule. There should be a rules-based framework for arms control and nonproliferation; that if the United States once again leads and constructs that architecture, we will be in a stronger position to isolate the bad actors. So I hope, Senator, that you will take my remarks as the invitation they're meant to be for collaboration, not just consultation, as we rebuild this function, staff it, and fund it appropriately. LUGAR: This is very good news. In a visit that I had with Foreign Minister Lavrov of Russia and Mr. Kiriyenko of Rosatom in mid- December, I know they would welcome your words today, because there have certainly been some doubts on the Russian side as to where we were and the time is wasting. And so your leadership will be very much appreciated. Let me pursue a second line of questioning. At the Riga NATO summit in 2006, I gave a speech suggesting that Article 5 of NATO was violated just as severely when someone cut off natural gas and that's plunged a country either into the cold in the middle of the winter, where people would die and industry would founder, as when tanks and aircraft and what have you come across the border. Behind the scenes, the foreign minister said, "Of course, you're right, but we don't talk about this publicly. We try to deal behind the barn as best we can with an intractable situation." And now we are still in the process of coming out of another crisis of this variety. The United States has fostered the Nabucco Pipeline as a prospect of helping either our NATO partners or our EU partners, if Europeans prefer to deal with the EU in this problem. But the fact is Europeans have not dealt with it very positively. The prospects for some grid underneath Europe in which natural gas or other power might be spread has been very halting because of nationalistic boundaries, and, on occasion, you have a feeling we are more worried about the Europeans' energy problems than some of them are. I ask you this because this is a major diplomatic problem, our working with the NATO allies, with the EU, with the energy community in general, but I also come to ask if you agree that if we do not solve this problem at some point, our NATO allies are going to be rendered, if not impotent, at least in a position in which the NATO alliances weaken severely and perhaps the EU likewise, with the new members especially seeing acute pain and watching Georgia feeling a real problem in terms of their physical existence. Would you make a comment on this proposition? CLINTON: Well, Senator Lugar, I think, once again, you're demonstrating your farsighted realistic understanding of security threats, because I agree with. I think we have learned the hard way that the OPEC cartel is not just a commercial enterprise, but a security, geopolitical, strategic effort that we have had to contend with now for 36 years. As you know, Russia is attempting to create a gas equivalent of OPEC that would give it, in addition to the bilateral powers it has, a much greater multilateral international reach on gas. So this whole question of energy security, I think, has enormous implications for our country, for Europe, but, indeed, for the entire world. I'm also aware that you authored a provision in the last energy bill to have a coordinator on these energy security issues in the State Department. I intend to fulfill that. We've had individual envoys on specific pipeline issues, but we haven't brought it all together in a way that I think reflects the elevated seriousness of the challenges that are being posed. Specifically with respect to Russia and its interactions with Ukraine, Georgia, other European countries, its recent purchase of the Serbian gas utility, I hope we can make progress with our friends in NATO and the EU to understand that we do need a broader framework in which we can talk about energy security issues. It may or may not be Article 5, but I think it certainly is a significant security challenge that we ignore at our peril. So I will look, again, for advice and consultation, ideas you might have. We will be going to Europe in the due course on foreign ministers meetings, on the NATO anniversary meeting. CLINTON: This should be on the agenda and I hope that we can find willing partners to make it so. LUGAR: Thank you very much. KERRY: Thanks very much, Senator Lugar. Senator Boxer? BOXER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Clinton, I'm so excited to see you here today. As you know, I was very much in favor of your saying yes to this opportunity. You're a dedicated public servant, and I think by nominating you President-elect Obama has sent a message that world peace and stability trumps politics and ego. And I think by accepting this position, Senator Clinton, you are sending the same message, because you are working with your toughest rival, and you've set your ego aside for world peace, world stability and for the good of the country. I mean that sincerely. You know I do. I wanted to pick off a few of the issues that I care about. I'm going to do it very quickly because there are so many -- just to make my voice heard on those -- and then ask you a question on a topic you raised, and we've discussed it before, the status of women in the world -- in particular, violence against women in the world. And Nicholas Kristof has written a series of articles on this, and I've spoken with our great new chairman, and I think his concern certainly lies in this direction along with yours. So let me just say you face unbelievable challenges, you and the president-elect. Six years later, we still have 140,000 troops in Iraq. Seven years later, after the brutal attack of 9/11, we're fighting a resurgent Taliban in Afghanistan. Al Qaida poses a great threat to us on that safe haven border of the Afghan-Pakistan border. The outrageous terrorist attack in Mumbai significantly heightened tensions between India and Pakistan. And the outbreak of violence in Gaza reminds us that Israel continues to face grave threats to its very existence from never- ending rocket attacks. Our leadership is sorely needed there to protect the innocent, not just in the short term but in the long term where we hope to seek a very good solution for all sides. In Iran we face defiance, in North Korea the same. And due to our own inaction, we continue to be dependent on oil and gas whose revenues line the pockets of hostile regimes. And this dependence has slowed our fight against global warming. And I'm so proud that you mentioned global warming in your talk and that Senator Kerry, our chairman, is going to be so dedicated to helping you lead the charge in terms of a solution internationally. And as chairman of the Environment Committee, I will be by his side in that international treaty issue. HIV, AIDS, tuberculosis -- Africa, Asia, Latin America need our attention. So that's the list, and now I want to get to my questions. I have a few pictures to share with all of us. And they're brutal pictures. And I'm not showing them for shock value. I want to show them because I don't think we can look away from the plight in women in the world. And as I said, Nicholas Kristof confronts these issues in a series of compelling articles. In one, he tells us about the recent acid attack against young girls in Afghanistan, where they're going to school with their teachers. And we have a photo of one of the victims to show you on that. I'm just going to do these very quickly. OK. He profiles a story in a second picture, I'll show that, of a Pakistani woman who was viciously burned by her husband with acid because she dared to divorce him. This is what we're talking about. This is Ms. Azar. OK. Thousands of women have suffered similar attacks throughout Asia, and no prosecutions, senator. Kristof tells us the story of a Vietnamese girl named Sina Vann who was kidnapped at age 13; she was sold into sex slavery in Cambodia. When she refused to see customers, she was tortured brutally with electric shocks and locked in a coffin full of insects. And Kristof illustrates an act of horrific brutality in a piece called "If This Isn't Slavery, What Is?" in which a young Cambodian girl had her eye gouged out by her brothel owner after taking time off to recover from a forced abortion. This is a picture of that, just very beautiful, young woman. So I'm introducing some legislation. One is a companion piece of Representative Carolyn Maloney. Another one is the Afghan Women Empowerment Act, which many on this committee have worked with us on. And that's just the beginning. No woman or girl should ever have to live in fear or face persecution for being born female. And, senator, I know how deeply you feel about this. And so I wanted you to take a little more time to talk about your commitment to this particular issue. And, obviously, I would be so pleased if you would commit to help us work on a legislation to fight this immorality. CLINTON: Well, senator, you have been such a leader. And I have been honored to be your colleague and your partner in a number of these efforts that have been undertaken on behalf of women around the world. And I want to pledge to you that as secretary of state I view these issues as central to our foreign policy, not as adjunct or auxiliary or in any way lesser than all of the other issues that we have to confront. I, too, have followed the stories that are exemplified by the pictures that you held up. I mean, it is heartbreaking beyond works that, you know, young girls are attacked on their way to school by Taliban sympathizers and members who do not want young women to be educated. It's not complicated: They want to maintain an attitude that keeps women, as I said in my testimony, unhealthy, unfed, uneducated. And this is something that results all too often in violence against these young women, both within their families and from the outside. This is not culture. This is not custom. This is criminal. And it will be my hope to persuade more governments, as I have attempted to do since I spoke at Beijing on these issues, you know, 13 and some years ago, that we cannot have a free, prosperous, peaceful, progressive world if women are treated in such a discriminatory and violent way. I have also read closely Nick Kristof's articles over the last many months, but in particular the last weeks, on the young women that he has both rescued from prostitution and met who have been enslaved and abused, tortured in every way: physically, emotionally, morally. And I take very seriously the function of the State Department to lead our government through the Office on Human Trafficking to do all that we can to end this modern form of slavery. We have sex slavery, we have wage slavery, and it is primarily a slavery of girls and women. So I look also forward, senator, to reviewing your legislation and working with you as a continuing partnership on behalf of these issues we care so much about. And finally, the work that the women of the Senate did in connection with First Lady Laura Bush on behalf of the women of Afghanistan has been extremely important. That program was started in the State Department. It was midwifed by a group that I helped to start back in the Clinton administration called Vital Voices. Mrs. Bush has been outspoken on behalf of the plight of Afghan women, on behalf of Aung San Suu Kyi in Burma, and other women facing oppression around the world. And I'm very pleased that that project will be spun off to Georgetown where it will continue under Mrs. Bush's sponsorship. So we're going to have a very active women's office, a very active office on trafficking. We're going to be speaking out consistently and strongly against discrimination and oppression of women and slavery in particular, because I think that is in keeping not only with American values, as we all recognize, but American national security interests as well. BOXER: Well, I couldn't have asked for a better answer. I wanted to note, Mr. Chairman, that even the most conservative historians have said that if women in the world could be allowed to live up to their potential it would bring the whole world forward. A lot of the problems we face really come from this mindset that half of the population doesn't matter and can be abused. And they're ignored or hurt and can't contribute. So I think it's a key matter. So I'll stop there and just say how much I appreciate your comments, not only on this subject but everything you've spoken about. It shows your breadth of understanding, in the same way with my chairman, who -- I mean, I think we have a team that's just extraordinary. And I'm proud. I hope to play a small role in that team. Thank you. CLINTON: Thank you. KERRY: Senator Boxer, thank you. Thanks for that important line of inquiry. And let me just say that Senator Boxer has talked to me personally about how the committee might focus on this. And I'm determined that the committee will. We obviously have, with Lisa Murkowski and Jeanne Shaheen, who will be joining the committee, an important nucleus. But I think that all of the other members of the committee share a concern and passion about this. So we will find a way to appropriately work with the secretary and see if we can't augment our international efforts on this. Let me just say as I introduce Senator Voinovich -- speaking for the members of the committee and myself, I know -- we are saddened by your decision. We're going to work the hell out of you over the course of the next two years to get the most we can. We're delighted that you are a member of this committee, and we appreciate enormously the many contributions that you make. So prepare for -- you're not going to cruise these last few years. Senator Voinovich? VOINOVICH: You know, one of the reasons why I'm not running is that I want to devote my full time to these... KERRY: There you go. VOINOVICH: ... historic problems that we have. And how we handle them during the next two years will have a great impact on the future of our country and the world. First of all, I want to thank you for the time we spent on the telephone and also for your receiving a very lengthy letter from me. And for the record, I'd like to just give the categories: management of the State Department; visa waiver; fighting global anti-Semitism; Israel; United Nations management; Security Council, their anti-Israel bias; enforcement of 1701, which we're both familiar with; stability and security in Europe; U.S.-Serbia relationships; Kosovo; NATO expansion; Russia; Canada and U.S. relations. The thing I'd like to spend some time on is management. And I think Senator Corker did a pretty good job of outlining his concern about management of the department. But I think from a big picture point of view we have, if we can all work together on a bipartisan basis, an absolutely wonderful opportunity to really change the image of the United States of America. And we all know that our public diplomacy is at a low ebb. I think Secretary Rice has tried to do a good job in the last couple of years in terms of multilateralism. But, you know, once the water goes over the dam, it's hard to bring it back up. And I think that the Obama policy, "smart power" -- I was in Europe this last month, and they're all excited about our new president. And I think we all ought to be excited about the new national security team. Jim Jones, I had him wax about what he thinks we should do a couple years ago in Brussels at the German Marshall Fund meeting that they had. And I said, "Why can't we get this guy into this administration? He's got the right idea." And then you've got Gates, who's got the right idea. You have the idea. And so this smart power is something that we really need to focus on. I would be interested in your reaction to the recommendations of Joe Nye and Dick Armitage in terms of smart power. The other issue, of course, is when you get into the management of the department, I think you're getting Jack Lew in there and Steinberg doing the policy. And the fact that you recognize that you're going to putting out a lot of fires, and somebody's going to have to be working on this stuff from a day-to-day basis, it's important. But I think your recognition also of priorities -- prioritizing your time, where you're going to spend your time, who's going to do that -- the management here is extremely important. And I sent to you -- and I don't know whether you read it or not -- but the American Academy of Public Diplomacy has come out with a foreign affairs budget for the future. And for the record, it finds that the secretary lacks the tools, people, competencies, authorities, programs and funding to meet U.S. foreign policy demands effectively. And it talks about hiring another 4,000 people from 2010 to 2014. VOINOVICH: Again, I'd be interested either hearing from you about if you've read it or what you think about it. I haven't met personally yet with Jack Lew, but I definitely intend to do it. And I want the chairman to know that, whether I'm on this committee or not, I'm going to stay on this management thing as a ranking member of the oversight of government management and the federal workforce. And I may be on appropriations and foreign policy. It's a big deal that I think really need to get done. So what are your thoughts on that? CLINTON: Well, first, Senator, I thank you for your emphasis on workforce issues, management issues, better utilization of resource issues. That's been a hallmark of your service first in Ohio and now, of course, in the Senate. And so I welcome your involvement and your ideas as we go forward. I want to say a word about your reference to smart power because, clearly, that is what the Obama administration and I will try to do. It is a recognition that it shouldn't be an either-or debate. Either we use military force and all of the strength and power that we have or we use diplomacy and development. We want to marry those because we think that will give us a more effective foreign policy for your country. And, you know, General Jones is a perfect example. You know that he was asked by President Bush and Secretary Rice to work in the Middle East. And starting in December 2007, that's exactly what he did working with the Palestinian Authority and the Israeli Defense Force to build up security in the West Bank. And I think the results were very promising with sustained bottoms-up effort day in and day out working to bridge gaps of understanding and trust, there was a turnover of security from the Israelis to the Palestinians which is, you know, still, as of this moment, holding. And that is the work that General Jones and General Dayton and others that he was involved with have been done. And we're going to continue that kind of approach. VOINOVICH: One of the... CLINTON: So smart power is the combined tools we have. VOINOVICH: Yes. One of the things that I'm concerned about is the turf. And you've got Susan Rice going to the United Nations. She's going to become a part of the Cabinet. And I hope that there's a lot of discussion given about whose responsible for what and a recognition that there will be times where you'll all be stepping on each other's toes but that you're doing it for the best interests of the team. I think that that's very, very important. The worst thing that we can have would be that something come out and say that we've got a conflict there. I'd like to switch to another issue that I'm very interested in. And that is -- and you haven't really mentioned it. It's the issue of energy independence and its impact on our foreign policy. And as you know, for years, we were on the Environment and Public Works Committee and I talked about harmonizing the environment, our energy, our economy, and national security. And on this trip to Europe, I was frightened when I found out the influence that Russia is having in terms of natural gas, including, Great Britain. And I thought to myself this threat of being cut off is going to have an influence on their decision making. And it's extreme the important that we not be, you know, in the hands of somebody else in terms of our energy. And I'm wondering have you thought about that aspect of it? Now, climate change is very much a part of this. CLINTON: Right. VOINOVICH: But it seems to me that we ought to really raise the issue of energy independence in terms of our national security and also being able to make the right decisions in the world when some of our allies may not be able to because they're frightened that somebody's going to shut off their gas. CLINTON: Well, Senator, the president-elect and I could not agree more with your point of view. It's one of the reasons why the president-elect has talked about an energy partnership for Latin America, looking to find ways through technology and other activities we can work together to become more energy independent in this hemisphere. And, of course, we have problems in our own hemisphere with some of the providers of energy, like Hugo Chavez. So -- and, you know, President Morales. We have problems even in this hemisphere with countries feeling, you know, somewhat worried about what will happen with their energy supplies. As you and Senator Lugar have pointed out, that becomes even more acute in Europe. So I think this deserves a lot of attention. It is part of the climate change agenda, but it also deserves separate attention. And to that end, I will follow the recommendation of the legislation that Senator Lugar passed which says we should have someone coordinating energy security issues in the State Department to work with the Europeans, to work with others to try to come up with ways that we can both promote energy independence so they're not so vulnerable but also try to help equip them with ways of dealing with their current vulnerabilities, particularly to Russia. Because I see this as a big security challenge. And, you know, I know of your longstanding interest in Serbia. And, you know, with the purchase of the gas company in Serbia by Gazprom, it -- there is some concern on the part of the Serbians. Well, what's going to happen to their gas supply? Are they going to be kind of a pawn in whatever the larger Russian ambitions are about energy? So this is a very timely issue, and it should go hand in hand with our climate change work. VOINOVICH: Well, I hope that because the cost of gasoline has gone down that we're all going to just sit back like we did in 1973 and just say everything's going to be fine. Because it's not going to be fine. And I would really hope that you and your team would give a great deal of consideration to how do we become energy independent, meaning, I'd like to say, find more, use less, and then the international dimension of this that -- in terms of public diplomacy to get the other folks in the world that are emitting greenhouse gases to come together in a unique way to say we're going to do this as a team rather than us coming up with the technology and then forcing it down their throat. CLINTON: Well, I think the chairman, who's had a longstanding interest in this, knows that, as we move toward Copenhagen and attempt to craft a climate change agreement, all the major nations must be part of it. You know, China, India, Russia, and others, they have to be part of whatever agreement we put forth. And I think, as I say, this can be both included in but also independently given attention to by emphasizing energy security which I intend to do. VOINOVICH: Thank you. KERRY: Thank you very much, Senator. Senator Nelson? NELSON: Senator Clinton, I have just a couple of questions. But I want to say at the outset that this senator thinks that your husband's Clinton Global Initiative is an extremely positive thing to haven in a relationship with the future secretary of state. The fact that the Global Initiative has done such good things all over the world, the anti-viral drugs and the dispensing, the working on poverty and hunger, the fact of promoting development in the third world, I think, is a significant accomplishment and that can only lend additional credibility to your coming to the table as the foreign policy representative of the United States government. I want that on the record. Now, I want to pick up on something that Senator Boxer had said. I had the privilege of our subcommittee on this committee of chairing the hearings about rapes of American contractor women in Iraq and Afghanistan. And what we found in dramatic testimony from very courageous women that came forth and testified to the committee was that there was always an attempt among State Department contractor personnel -- and that, of course, was the jurisdictional hook through our Foreign Relations Committee. But the same applied to contractor personnel in the Department of Defense. Always, the attempt to sweep it under the rug, not have it conveyed to the U.S. attorneys for the proper prosecution. When we got this out in the open, we have tried to encourage the cooperation and collaboration between those three departments -- Justice, Defense, and State. I bring it out for your consideration. Now, let me just raise just a couple of questions. Because of the beneficence of this committee in allowing me to travel a good part of the third world of this planet, there's such poverty and disease, but we come right back to this hemisphere. And the poorest nation in this hemisphere is Haiti. Please keep your eye on Haiti. Senator Clinton, you've already been briefed on this, but one of the things that you're going to face is there is an American that is missing in Iran. Because that is a Floridian and because he has left behind a wife and seven children, I have gone to the Iranian ambassador at the United Nations who will see me even though his government will not allow him to talk to our UN ambassador. He operates under the fiction that he will see me because I'm a representative of the people of the state of Florida. But the door has been closed at every turn. What I have said to him -- and I speak through the lens of this committee hearing -- that out of human compassion this is a great opportunity for the country of Iran to crack the door because we think he is being held by the government of Iran in a secret prison in Iran. And if we want to have some renewed relations, this is a good first opportunity. Then I would just ask you -- we've basically had a lack of a vigorous policy toward Latin America. And what a great opportunity for the Obama administration. In the memory of President Kennedy's vigorous Latin American policy, the Alliance For Progress, do you have any thoughts on that? CLINTON: Well, Senator Nelson, you've covered a number of important issues. And let me start with your question about Latin America. I have a lot of thoughts about that. And I think you're right. It is a tremendous opportunity, and I look forward, on behalf of the president-elect and working with members of Congress who have a particular concern and interest in Latin America, to making it abundantly clear that the Obama administration is seeking partnerships and friendships across Latin America. We're looking forward with great anticipation to the Summit of the Americas that will be held in April. We want to, you know, not only respond to the issues that are in the headlines, as the president-elect did yesterday with President Calderon -- issues of security, issues of criminality and narco- trafficking and the like. But we want to seize the opportunities in Latin America, which is why the energy partnership that the president- elect has suggested that's so much potential. The countries of Latin America are really our closest allies. If you look at trade, if you look at familial relationships, you can see all of these connections. And I think that we're going to put a new face on American diplomacy as we reach out to Latin America. That is particularly a mission of mine, and I share your concern about Haiti. It is, as you say, one of the poorest nations in the world -- the poorest in our hemisphere. I hope that we can have a comprehensive approach that could alleviate the suffering the people of Haiti. And I look forward to working with you on that. CLINTON: With respect to the Floridian who is in prison, it would be an extraordinary opportunity for the government of Iran to make such a gesture to permit contact, to release him, to make it clear that there is a new attitude in Iran, as we believe there will be with the Obama administration toward engagement, carefully constructed, and with very clear outcomes attempted. NELSON: His name is Bob Levinson. CLINTON: That's right. And, you know, Senator, on contractors, this is going to be a big issue for this committee. We have seen the abuses by contractors, but even when there are not headline-grabbing abuses, there has been a steady transfer of authority and resources from government employees and a chain of accountability to contractors, and we have reaped the very difficult consequences of that. We -- we know, obviously, of the security contractors and some of the difficulties that they have presented, but it's been contractors across the board. We have used so many of them, particularly in Iraq, but not exclusively, and I think we have to take a hard look at whether we want the U.S. government to turn into a contracting agency or whether we're going to be smart about using our resources because, in most instances, contracting out a job costs more than keeping it in-house and building up expertise and experience and imposing accountability. So I look forward to working with you and your subcommittee to try to determine what we can do about contractors. But I would just end on this cautionary note. The chairman asked me about the role of the State Department in Iraq. We're going to try to fulfill any of the pledges we've made in the agreement of friendship and cooperation. Our civilian employees need to be protected. As we withdraw our troops, we have to be absolutely assured that they will be protected by the Iraqis, or we have to use contracts, or we have to wonder whether we can send them out to the countryside if there is still the threat of violence. So this has a direct effect on how we're going to perform our diplomatic responsibilities inside Iraq and other countries. KERRY: Thank you, Senator Nelson. Senator Murkowski? MURKOWSKI: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And welcome to you, Senator Clinton. Thank you for your leadership, for your willingness to -- to step forward and assume this very, very important position for our country, for the nation. I truly appreciate all that you are poised to do and what you have done in the past. We had an opportunity in my office last week to -- to discuss an issue that is, I think, vitally important to this country, and that is our role as an Arctic nation, and I know oftentimes my colleagues don't view the United States as an Arctic nation, but we are by virtue of Alaska, and we have opportunities, when it comes to a leadership role, in collaboration on research, on environmental issues, on issues as they relate to commerce, and we're seeing more of those issues present themselves as we see a world out there that is more and more free of sea ice. The loss of summer sea ice from climate change is having a truly dramatic effect on the Arctic, and the Bush administration saw this unfolding. We've been working with them for -- for about the past 18 months to advance a new Arctic policy. Our Arctic policy is about 15 years stale. That was just released on Friday. I don't know if you've had an opportunity to fully review it. But I'd like your comments here this morning on the evolving role of the Arctic, on the role that we can play as an Arctic nation in dealing with our neighbors. We discussed the issue of Russia, and at some -- oftentimes, we've got some very difficult relationships with their -- them, but the opportunity that -- on -- on issues as they relate to research and an evolving world up north, how that might play out, and if you could just speak to that issue this morning. I -- I have missed most of your comments this morning, and I apologize for that. I've been in two other confirmation hearings, but I'm pretty certain that you haven't fielded yet a question on the Arctic. CLINTON: And, Senator, it's very timely that one has been raised because, as I -- as I had said to you before and -- and even when you and your husband hosted Senator McCain's CODEL when we were in Alaska and saw for ourselves some of the changes that are going on in the Arctic, both on land and in the sea, you have been a leader on this issue, and I hope your time has come, Senator, because I believe that the issues of the Arctic are one of those long-term matters that will dramatically effect our commercial, our environmental, our energy futures that we have got to start attending to now. So, to that end, I agree with you completely that the issues that are posed by the recent Bush administration report that did come out just a few days ago, the work of the Arctic Council that has been an attempt to try to summon the best thinking of the government and outside experts will find a very receptive ear in the State Department. I think President-elect Obama and I see that this is one of those areas that offers a chance for cooperation that might lead not only to positive actions with respect to the Arctic, but deepen our partnerships with Russia and others across the board. So, to that end, we will be working to try to sort through the recommendations and the ideas in the recent reports to see how we fit that in to already existing frameworks and consider what additional actions and positions might be necessary, but I agree with you completely. You know, maybe because the change has been relatively rapid with the melting of the sea ice, people haven't kept up with what is going on in the Arctic, and I -- when I was in your office and you were telling me about how cruise ships now are going to Point Barrow, I was shocked. MURKOWSKI: So were the people at Point Barrow. So were the people at Point Barrow! I mean, look on the map. It's the northernmost place in the United States, and it's not a place that one would have thought previously was on the tour for cruise ships. CLINTON: We know that there's going to be a necessity to map out our continental shelf. We know that there will be disputes over energy resources and minerals and other natural resources in the Arctic. To go along with that, I -- I know that hand in hand with concerns about the Arctic is, you know, the Oceans Convention, the Law of the Sea, which would clarify a lot of the problems that you're going to face in Alaska if we don't have a national Arctic policy that also includes what our international position is on the oceans, and I think... MURKOWSKI: Will ratification of the Law of the Sea Treaty be a priority for you? CLINTON: Yes, it will be, and it will be because it is long overdue, Senator. The Law of the Sea Treaty is supported by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, environmental, energy, and business interests. I have spoken with some of our -- our naval leaders, and they consider themselves to be somewhat disadvantaged by our not having become a party to the Law of the Sea. Our industrial interests, particularly with seabed mining, just shut up. I mean, there's nothing that they can do because there's no protocol that they can feel comfortable that gives them the opportunity to pursue commercial interests. So, for all of those reasons -- and I mention it in conjunction with the Arctic because I think they go hand in hand -- we've got to figure out where our boundaries are. You know, if people start drilling in areas that are now ice free most of the year, and we don't know where they can and can't drill or whether we can, we're going to be disadvantaged. So I think that you will have a very receptive audience in our State Department and in our administration. MURKOWSKI: Well, I'm -- I'm very pleased, very encouraged to hear that and truly look forward to the opportunity to be working with you to advance these -- these very important issues, and -- and as we look to some of the basics that we're lacking up in the Arctic, whether it's the -- the capacity for search or rescue, you know, what -- what -- what we need to be prepared for in this -- in this ever- evolving world without borders, it's quite a concept to think. One -- one more question, another that Alaskans look to with great interest because of our proximity to North Korea: As we look to the hot spots in the world, we certainly appreciate all of the other threats that you will be dealing with as secretary of state, but you kind of get most nervous about those that are more proximate to you, and North Korea is certainly to us. In that vein, what do you see the future of the six-party talks under -- under your tenure -- how do you anticipate that you'll be able to -- whether it's jumpstart the process or -- how do you see that moving forward? CLINTON: Senator, I've had several lengthy conversations with Secretary Rice who has brought me up to date on the status of the six- party talks. It is a framework that the president-elect and I believe has merit, but it also provides an opportunity, as Secretary Rice has testified before this committee, for bilateral contacts as well between North Korea and the United States. Again, this is under review. We're looking at all of the record of the negotiation up to this date. Our goal is to end the North Korean nuclear program, both the plutonium reprocessing program and the highly enriched uranium program which there is reason to believe exists, although never quite verified, and it is our strong belief that the six-party talks, particularly the role that China is currently playing, along with our close allies South Korea and Japan, is a vehicle for us to exert pressure on North Korea in a way that is more likely to alter their behavior. Again, I have no illusions about that. I think it takes tough reality-based diplomacy to determine what is doable. We have got to end North Korea as a proliferator. There is certainly reason to believe that North Korea has been involved with Syrian efforts. We know that it was involved with Libyan efforts. So it's not only preventing the threat from North Korea, which is of particular interest to Hawaii, Alaska, and the West Coast of the United States, but it is their role as a proliferator. So we will -- we will embark upon a very aggressive effort to try to determine the best way forward to achieve our objectives with them. MURKOWSKI: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you for your, again, willingness and -- and your great capacity (inaudible) effort. Appreciate it. KERRY: Thank you, Senator Murkowski. Let me just say to you and to others interested that we are already -- I have talked to Senator Lugar about this, and I've talked to Senator Clinton about it. We will be -- we are now laying the groundwork for and expect to try to take up the Law of the Sea Treaty. So that will be one of the priorities of -- of the committee, and the key here is just timing, how we proceed. Senator Cardin? CARDIN: Well, first, Senator Kerry, let me -- let me tell you how proud all of us are to serve on this committee, particularly with you as our chairman. We're -- we're looking forward to this time and know the challenges are great, and we thank you for stepping forward as chairman of the committee. KERRY: Pleasure. CARDIN: And to Senator Clinton, thank you. Thank you for being willing to do this, your entire family. I -- I know it was a difficult decision. I know how much you love being a senator from New York, and we just thank you for stepping forward. The issues are so difficult in this country, and it couldn't be a better person to represent our nation, and we thank you for doing that. We had a chance to talk about several issues when you were in my office over the weekend, and your opening statement and your responses to questions have covered much of the area. Particularly I want to just underscore the challenge you're going to have in the Middle East between the Israelis and the Palestinians, and I think you have covered that in your statement and in your response. I want to deal first with another void that you've created in the United States Senate because of your selection as secretary of state. Now, obviously, it's going to be a void for the people of New York as you leave that Senate seat, but also the Helsinki Commission which you serve as an active member and you've been a very valuable member of the commission. I will have the honor of chairing the commission during these next two years. And, as you know, it was established as the U.S. arm to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, created in 1975 with President Ford, as a way to engage Europe on security issues, on economic issues, and on human rights. It's perhaps best known for its work in the former Soviet Union when it spoke up to the human rights violations and led to changes within the Soviet Union. In recent years, it's been very helpful on creating a strategy in Europe to deal with anti-Semitism and other forms of discrimination. CARDIN: It has been actively involved on the human trafficking issues, and we've had discussions here today about necessities to monitor not only the activities from those countries that -- where the women -- and they're usually women and children -- come from, but also the receiving countries and to deal with the problems. And we now have a reporting issue within the State Department to see how well countries are doing on trafficking and a lot of that work came out of the Helsinki Commission. And the list goes on and on and on. My point or request to you is that I that the OSCE and the U.S. involvement through the Helsinki Commission can be a valuable tool in your game plan on dealing with the policy objectives of the United States, whether it's engaging Russia, and Russia, as you know, is an active member of OSCE, or whether it's dealing with global climate change or whether it's dealing with refugee issues. And I would just urge you to challenge us as to how the OSCE can be more effective in dealing with your game plan for foreign policy of this country. CLINTON: Well, Senator Cardin, it's been an honor to serve on the Helsinki Commission and I know you have not only a longstanding interest, but involvement, going back to your days in the House, with respect to OSCE and the Helsinki accords. And when you and I were talking, we briefly discussed how history sometimes plays out, because at the time of the Helsinki accords, then President Ford was urged by both the right and the left not to go and negotiate those, that they would not be a good idea, and he very courageously said that he was going to go forward, because any opportunity to negotiate, to try to set up a framework for human rights was in America's interest. And we now can look back and see how President Ford's vision which led to the Helsinki accords, which, obviously, the former Soviet Union was a party to, actually contributed to the eventual breakup of the Soviet Union, because it gave legitimacy and voice to people who were dissidents and had human rights complaints. So I think this work must continue. I look forward to figuring out ways that we can work together. And I also would appreciate any advice you would have about how the framework of OSCE and the Helsinki accords could be perhaps modernized and transported into the 21st century, with some of the problems that we see around the world today, because the problems are certainly different, but human nature isn't, and how we take advantage of diplomacy and agreement and setting goals on human rights will be a priority and doing that in service of outcomes, like what we saw with the Helsinki accords is what I'm interested in. CARDIN: And that's one of the highest priorities for us to evaluate how we can modernize the Helsinki Commission and the OSCE process. And we are fortunate to have representatives from the executive branch that serve on the commission with us. So we will do this in conjunction with your own views as to how you think we can best serve the objectives of this country. Let me mention one or two issues that are relevant to the human rights issues, but also relevant to the broader issues. The refugee problem, particularly as it relates to Iraq, I mean, we hear a lot about how we're going to ultimately resolve the circumstances in Iraq. When you have five million displaced individuals, many of which are in other countries, it makes it extremely challenging to see a lasting solution in that region. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter. You must select a newsletter to subscribe to. Several Senators have sent a letter to President-elect Obama urging a White House office on refugee issues just so we can get the type of visibility we think on refugees. Clearly, this is a high area of concern within the foreign policy in the State Department. I would welcome your involvement as to how we come to grips with the refugee crisis in that region. CLINTON: Well, Senator, as you know, there is an office in the State Department -- population, migration and refugees. It's our intention to staff that with effective and creative professionals, because we agree that the refugee problem is growing worse in many places around the world. You reference Iraq. One of the challenges of the Iraqi government and, insofar as we are involved, our government, in sort of balancing how we're going to support the stability of the Iraqi government and help them deal with the repatriation and return, both externally and internally, of Iraqis is a big challenge to the Iraqi government that we're conscious of. But we have refugee populations, some of decades longstanding and some of a few days standing, in so many places. I will do my very best to elevate this issue, to give you the kind of expertise within the State Department that will give you comfort that we're going to make this a high priority, and to come up with solutions to some of our longstanding refugee challenges. This is a very complex issue, because everywhere we look in the world, conflict, famine, disease, the economy, we have refugees. And so our hope is that we can get a more comprehensive strategy to deal with refugees, come to the Congress to get the funding for refugees, a problem which is compounded by the point that Senator Lugar made at the beginning of the hearing about the food crisis. So I would welcome working with you and those who are concerned, as you are, to come up with an effective strategy for the United States to deploy with respect to refugees. CARDIN: Well, thank you very much for that answer. Many of us have been asking you questions on energy. Energy is a huge issue internationally and the State Department is going to have to play a critical role. We've talked about the global climate change issues. We've talked about some of the conduct of other countries trying to stop energy from flowing between different countries. I want to talk about one other issue. We have a lot of mineral rich countries in which its citizens are very poor. We think that many of those revenues are going against U.S. security interests, funding activities that are against our country. There is an effort made for transparency and extraction, so that we set up the model system for how a nation should handle how its mineral wealth is used for the benefit of the people of their own country. The United States is participating in that discussion. I think we could be more aggressive in trying to move forward. We've talked about foreign assistance and many of these countries that have mineral wealth are receiving foreign aid from the United States and we don't know where their mineral wealth is going. So I just want to bring that to your attention and I think this is an area that we can make much further advancements in trying to help deal with the poverty around the world. CLINTON: Very creative suggestion, Senator, and we should look at the models of countries that have handled their mineral wealth to the advantage of their people. Botswana comes to mind. They've been very good stewards of their diamonds and have invested in roads and schools and infrastructure in Botswana. So we should be looking for best practices and see if there is a way to create a regulatory framework that would give both protection and incentives to mineral rich countries so that they would be able to stand up for their rights and then use the revenues in a very positive way to enhance the well being of their people. CARDIN: Thank you very much, look forward to working with you. CLINTON: Thank you. KERRY: Thanks a lot, Senator Cardin. Let me just say that given the time here, we're going to have two more rounds, do two more questioners, before we do the mandatory break at quarter of. And just for the knowledge of the press and others, and many of them are already aware of this, we have a very extensive questioning process that takes place prior even to our convening here, called "questions for the record." And the committee has already submitted, just through the chair, over 138 questions and there were additional questions by other Senators, all of which have been answered by Senator Clinton, and we're very appreciative for the in-depth answers. We know it's an enormous task and a lot of people have ground away on it, but we're very, very appreciative. What it does do is facilitate the hearings considerably and help us to sort of narrow the areas of inquiry that we need to do here now. With that said, let me turn now to Senator DeMint. DEMINT: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Senator Lugar. And, Mr. Chairman, I would like to submit for the record a longer list of questions that I will not have time to ask today. KERRY: Fine, but we are going to try to proceed forward. So we'll try to get those answered in the next 24 hours for you, Senator. DEMINT: Thank you very much. KERRY: Because we do have a business meeting scheduled for Thursday. DEMINT: Thank you. Senator Clinton, congratulations on your nomination. I appreciate your call. It's amazing what a little communication can do. So I feel a lot better about you already. I am optimistic and hopeful about your role as secretary of state and despite the news accounts that say that I'm the one that's going to ask you the hard questions about potential conflicts of interest, I have no questions about your integrity. I would support Senator Corker and others who support your nomination in appealing to you to do whatever is necessary to silence any critics before you take office. Enough said, as far as I'm concerned. The State Department, over several administrations, has a mixed reputation, at best. In private, talking to military leaders, business people, international adoption agencies, independent aid workers, even foreign officials, I often hear the State Department is more of an obstacle than a help or mixed reviews, again, at best. We even have foreign governments calling our office and coming in to meet with us to want to bypass the State Department to develop better relations with our country, and I'm sure other members have experienced the same thing. So the challenge is tremendous. You mentioned in your opening statement the many challenges all around the world, economic, human rights, and there is so much to do that it's mind-boggling. And with our economy and our debt and the domestic needs that we have and incredible levels of spending that we're experiencing now, it's very difficult to see an expanded role for America around the world, certainly one that has to be prioritized. And I would join with Senator Isakson and I'll paraphrase, but we need to be that city on the hill. I'm not sure that we can afford to build cities on the hill all around the country, although I hope we can play a role. With so much to do, I just wanted to ask you to comment about other ways that we might can accomplish our goals. I've seen, as I've traveled and talked to people from around the world, that very often, business, trade, commerce is our best ambassador and even in difficult political times, when Germany and France are squabbling with the U.S., I have a Michelin headquarters and BMW headquarters in my district, business goes on and everybody gets along just fine despite the political wrangling. And we also see private charities, aid workers, missionaries doing so much good. How do you see the role of the State Department in facilitating the good private sector things that are there without trying to replace them and maybe without trying to manage them? CLINTON: Well, Senator, I appreciate very much your posing this question, because I think it's a real opportunity for us if we can figure out how best to better coordinate and facilitate the private sector and the not-for-profit and religious community of the United States on behalf of humanitarian and commercial efforts. I think that the State Department has been reviewed in a mixed way for a number of years. In part, it's because the work of the State Department, both in diplomacy and development, is not as well understood and sometimes appears to be frustrating. I mean, trying to argue over where a comma goes or what the appropriate language would be and how to actually get to that treaty, it does raise, in the eyes of the American people, questions about, well, what is it we do. And I think we have a bigger job, which I will assume, of trying to explain to the American people why our national security depends on defense, diplomacy and development. Now, defense is primarily a government mission, as we know, and thank goodness for these young men and women and their commanders who wear the uniform of our country. Diplomacy is primarily a government mission, but there are lots of ways that nongovernment actors, like corporations, like religious organizations, like charities and foundations, are actually building relationships with foreign governments and foreign people all the time, which, if done in the right way, are really value added to who we are as a nation and what we can achieve. Right now, in Rwanda, a number of foundations, a number of churches, a number of private sectors actors are all working to try to build that country back up. So I would hope that when we look at the State Department, we think of the role of foreign policy, diplomacy and development as involving not just those who are the foreign service officers and the civil service professionals and the development experts, but really it's all hands on deck. CLINTON: We have a lot of work to, in my view, kind of repair damage and get out there and -- and present America as we know we are. But I don't think in this complex and dangerous world there is any substitute for the role of the State Department and USAID professionals. So it will be my undertaking to make this department as efficient as possible, so that you know you're getting your money's worth; to streamline it as much as possible. I mean, I will be frustrated, as you will be, if all we do is pile up paper. I want strategies. I want specific ideas. I want more partnerships. That's how I see the role of the State Department in the 21st century. That's how I hope that USAID will, you know, be revitalized to perform that role as well. But the disparity of resources is such that when you've got more than 10 times the resources going to the Defense Department than you have going to the State Department and foreign aid, the Defense Department has been, in effect, recreating mini-State Departments. You know, they're out doing development assistance and rule of law and other things. Why? Because, as I said earlier, they have a presumption of being able to move much more quickly. The money we give them is, in many respects, more flexible. So I think we have to see how do we get what we want and what we're paying for out of our State Department and USAID. And I want to work closely with you and others on this committee. I want new ideas. I want best practices. But I don't think there's any substitute for having seasoned, experienced professionals and experts sort of leading our efforts on diplomacy and development, and working, where possible, in partnership and coordination with the private sector and the not-for-profit sector. DEMINT: Thank you. I can see I'm not going to get to too many of my questions, but I'm -- I'll -- just a couple of concerns and one last question. Just as you're concerned about the disadvantage, difficulty, of women and children around the world, much the same can be said for religious persecution. Even in countries like Iraq that we're doing so much to -- so much sacrifice to free, Iraqi Christians can't come home. I would hope you would be sensitive to that. And also, we have spoken about Israel, and I think there's widespread agreement of our support there, but it appears to be naive and illogical to continue to -- diplomacy and calls for peace with governments that are publicly opposed to the existence of Israel. How we reconcile that is -- is very difficult. One last concern, I think, and one difficulty that you will have is balancing protecting our sovereignty as a nation with international cooperation. I've seen with some of our agreements with the United Nations, the United States is going to bear the brunt of the expense and often the execution of -- of -- of what is -- the U.N. promises. They don't back up their own resolutions, as in Iraq or now in Iran, North Korea. We submit and we -- and we complied and yield in many ways our decision-making to organizations like the United Nations, but then we're left holding the bag with what they don't do. And maybe in just a minute or so that I have left -- how can we do a better job of being cooperative, at the same time protecting our sovereignty? CLINTON: Well, I think the absolute bottom line for any agreement or undertaking by the United States government is that it has to be, in our view, in the best interest of the United States... DEMINT: Right. CLINTON: ... that it furthers our national security, advances our interests, and both protects and reflects our values. That's how I see my responsibility. I think there are ways that we can cooperate more than we have without in any way impinging upon our sovereignty, our identity or our security interests or values. But I will remain very conscious of that, Senator, because two issues that you -- you mentioned -- religious persecution -- that's a -- you know, that -- that is anathema to Americans. I mean, we believe in the freedom to worship. And there is a -- an office in the State Department that is committed to religious freedom. But I -- I believe that that is an area that we want to talk more about, that we want to raise, because of the significance. You point out rightly that, you know, we've given a lot of aid and we've -- we've given a lot of blood on behalf of certain countries that -- that persecute not just Christians but people of other religious beliefs, even interfaith beliefs within the same denomination or particular view of religion. I think on Israel, you cannot negotiate with Hamas until it renounces violence, recognizes Israel and agrees to abide by past agreements. That is just, for me, a -- you know, an absolute. You know, that is the United States government's position. That is the president-elect's position. And finally, on the questions, we will turn those around in the next 24 hours, Senator. I know that the chairman and Senator Lugar submitted very thoughtful, extensive questions, and we responded to those, more than 300 of them. We will take whatever other questions for the record any member has and turn those around within 24 hours, because I -- I want you to have as -- as comprehensive a record as possible for you to consider my nomination. DEMINT: Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. KERRY: Let me just shock your troops by telling you that, unfortunately, we have to, in order to move forward, close the record by 12 noon tomorrow, so... CLINTON: OK. KERRY: We'll get the Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) out tonight. (LAUGHTER) Look at those smiles over there. CLINTON: Don't look too closely, because they haven't had a lot of sleep. They're not... KERRY: I'm confident... CLINTON: ... not looking too alert today. KERRY: Anyway. What we're going to do is Senator Menendez will close out the morning questioning, and then we'll come back. Senator Isakson, you'll lead off as close to 2 o'clock as possible. It's slightly dependent on someone else's schedule, but we'll -- we'll figure that out. We'll go through the rest of the questioning, and then we'll have another round. We'll probably shorten the second round. But I think -- Senator Clinton and I have discussed this -- we are both prepared to stay here as late as necessary to try to get through it. There are other areas of inquiry that I know a lot of us have, and there are some important subjects that we haven't yet touched on, so we need to expedite that if we can. Senator Menendez? MENENDEZ: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to start off by saying, Senator Clinton, I -- I appreciate the significant voluntary steps that go above and beyond the requirements of the law and ethics regulations that you have been willing to put forth. I think that they are exemplary and should answer a lot of people's concerns. And as I said, they're above and beyond the law and the ethics requirements, and I appreciate that. Particularly, I appreciate that even pledges and proposed contributions to the Clinton Foundation will be eligible for review by the deputy legal adviser and designated agency ethics official at the State Department. That, again, is above and beyond. And I think that that's the type of tone and tenor to set, and I want to salute you for -- for doing that. You and I have had the conversation to talk about something I care about a great deal, which is foreign assistance. We've held -- been privileged in the last Congress to chair the Subcommittee on Foreign Assistance, and we've held a series of hearings on it. You know, it's interesting to note that nearly a half a century ago, President Kennedy sent a letter to the Congress in which he said something that if we were to hear today would largely be the same. He said the economic collapse of those free but less-developed nations which now stand poised between sustained growth and economic chaos would be disastrous to our national security, harmful to our comparative prosperity, and offensive to our conscience. He said no objective supporter of foreign aid can be satisfied with the existing program. Actually, a multiplicity of programs -- bureaucratically fragmented, awkward, slow. Administration is diffused over a haphazard and irrational structure covering at least four departments and several other agencies. And he went to talk about the morale of those employees trying to pursue that. That was nearly a half a century ago, and in some respects I could say that that is a large degree of what we face today. So as one of the most powerful tools of soft diplomacy, I'd like to hear -- you know, some of us are concerned. I -- I've heard about the designation of Mr. Lew as the deputy secretary of state for resources and management -- that he will be the advocate. You know, that's a broad title, lot of resources, lot of management. Question is, you know, how do we ensure that we elevate foreign assistance? How do we ensure that we appoint a high-profile manager to lead that agency, a strong, independent voice for foreign assistance, building up the staff at AID, making sure that a lot of what's gone to the Defense Department by -- by -- simply by -- the lack of having an appropriate structure and effort at State comes back to State, where it really should be done, in cooperation with the Defense Department. Give us -- give me a -- a sense of confidence that under your leadership this is something that we're going to see pursued vigorously. CLINTON: Well, you have, you know, my commitment that it will be pursued vigorously. It is an area that I care deeply about. It is where much of my, you know, early public voluntary efforts were directed. And I am hopeful, Senator, that we're going to put in place a system that will, number one, rationalize what we have there now, and not only within the State Department and USAID, but as you know, there are pockets of foreign aid programs across the government that are technically under the coordination of the secretary, but are not really working together as they should. And -- and when we look at USAID, we've got to get a handle on the contracting out of functions and personnel. It leaves us without the capacity to respond to the many needs that we know are there. When we look at what's called the G function in the State Department, that's where you see population, migration and refugees and, you know, having served very happily in this body, I know how -- how it seems that if an issue of such importance as refugees is not getting attention, then let's put a coordinator in the White House, and maybe that'll get people's attention. But of course, what we ought to be doing is making the existing State Department programs work effectively. We have PEPFAR, which has been very successful and is a great tribute to the Bush administration. But it is within the State Department but not within USAID, but it utilizes many of the development and health experts in USAID both on the government payroll and on contracts to actually do the work. We have the Millennium Challenge Corporation, which is a very creative and innovative approach to foreign aid, which is an independent entity, which again looks to USAID for advice and expertise. So we've got to get our arms around what you could think of as traditional foreign aid -- health, education, economic empowerment and the like -- plus what is now becoming increasingly important -- that's the reconstruction, stability, conflict resolution, peacekeeping challenge that we face. And, Senator, I am determined that we're going to present to you a plan and a system that will try to maximize coordination, minimize redundancy and make the case for the increased resources that are so desperately needed if we intend to meet the missions that we've been given. And that is why I think Jack Lew, who will fill the deputy position on budget and resources, is the point of accountability, because so much of what we're going to have to straighten out and fix are resource decisions. And we've got to make the case -- I think Secretary Gates is open to the case. I know the president-elect is very committed. He wants a -- actually an increase in foreign aid because he believes so strongly in its efficacy as part of our foreign policy. They're committed to transferring assets and functions back to the State Department, but we have to prove that we're ready to take them on, that we're going to handle them, that we can instill confidence in you and Senator Cardin and others about these core functions and, you know, answer Senator DeMint's concerns about, you know, are we really doing what we need to do here. So that is my pledge to you, and I'm going to work as hard as I know how to make it happen. MENENDEZ: We'd look forward to working with you on that. Let me just touch on specific areas, and then I hope not to give you any questions at the end of the day so you can move through the process -- written questions. But in 100 days, the new administration will inherit the Summit of the Americas, and it will be either the president-elect's imprint or it will be that which existed before. We have challenge in Latin America, and our challenges are lack of engagement in a way that makes a difference. We need to care less about what Chavez says and more about what we do at the end of the day. And so I hope that we can work with you and that the administration will focus very quickly on what that summit is going to look like. And I hope that we have an Americas Initiative soon -- obviously, not by the summit, but at least talking about the outlines of what that will be. The hemisphere is incredibly important. It is in turmoil and challenge in many parts of it. And I hope that that is something that we will look at very quickly. MENENDEZ: I know you have supported the legislation we had that came to the committee in a bipartisan, unanimous on creating a social and economic development fund for the Americas. We'll call it to your attention. Two last areas of the world. There are many, but I hope that the support that you gave while you were a senator to the question of the Armenian genocide that the president-elect has, himself, supported, the recognition of that. You know, if we are to say never again, part of that is ultimately the recognition of what has happened so that we can move forward. And I hope that you will be an advocate of having us get off of where we have been and move forward to a recognition of that part of history that is universally recognized so that we can move forward in that respect. And I also hope, in a part of the world that's very important to me, on the question of the reunification of Cypress, that we have honest brokers at the State Department at the end of the day. One that recognizes that if Greek and Turkish Cypriotes could work for each other, they would seek a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation that could move forward and reunify the island and end up the incredible militarization of the island -- the most militarized part of the world per capita. So I hope that you will look at those issues. I know the positions you've taken as a senator, and I applaud them. I hope that they won't change drastically as you move to the secretary of state. CLINTON: Senator, we will be looking very closely at those and other challenging issues with the eye of moving forward and being effective in responding to these very legitimate concerns. MENENDEZ: I look forward to supporting your administration. KERRY: Thank you, Senator Menendez. Thank you, Senator Clinton for a good morning of testimony. You've displayed one of the assets necessary for the job. You sat there for three hours and 15 minutes. And we look forward to the afternoon session. And I should say that to everybody here. It's been a remarkably attentive and quiet audience. So we appreciate that very much. KERRY: So we will recess until no sooner than 2 o'clock, and we'll try it make it as absolutely close to 2 as possible. We stand in recess. Thank you. (RECESS) KERRY: The hearing will come back into order, and I apologize to everybody, particularly to our colleagues who were here on time. Senator Isakson, I'm sorry about that. We had the president-elect meeting with us at our caucus on the minor topic of the monster of TARP and also the stimulus. So I'm sure you can all understand it was spirited and important and that's why we are late. And I apologize for that. I said that we would pick up -- we're going to complete the first round of ten-minute questions. And I think for the second round, we'll probably going with seven minutes and see how we proceed. But, Senator Isakson, you're up next, and we appreciate your patience. ISAKSON: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And, Chelsea -- Chelsea, you should know that your mother and I had a conversation in my office. She's very proud of you and very proud of the support you give to her. And I got to show her all my grandchildren, so she'll have plans for you in the future, I can guarantee you. (LAUGHTER) Senator Clinton, it's a pleasure. I want to commend you -- this is not really a question; just a statement. But I have the highest regard for Senator Lugar. I think the remarks -- the pre-hearing questions he sent to you with regard to the Clinton Foundation were very important, and I think his insights are very important because, in your answers to those questions, on a couple of occasions, you made the statement the goal was to protect against even the appearance of a conflict of interest between his work, meaning the foundation's, and the duties of secretary of state. And we all know that in this world of politics, perception becomes reality. So appearance is everything. And I commend Senator Lugar's recommendations to you. Also, twice in your opening remarks which were extensive and, really, appreciated because you really covered some very important topics, you referred to what I call the three D's -- diplomacy, development, and defense -- on two different occasions. Once, vis-a- vis Al Qaida and then other just based on overall policy. I believe that the better your diplomacy, the better your ability to defend yourself. And a strong military is a great foundation for good diplomacy. And then if you add the development -- which I think is soft power or smart power -- you have a great trilogy. Do you agree with that? CLINTON: Senator Isakson, I couldn't say it any better. I certainly do agree. In order to protect and defend the United States of America, to advance our interests, and to further our values, we have to have all three of those elements of our power working in concert. But, clearly, as I said, as you pointed out in my opening statement, a strong military is essential for the ultimate protection of our country and our interests. It is my hope that through more vigorous and effective diplomacy we would be able to resolve both problems that we have with individual countries and the transnational problems like proliferation that threaten out of us. And so I think that the State Department has a very big responsibility to improve its capacity with respect to both diplomacy and development because, without those two elements of our power projection and our policy being as effective as they can be, we're not going to have the agile, comprehensive foreign policy we should look forward to. ISAKSON: In the presidential debate, I watched both sides -- ours and yours. There was a significant debate over foreign policy and over the issue of precondition. I was -- really appreciated your responses throughout, and I think you added a great deal of strength to that debate. And now that we're looking at suggestions of talking to Hamas or maybe Hezbollah or maybe Iran, preconditions are absolutely essential, I think, to good, strong diplomacy. I hope you still feel that way. CLINTON: Well, I certainly do, as does the president-elect. I think that his commitment to vigorous and effective diplomacy is in context of his understanding that there are different ways for us to engage. When it comes to non-state actors like Hamas, as I said at the very end of the morning session, there are conditions. Hamas must renounce violence. They must recognize Israel, and they must agree to abide by all previous agreements. There are conditions that are usually part of the preliminary discussion that would lead to any kind of negotiation. The president- elect believes that he has the right to claim the opportunity to speak with anybody at any time if it's in furtherance of our country's national interests and security. But he fully appreciates the preliminary work that has to be done in order to tee up any such discussions. So I think we're in vigorous agreement, Senator, that we want to be smart about how we engage in diplomacy. We want to make sure that when the president of the United States or the secretary of state is engaged in any diplomatic effort that all of the necessary preliminary work, including conditions, if appropriate, have been met before doing so. ISAKSON: You quoted George Marshal at the end of your remarks in saying that sometimes our enemies are not the nations or doctrines but they are, in fact, hunger, poverty, desperation and chaos. I'm ranking member on the Africa Subcommittee. And if you talk about desperation, chaos, hunger, and poverty, certainly, you can talk about the continent of Africa and, in particular, North Africa and the Horn of Africa where Al Qaida is attempting to do what it did in Afghanistan, effectively, a decade and a half ago. And you talked about smart power. I think AFRICOM was a smart move on behalf of our country. And although a lot of people don't realize what AFRICOM is doing, they are military personnel doing a lot of soft power. They're drilling wells. They're building bridges. They're doing the things -- I hate to say this -- but Hamas and Hezbollah figured it out. They got political strength by giving people housing and clothing. A lot of times that use of soft power can win over people's attitudes towards you. So I hope, as the couple of years go by, or the next four years go by, we can work together on the continent of Africa and on those issues because I think it's the next place we are vulnerable if we aren't proactive in dealing with the governments, the people, the poverty, and, obviously, also, continuing the Bush PEPFAR program which has been so successful -- that and the malaria eradication. CLINTON: Well, Senator, I appreciate it when I spoke with you, your commitment to Africa and your making it a priority of the service you've performed here on the committee. And I look forward to working with you. It is a serious concern that we could see safe havens created again. The chaos that flows from failed states like Somalia, at this moment, the aftermath of autocratic regimes that have so mistreated their people, like Zimbabwe; the anarchy and terrible violence in Eastern Congo. I mean, those are breeding grounds not only for the worst abuses of human beings, from mass murders to rapes to indifference toward disease and other terrible calamities, but they are invitations to terrorists to find refuge amidst the chaos. And anyone who thinks that our interest in Africa is only humanitarian, I think, misses the strategic import of the comments you made. And I do look forward to working with you. ISAKSON: My last question. If you ask the average Georgia what's the one thing they have the most consternation about, it's how much money we spend in foreign aid. And although as a percentage of the budget, it's a small number, a lot of the stories that get published raise questions about it. Talking about preconditions for a second, I am one that feels like foreign aid invested, especially with preconditions for results is beneficial to the United States of America. And I shared with you the issue on women's education in Muslim countries Africa who, prior to 2001, we weren't really aware that we had money going to NGOs than going to education. It was only teaching Muslim men, not Muslim women. And we put a precondition post-9/11 and built schools for women in Egypt and Ethiopia and other places. And the payback has been a renaissance in those countries, at least, in raising the educational level of all. I'd appreciate your comments on the extent to which preconditions can be used in foreign aid -- not preconditions to agree with us but preconditions to see that the result brings about a benefit like, in this case, the education of women. CLINTON: Well, I think that has been an important contribution to the foreign aid debate by this administration, you know, most manifest with the Millennium Challenge Corporation. I think we're still finding our way trying it figure out the best practices to use to encourage governments to act in certain ways, conditioning our aid. But I really believe this holds tremendous promise. And, again, it's an area that I would like to work with this committee on because there's a lot of expertise here. When you look at foreign aid, we want to be able to justify the investment to the American people and we want to get measurable results. CLINTON: Those are two goals that really go hand in hand. And so I believe strongly that as we try to shore up foreign aid, as we try to make the case for more development assistance, as we try to, you know, get back some of the authority and the resources that have drifted to the Defense Department, that we have to be ready to make that case. And I think the, you know, conditional aid approach in certain countries and situations is one we have to look at more closely. ISAKSON: Well, I appreciate your willingness to serve, and I wish you the best of luck in your tenure. Thank you. CLINTON: Thank you. KERRY: Thank you very much, Senator Isakson. Senator Casey? CASEY: Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. And I want to commend you on the new leadership position that you take, and we're grateful for your service. Senator Clinton, thank you very much for putting yourself forward to do a difficult job at a difficult time in our nation's history and for the time you're spending today. You're getting close to the end here. When you get down to this end to the table, it's -- we're kind of rounding the corner. And I want to stay within my time limits, because my friend here needs his time -- Jim Webb. I wanted to read you a statement that you're -- I think you're familiar with, but I think it -- it bears some emphasis today in light of what you said in your statement, in light of a lot of our concerns about the way foreign policy has been conduct, especially over the last eight years. The person who made this statement first made reference to our institutions of diplomacy and development being undermanned and underfunded. And then I'll pick up with a quotation, and it starts this way, "When it comes to America's engagement with the rest of the world, it's important that the military is in a supporting role" -- supporting role -- "to civilian agencies. Our diplomatic leaders must have the resources and political support needed to fully exercise their statutory responsibilities in leading American foreign policy. To truly harness the full strength of America requires having civilian institutions of diplomacy and development that are adequately staffed and properly funded," unquote. The person who made that statement was Secretary Gates this past July. And I wanted, in light of the discussion here today -- and I'm grateful for the -- the time you spent in your statement on this -- but also in light of what you and I have talked about in our meeting and in other conversations -- tell us how you're going to be working with Secretary Gates to make sure that we can give meaning and integrity to that -- to that observation that he made in that speech in July. CLINTON: Well, Senator Casey, it's a tremendous honor for me to be working with Secretary Gates. He has a very long history of service in our country and has worked with I don't know how many presidents -- six, maybe seven. But he has a broad, comprehensive view about what works for America and what doesn't. And he was in the, you know, real vanguard in the CIA and the National Security Council at the height of the Cold War. So his experience is especially valuable, and I know the president-elect believes that and, as you know, asked him to stay on. I've had several conversations with him already, and what you read is exactly what he believes, that we are going to be stronger if we are better able to promote diplomacy and development, not just rely on our military power. There's a lot of work to be done between that belief, which he and I and the president-elect share, and actually realizing its promise. We have work to do at the State Department. You know, part of the reason functions and resources have migrated is because there's just a presumption that the -- you know, the military can move much quicker and with greater effort, impose development or negotiate agreements -- whatever it might be -- than the State Department. And it's going to be our job to prove that, you know, the -- the State Department is not only substantively strong -- which, indeed, it is -- not only experienced in diplomacy and development -- which, indeed, it is -- but can, in this 21st century, move with dispatch, be results-oriented, create an atmosphere of collegiality and cooperation across the State Department and USAID and across the United States government. So I am taking this very seriously. I'm working with Secretary Gates. He's very open to cooperative efforts. But we have to prove that we can shoulder this responsibility, like stabilization and reconstruction and the new civilian corps, like, you know, really, outcomes-oriented development aid that can be done quickly without enormous bureaucracy. So we're going to take that challenge on, because I don't think we have a choice. I think that our foreign policy has gotten way out of balance. Secretary Gates knows it. The president-elect certainly knows it. So it's going to be up to us to try to get back into more equilibrium, which will be good for our government and for the image of our country around the world. CASEY: Well, we want to support you in that -- in that objective, in meeting that objective. And I do want to commend you -- we had a discussion the other day about the -- the mechanics of running such a -- a massive agency, and I know we don't have a lot of time today, but I wanted to commend you on appointing Jack Lew as deputy secretary for management. I think it's important that when someone is assuming the responsibilities you are that you -- you've spent the kind of time you have to -- to put together a team that can help you run the department. I wanted to move to two -- one or two more issues before my time expires. One is on an issue that I've worked with Senator Lugar on, the ranking member, as well as other members of this committee have worked for years -- Senator Biden worked hard on this as well as others. And that's the challenge posed by nuclear terrorism. As great as the challenge and the threat is, we know from our history and from our -- from our research that it's a preventable catastrophe, if we take the right steps not just here but around the world. And I just want to get your thoughts on the steps we need to take, which will involve a number of departments of our federal government, but the State Department under your leadership will play a significant role in working with other countries to identify fissile material and to prevent its -- prevent it from getting in the hands of the wrong people. CLINTON: Well, Senator Casey, I know you expressed to me your -- your deep concern about this and your desire to get very involved in helping us craft an effective approach to protecting our country and our allies and, indeed, humanity from weapons of mass destruction in the hands of terrorists. The recent commission on WMD chaired by former Senators Graham and Talent was very sobering. Basically, they concluded that the evidence points to our seeing a terrorist attack using nuclear or biological materials some time in the next four years. You add to that the growing threat of cyber terrorism, which has the potential of disrupting the networks we rely on for all kinds of things, like traffic signals and electric grids and the like, which would be incredibly disruptive and dangerous -- I mean, this is the number one threat we face, there's no doubt in my mind. So we're going to start calling it such. We're going to reorganize the department to be better prepared to deal with nonproliferation, arms control and these new threats. I look forward to working closely with this committee to get the best people we can into the State Department, to work with our partners across the United States government, and to send out a message loudly and clearly that the United States wants to be a leader once again, to control arms, particularly with Russia, and that's what the START talks will be aimed at doing, and to be much more aggressive in going after nonproliferation. So this is our -- our very highest priority, because the consequences are so devastating. CASEY: And I know it -- one more question. We -- in -- in the time I have. We spoke a little bit the other day about the challenge that Pakistan presents to -- to all of us, to the American people but also to the world, for a lot of reasons, we know, not only because of the -- the threat in the border region between Pakistan and Afghanistan, the concern about the rivalry -- and that's an understatement -- with -- with India, and the question of whether this government will really take a -- make it a priority to root out the -- the extremist elements that are throughout different parts of Pakistan and the region. And finally, the nuclear -- the concern about the stability of their nuclear command and control -- coming into the office -- and I realize you're just starting, but what's -- how do you think we need to approach it from the State Department's point of view and in meeting those -- or being focused on those various concerns that I just outlined? CLINTON: Well, as I stated in my opening remarks, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Middle East remain in the forefront of the challenges that the new administration will face. Pakistan has a particular complexity because of its nuclear weapons capacity. But the democratically elected government has been saying a lot of the right things with respect to the threat posed by the extremists and terrorists, particularly along the border and in the FATA region in Pakistan. So I'm -- I'm hopeful that we will have a very active, positive relationship with the new Pakistan government. I know that there's a lot of work being done even by the outgoing administration to deepen ties between our country and various institutions in Pakistan. But this is a tough problem, Senator. I mean, this is a very complicated problem. It has many dimensions to it -- as you pointed out, the relationship with India, the relationship with Afghanistan, the role that Iran and others are playing in that region. We have to approach this with the same level of attention and comprehensive understanding that our military is attempting to do as it ramps up our troop commitments in Afghanistan and works more closely with the government of Pakistan to protect them from violent extremists as well as to root out Al Qaida and other remnants of the terrorist networks so that they don't find safe haven in Pakistan to plan attacks against us or any other country. CASEY: Thank you very much. KERRY: Thank you very much, Senator Casey. Senator Vitter? VITTER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and congratulations on your new chairmanship. KERRY: Thank you very much. VITTER: And thank you, Senator Clinton, for all of your public service, including being open to this very challenging position. Like a lot of folks, I have some concerns about these conflict issues, particularly with regard to the Clinton Foundation, and so I wanted to spend my first round exploring those concerns. Let me say a couple things -- first, that I think a lot of folks legitimately share these concerns across the spectrum, from the -- from the New York Times to Senator Lugar, who submitted some questions about it to me. That -- that perhaps defines the entire political spectrum. I'm not sure. And also, they arise because of very extraordinary circumstances, your husband being a former president, his very unique work in terms of the foundation, and -- and in terms of that work -- I applaud that, but they nevertheless arise because of that, and I think it really requires an extraordinary response. Obviously, you all have put forward this memorandum of understanding to suggest that such a response -- and so I wanted to go into that and some of the details about it and some of my concerns. And -- and these posters just sort of briefly outline the situation before the MOU with the foundation, and those -- all those abbreviations are the ones used in the MOU, and then the situation after. One thing that sort of leaped out at me is with regard to the Clinton Global Initiative, which in many ways is the most public and perhaps significant of these initiatives. Under the MOU, there's no disclosure of contributions, contributors, going forward. And that seems to be a big -- a big omission, because, again, that's one of the most significant activities here, probably the most widely followed and recognized in terms of the annual conference, et cetera. Would you support and help produce an amended MOU that would bring the same disclosure to future contributions to the Clinton Global Initiative? VITTER: Well, Senator, I -- I appreciate your concern, and your question, and -- and I recognize that these are unique circumstances, to say the least. CLINTON: I am very proud to be the president-elect's nominee for secretary of state, and I am very proud of what my husband and the Clinton Foundation and the associated efforts he's undertaken have accomplished, as well. It is not unique, however, for spouses of government officials to work and there are very well established rules for what is expected when that occurs. In this particular case, the Office of Government Ethics and the career ethics officials at the State Department have looked at the rules and concluded there is not an inherent conflict of interest in any of my husband's work at all. However, the foundation and the president-elect decided to go beyond what the law and the ethics rules call for to address even the appearance of conflict and that is why they signed a memorandum of understanding, which outlines the voluntary steps that the foundation is taking to address potential concerns that might come up down the road. The memorandum of understanding is, as you know, public and the president-elect and the foundation and I have all worked to be very transparent. My team has stayed in close touch with the committee and we've addressed the committee's questions on these issues in a broad range of written answers which are part of the so-called QFRs, the questions for the record. But I want to speak for a minute, if I can, about the work that is done, because I think it's important... VITTER: Mr. Chairman, I have no objection listening to this, but I'd like it not to come out of my time, because I'd like to pursue these questions. KERRY: Well, I guess it's fair to say that if you ask a question, you deserve an answer and the answer traditionally comes out of the time of the Senator. VITTER: Well, I'm still waiting for the answer. I'd love an answer. But if there is an answer to my question... KERRY: Well, I think you need to give the Senator an opportunity to give you the answer and if you need additional time... VITTER: Let me repeat the question, which was would you support and help produce a new MOU that requires the same sort of disclosure for contributions for the Clinton Global Initiative. Under this, there is no disclosure moving forward for contributions of the Clinton Global Initiative. So it's a yes or no. Would you support expanding that disclosure? Admittedly, this is voluntary. It's not required by law. But it seems to be a big exception to the rule of the MOU in terms of disclosure. CLINTON: Well, I think that the MOU and the other undertakings that have been worked out between the president-elect and the transition and the foundation and my husband have looked very broadly at all of the questions that you're raising, and there are answers to many of these questions in the collection of answers that we have provided. And I will be happy to provide additional material and answers to you in response to that question. VITTER: OK. Well, if you could consider that suggestion, I think that's a big gap in the MOU that moving forward, the Clinton Global Initiative is separated from the foundation and then there's no disclosure whatsoever about contributors to the Clinton Global Initiative. The other big gap, it seems to me, is that the disclosure in the MOU is for new contributors. And so old contributors who re-give or who even substantially increase their contributions, if it's to certain initiatives, aren't disclosed. Would you consider amending that so that all contributions, whether from new contributors or old contributors, would be disclosed? CLINTON: All contributors will be disclosed and all contributors to the Clinton Global Initiative are disclosed and public as of now anyway. VITTER: OK, but that changes under the MOU. CLINTON: No. KERRY: If I could just interrupt, Senator. I think if you look at the MOU and you look at the subsequent questions that were answered by the Senator to the committee, because we followed up on this issue, I believe that all -- we asked the question, "Will all future contributions to the foundation be disclosed," and... VITTER: To the foundation? KERRY: That's the foundation, but in addition, it's my understanding that under the MOU, the CGI additionally, if there are contributions, they would be disclosed at the end of the year. CLINTON: That's right. VITTER: OK. I'm very happy to hear that. That's not what's in the MOU. So if I could simply request, before our vote, a document or an amendment from the transition and the foundation that clarify that, because under the MOU, moving forward, the Clinton Global Initiative is separated from the foundation and then there's disclosure under the foundation. CLINTON: Well, Senator, I believe that all the answers that are relevant to these inquiries are in the record. There is no intention to amend the MOU. It has been worked out between the transition and the foundation. But the Clinton Global Initiative is a pass-through. The money of any donors to put on the Clinton Global Initiative are public and there is no ongoing -- you know, the foundation is a yearly event. It's unlike the foundation. So we will clarify it. We will definitely clarify that for you. VITTER: Well, it would be great if you can clarify it. Again, I don't want to beat a dead horse, but under the MOU, as it stands, there is no required disclosure going forward for Clinton Global Initiative contributions and there is no necessary required disclosure for new contributions of old contributors, just new contributors. There's also been the suggestion from a lot of folks to disclose the date and amount or at least amount within ranges of new contributions and to do that at least quarterly rather than annually. Would you be open to that? CLINTON: Well, again, this is an agreement that has been worked out between all of the parties and the fact is that the concerns that were raised in the discussions between the foundation and the president-elect's team were thoroughly discussed and they believe, and I agree, that the transparency and disclosure that is needed, which, as you said yourself, it goes beyond any kind of legal or ethical consideration. And not only that, there will be ongoing -- there will be ongoing reviews by anything that is brought to the attention of the career professionals. But I just have to go back, Senator, and try to set the record straight. CGI is not in the memorandum of understanding because they already have a practice of disclosing all of their contributions. There is no need to require it. I will certainly state here that they're going to continue the practice which they've already done. No president has ever disclosed the contributions to his foundation. So when my husband agreed to disclose the contributions to his foundation, that was a very unprecedented event, which he was happy to do. But the Clinton Global Initiative, which is separate from the foundation, has always disclosed the contributions. VITTER: Well, again, I'd love for that to be embodied in any agreement that's at issue. So I'll look forward to that. KERRY: Well, Senator, can I just -- this won't come out of your time, but let me make sure the record is clear here. As I understand it, I think Senator Lugar has raised a couple points and we're going to address them perhaps a little bit later, but I don't think this one, frankly, is on target, for the following reason. On page four, paragraph two, it specifically says that CGI, President Clinton personally will not solicit funds. President Clinton will continue to send invitation letters to potential entity. However, he will no longer send sponsorship letters which seek contributions. Apart from attendance fees, CGI will not accept contributions from foreign governments. So there is no solicitation and no acceptance of a foreign government. VITTER: But, for instance, there could be foreign national contributions, which, within the four corners of this agreement, are not disclosed, not necessarily disclosed. I mean, my question is, in that same paragraph, why isn't there a disclosure requirement. KERRY: Well, I think the Senator has appropriately said that they will answer that in the addendum. VITTER: I'd look forward to that, as well as the old contributor issue, because it just talks about new contributors. Again, let me back up and underscore the central concern, which is I really do think this poses a lot of real and perceived conflict issues and you just need to look at some of the contributors from the past, particularly from the Middle East, to get a sense of what I'm talking about. For instance, a lobby foundation supports Iranian causes. Just this past December 19, they made a substantial contribution to the foundation and that same day, the president of the foundation was indicted for obstruction of justice related to terrorist financing. And two days earlier, Treasury had named a partner of the foundation as a, quote, "terrorist entity." Another partner of the foundation, Bank Melli, has long been thought to be a procurement front for the Iranian nuclear program. That's the sort of big issue, conflict issue that I think this poses, which could obviously complicate your job and be an impediment to your effectiveness. Another similar example, Issam Fares, former deputy prime minister of Lebanon, he's a big supporter of Hezbollah, says it's not in any way a terrorist organization, doesn't target the U.S. I'm sure the widows and family members of the victims of the 1983 Beirut bombing that killed 241 Americans were comforted by that. Obviously, they are terrorists, they do target the U.S. This poses serious issues. So I look forward to following-up and getting that clarification and, also, I think it would round out this agreement immeasurably to include the date and amount of contributions, to pledges made, not simply have disclosures when a payment is made, and to at least do quarterly reports versus annual reports. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. KERRY: Thank you very much, Senator Vitter. Senator Webb? WEBB: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Clinton, I've had the pleasure of having sat through this entire hearing today -- I'm not sure you have found it very pleasurable -- partly because I'm really interested in these issues and partly because I'm so far down the food chain that I had to wait until 3 o'clock this afternoon to ask my questions. It's nice to have Senator Shahim (ph) on my left, finally have somebody I'm a little -- and I'm very impressed by the range that you have shown here on a wide variety of issues that have been thrown at you. I've had the pleasure of working with you and discussing these issues over the past years, but I think you've done a marvelous job today. I guess the phrase of the week is "smart power." I've been doing this a long time, in and out of government. People come up with different phrases. I think the most important thing that you have said is in your statement, your opening statement, when you mentioned that the goal of this administration is going to be more partners and fewer adversaries and to do so in a realistic way that still protects the interests of the United States, and I think that will be a major demarcation for our government as we relate to the rest of the world. You and I have had many conversations over the years. This is a time that the context of these conversations are going to be shaped into what I believe will be achievable policies. I would like to list, very quickly, for the record, six or seven areas where I believe that these conversations will need to continue and, in some cases, there will probably be debates, but I think that it's important to outline these. The first is the nature of the residual force in Iraq or even whether there should be a residual force in Iraq and how that situation would assist us in increasing stability in the region. You mentioned the SOFA and the strategic framework agreement as national policy. As you know, I had a great deal of heartburn over the way that those agreements were signed here. They were approved by the Iraqi parliament. We in the Congress did not even have an opportunity to vote on whether this was the way to proceed forward. I don't anticipate that situation coming up again. The second is the need for a clearly articulated strategy with respect to Afghanistan and Pakistan. And we don't have a strategy unless we can articulate the endpoint and I look forward to working with you toward not only being able to define that, but being able to define some sort of an achievable endpoint to our presence in Afghanistan. The third is a reexamination of the way that we have proceeded with NATO expansion. I did a lot of work in NATO when I was assistant secretary of defense and, quite frankly, this isn't the NATO that I was working with and I'm very concerned about the transition from essentially alliances into a number of protectorates in these newer countries and that's a situation that makes our country, I believe, very vulnerable. The fourth is a need for us to adjust our strategic relationship with China. There have been a lot of... (AUDIO GAP) FEINGOLD: ... the State Department policy that make it difficult for the partners and foreign service officers to travel and live at an overseas post. What would you do as secretary of state to address these concerns? Will you support changes to existing personnel policy in order to ensure that LGBT staff at State and USAID receive equal benefits and support? CLINTON: Senator, this issue was brought to my attention during the transition. I've asked to have more briefing on it because I think that we should take a hard look at the existing policy. As I understand it, but don't hold me to it because I don't have the full briefing material, but my understanding is other nations have moved to extend that partnership benefit. And we will come back to you to inform you of decisions we make going forward. FEINGOLD: Thank you, Senator. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. KERRY: Thank you very much. Thanks, Senator. Well, we're sort of getting to that point now where I think we can address some loose ends and maybe even, you know, sort of have some fun and dig into things a little bit here in ways that we can't otherwise. But we promise not to prolong it. And we'll try and remain focused on those things that are really salient here. Let me begin with Afghanistan, if I may. I am deeply concerned that, at least thus far, our policy in Afghanistan has kind of been on automatic. And I made a promise to myself a long time ago that I would not see all of our conflicts, ground operations in the context of Vietnam. I really try hard. I have an automatic check that says, you know, not everything is that. But I have to tell you, in the several visits I have now made, escape it as I might, the parallels just really keep leaping out in so many different ways. We are struggling to fight with and for people with a different culture, a different language, different custom, different history, different religion, if any. And all of those similarities exist. We don't live there. We don't live in the community, in a hamlet, in a small town, pocket, whatever you want to call it. And so we're not there often at night. They are. And the night often rules with insurgencies. The complications are profound in both Pakistan and Afghanistan. And I went to both -- and to India -- immediately after Mumbai and was really struck by the extraordinary distance we have to travel in both places, Senator. That is the center of the war on -- I've got check myself. I hope this administration and all of us will begin to think differently in this terminology of war on terror and think in terms of the global counterinsurgency and the difference between counterinsurgency and counterterrorism and the challenges that we face in addressing both and understanding them both. One person made a very interesting comment to me while I was over there and said, you know, Pakistan is a government without a country, and Afghanistan is a country without a government. And if you stop and think about -- so the real application -- and no insult meant to anybody. President Karzai is a friend. We've all met with him. We want his success. But there are inherent contradictions in the structure that we have been trying to impose in Afghanistan. And more and more, as I travel that part of the world -- I served most recently as chair of the Subcommittee on Mideast, South Asia -- so I was frequently there. It left -- it kept leaping out at me in ways that, over a number of years here, I really, frankly had not given enough consideration to. But recently read a wonderful book when I commend to you by Rory Stewart, you know, "The Places in Between" and another book, "The Forever War" and a whole host of them that really give you the flavor of this if you really want it -- I mean, "Gertrude Bell, the Desert Queen" is a fascinating study of sort of the region and of tribalism. And that's really what I want to point to. We have not, I think -- we honored tribalism when we dealt with the Northern Alliance and initially went in to Afghanistan. We really haven't adequately since. And it strikes me that if we just put troops, plunk them down, another 20, 30,000 in Afghanistan, without very limited view of what they can achieve and need to do and a comprehensive view of other things we need to do to build the successful structures of governance -- the police, the judiciary which may be a pipe dream, the construction programs, the ability of Hamid Karzai's government, as well intentioned as he may be and as much as we like him, the ability to even get out of Kabul and be able to do anything in the countryside, I think -- Madam Secretary Designate, we're on the wrong track. And I think unless we rethink this very, very carefully, we could raise the stakes, invest America's reputation in a greater way as well as our treasure and wind up pursuing a policy that is, frankly, unpursuable, unachievable. So I'd like to elicit your thoughts on this. I was in Pasharah (ph) a few weeks ago. I learned that -- and some in Pakistan would disagree with this, and I'll probably hear from some of my friend there. But many people believe that it would not be hard for the Taliban to move in there if that's the decision they decided to make. It was so dangerous that we were not able to move into the downtown and other areas. And we just saw last week 600 Taliban cross the border from Afghanistan and came in and directly attacked a frontier corps military outpost. I have anybody who has really traveled on the ground, listened in the right ways, and not just accepted the sort of briefing culture will suggest to you respectfully, Madam Secretary, this really has to be rethought very, very carefully. Our original goal was to go in there and take on Al Qaeda. It was to capture or kill Osama bin Laden. It was not to adopt the 51st state of the United States. It was not to try to impose a form of government, no matter how much we believe in it and support it, but that is -- that is the mission, at least, as it is being defined today. So I'd like to ask for your thoughts on this as you engage in what will, obviously, be a hasty and important critical review and some judgments that we need to make about our policy. CLINTON: Well, Mr. Chairman, I think that your cautions are extremely well taken. There is, as you know, a review going on right now under the direction of General Petraeus through CENTCOM. If I understand it, he has approximately 300 people, some of them detailees from the State Department, who are crisscrossing Afghanistan trying to determine, as I understand it, what is and isn't feasible. We are in close communication with General Petraeus. We intend to, when it's appropriate on January 20th, to begin our own immediate review because I share your concern as I know the president-elect does. You know, his approach toward Afghanistan, which is has been more for more -- you know, more troops would go in but there would have to be more from NATO and there would have to be more from Afghanistan -- you know, presupposes that we have a set of discreet goals that we are trying to achieve. And that is in the process of being assessed and analyzed right now. As you're aware, President Bush had inside the White House General Lute, who was largely responsible for coordinating policy with respect to both Iraq and Afghanistan. So the Bush administration has put a lot of assets to work on trying to determine what is the best way forward with Afghanistan and how do we affect the future of Pakistan, the decisions that they make. But I think that asking the hard questions and raising the red flags is exactly what this committee I know will do and should do. Sitting here today, when I think about my trips to Afghanistan, my flying over that terrain, my awareness of the history going back to Alexander the Great and, certainly, the imperial British military and Rudyard Kipling's memorable poems about Afghanistan, the Soviet Union, which put in more troops than we're thinking about putting in -- I mean, it calls for a large doze of humility about what it is we are trying to accomplish. Having said that, I think that we will keep you informed as we move forward. And on the civilian side, I hope that we will have the opportunity for more in-depth conversations. I mean, I've been on both sides now of the table here. And there is so much to discuss, and there is so much expertise on this committee -- people who have traveled widely, thought deeply, know a lot of the players. And I hope that, you know, if I am confirmed, that I'll be able to have you and others literally sitting down and talking with the people that we're going to be tasking to come up with the civilian side of this strategy so that we go in with our eye open, whatever it is we're trying to achieve. KERRY: Well, I really appreciate that. I don't expect you to be able to lay out that strategy now. I would say that I think it's important, perhaps, for the administration -- the incoming administration -- to not just have the review process that's been put in place be the only standard for a baseline. And I think we need to make certain that there's a subsequent expectation with regard to that. I think it would be a mistake to just do that. I think you probably agree with that. Secondly, with respect to the current military operations, I spent a lot of time in a couple of briefings that we're not allowed to discuss in public here. But trying to really get at this question of the targeting with respect to the Pakistan, the Fatah, and our efforts to take out terrorists in that area. There has been a considerable blow-back and, I think, counterproductivity in the collateral damage that has been occurring there. And I hope that you would also agree to really dig into that and take a look at whether or not all of that, the targeting, is in fact as purported to be and as important as is suggested because I think we're creating some terrorists and losing some ground in the effort to win the hearts and minds as they say. CLINTON: Yes, sir. KERRY: On the situation with Pakistan, they not only face the challenge of the insurgency in the country; they have a dire economic crisis also. And in many ways, the economic crisis may be just as challenging. We, after I went over with Senator Biden and Senator Hagel last year, we came back and propped a tripling of the aid to $1.5 billion a year over the course of a number of years. And I wonder, can you say today that the administration is -- remaining absolutely committed to that because we want to try to move that as rapidly as we can? CLINTON: Yes. The president-elect does support the regulation that you were part of and Vice President-elect Biden and, I think, Senator Lugar was as well. KERRY: Correct. CLINTON: And we want it try to begin, to some extent, to separate our military aid from our non-military aid. The tripling of the non-military aid is intended to provide resources that will both support the Pakistani people but also give some tools to the democratically-elected government to try to start producing results for the people of Pakistan. The military aid, we want to, you know, really look hard at seeing whether we can condition some of that on the commitment for the counterinsurgency, counterterrorism missions. So we certainly are inclined to support, when appropriate, the legislation that you were referring to. KERRY: And this is going to take a very significant hands-on effort, as I think you know. We've been, obviously, reading about or hearing about the potential of special envoys, as series of them. Do you want to address that at all today? CLINTON: Well, no final decisions have been made. That is a tool that I think you will see more use of. I believe that special envoys, particularly, vis a vis military commands, have a lot to recommend in order to make sure that we've got the civilian presence well represented. (AUDIO GAP) CLINTON: ... because all of the independent professionals who do this for our government said there was no conflict. So it's a kind of a catch-as-catch-can problem. I mean, when it was all submitted to the Office of Government Ethics, they said there was no inherent conflict. My husband doesn't take a salary. He has no financial interests in any of this. I don't take a salary. I have no financial interests. So out of that abundance of caution and a desire to avoid even the appearance, the president-elect's transition team began working with the foundation to try to craft an agreement that would avoid the appearance of a conflict but would also ensure that the foundation can continue its work. You know, I'm very proud of the work that the foundation did. And when you look at why it received, for example, foreign government money, it's because early on there wasn't the support from our government until, frankly, the leadership of President Bush and members of this Congress created PEPFAR. And there was also a tremendous financial burden on poor states to try to afford the pharmaceuticals, the anti-retro-virals. So my husband's foundation worked with generic drug manufacturers to help improve their systems of manufacturing and get the cost down so that it would be affordable. So the governments of countries like Canada, Norway, and Ireland and the UN said, well, this is the best deal ever. So this is all passed-through money. None of this goes to or stays in the foundation. This is used for the purchasing contracts in order to buy the drugs to keep, you know, many people alive and, particularly, about 1.4 million people including many children. So the work of the foundation, the confidence that it has created with donors who know that it has an extremely low percentage that goes to any overhead. It has a very transparent way that it uses the money. We're very persuasive to the transition team that we had to work out something to keep the foundation in business while I did what I needed to do to be as transparent as possible. So the kinds of concerns that were put forth were very carefully considered. And, you know, I do believe that the agreement provides the kind of transparency under the memorandum of understanding, foreign government pledges will be submitted to the State Department for review. I don't know who will be giving money. That will not influence, it was not be in the atmosphere. When the disclosure occurs, obviously, it was be after the fact. So it would be hard to make an argument that it influenced anybody because we don't know about it. So I think that, in a way, the president-elect's transition team saw the agreement that has been worked out is actually in the best interests of avoiding the appearance of conflict. Now, I hasten to say that my career in public service is hardly free of conflict, Senator. So I have no illusions about the fact that no matter what we do there will be those who will raise conflicts. But I can absolutely guarantee you that I will keep a very close look on how this is being implemented. I will certainly do everything in my power to make sure that the good work of the foundation continues without there being any untoward effects on me and my service and be very conscious of any questions that are raised. But I think that the way that this has been hammered out is probably as close as we can get to doing something that is so unprecedented that there is no formula for it. And we've tried to do the very best we could. LUGAR: Well, my time is concluded. But let me just say that the situation is unprecedented when a first lady and her distinguished husband and a foundation come together with a State Department hearing of this sort. I am hopeful that, as we go through the history of this, that people will not say, well, Senator Lugar, Senator Kerry, and others were pressing it. They saw the problems. And we'll get full credit, but that will not be helpful to our foreign policy, to you, to your husband, to the foundation. This is why I plea for you, really, to give even more consideration -- it may not be a decision made today because I appreciate the negotiations have been sizeable. And you are a good negotiator and so is your husband. So are those who have worked for you. I admire that. It's a good things for a State Department official and, particularly, the secretary of state. But this seems to me to be so important at the outset. This is why I've dwelled upon it, trying your patience and that of the committee, because I think it is very important. And I think you understand that. CLINTON: I do. And I respect you so much, Senator. And I can, you know, certainly guarantee to you that I will remain very sensitive to this and I will work with you and the chairman as we go forward. LUGAR: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. KERRY: Thank you very much, Senator Lugar. Let me take a moment to welcome Senator Shaheen. This is her first official formal appearance with the committee. We just ratified the assignments at lunch today. And so we're delighted to have you here. I'm personally delighted because you're a great friend and a good neighbor. And we're really happy to have you as a member of this committee. SHAHEEN: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I am very honored to be able to serve on this prestigious committee with you and Senator Lugar. And as I'm sure you know, I have been a big fan of your public service to the country for a very long time as well as your broad knowledge and expertise in this area. And just as this country faces unprecedented economic challenges, we also face the most complicated foreign relations and national security challenges since the end of the Cold War. And I know that under your leadership and the leadership of Senator Lugar that this committee will address these vital issues in a bipartisan way. And I'm delighted to be able to serve with you as we do that. Senator Clinton, congratulations on your terrific nomination. Your testimony this morning, I thought, reinforced the fact that you have a breadth of knowledge and experience to be an outstanding secretary of state. And I commend President-elect Obama for choosing you. The two of you working in a partnership will truly have the opportunity to change the world. And I have no doubt that you will do that. On a personal note, I have to say that I am disappointed that I won't be able to serve with you in the Senate but look forward to working with you as a member of this committee. I have two questions since you have covered many of the issues that I would have asked. One is a broader question and the other is a little more parochial relative to New Hampshire. The first has to do with the international economy. And I know that you and Senator Dodd discussed this a little bit earlier today. But over one-fifth of the manufacturing workers in my state of New Hampshire depend on exports for their jobs. I was interested to see recent reports that you would like to see the State Department take a more active role on questions of international economics. And I thought that would certainly be a change from the Bush administration, which has placed the international economic agenda primarily in the Department of Treasury. So a wondered if you could speak a little bit to the role that you see for the State Department in addressing these economic -- international economic issues. CLINTON: Well, Senator Shaheen, welcome to the Senate and welcome to this committee. I think your joining this body will be an incredible addition and I look forward to working with you in this new capacity. I, to, regret that we won't serve together as senators, but I'm glad you're on this committee so that we can continue our friendship. I think that's a really timely question. And it is one of the concerns that I have explored since being asked to take this position. How do we get our economic international agenda better integrated into the State Department? Obviously, Treasury has a huge role to play, but so does the State Department. And, you know, we're going to be responsible for the climate change negotiations. Well, you know, that has economic, environmental, and energy-related implications. The questions earlier from Senator Lugar about energy security -- huge economic implications. And then the meltdown of the international economic regulatory system means that our foreign policy is impacted in so many ways in so many parts of the world. So there is a lot that we have to pay attention to. And we have a National Security Council, but we also have a National Economic Council. And it will be part of the Obama administration's plans that the State Department will participate in both, not just one; that we will be very much involved in the crafting of international economic efforts. The G-20, which will be coming up in April, hosted by Prime Minister Gordon Brown in London, we're going to be playing a role in helping to, you know, design the agenda for that. So on all of these issues, I think it is important to have a broader approach than just, you know, one agency because our economic standing effects everything we're doing. You know, dealing with Russia on START -- you know, some of that will be influenced by the economic situation that we're confronting. Trying to deal with the modernization of the military in China -- we've got to have a strategic relationship, as Senator Webb said, but we also have to make sure that they continue buying our debt. I mean, we have a lot of very complicated international economic issues that directly impact our foreign policy. So we're going to be working on those. And I welcome any and all advice that you might have. SHAHEEN: Thank you. The second question is related somewhat, and it deals with trade. We have a company in New Hampshire -- and forgive me for being parochial -- called Goss International that makes large printing presses. They had Japan come in and dump imports into the market. They went to court and sued under our trade laws and got a judgment in U.S. district court. And Japan retaliated by passing a recovery or a claw back that allowed the company that was doing the dumping to actually appropriate Goss' investments in Japan. And the State Department has really done very little to address this issue in a way that -- despite the court judgment on behalf of the American company. So what role do you see the State Department playing as companies like Goss are dealing with this violation of U.S. trade laws? CLINTON: Well, I don't know anything about that specific case. We will look into that and educate ourselves about it. But more generally, I think this has to be part of our broader trade discussions. The president-elect is in favor of free and fair trade. He wants to figure out how trade becomes more of a win-win for our manufacturers, our businesses, you know, our citizens. And that's going to be part of what we look at. What are the rules that we want to enforce in our country? And what do we expect through reciprocal relations with other countries? So I'm well familiar with the general nature of the problem because I faced much of this in New York over the last eight years. But we're going to try to be more creative and substantive in addressing what we can do to create a more favorable, positive atmosphere so that, if there are violations, they can immediately be taken care of within the global trading framework and you don't face retaliation and you don't have to worry about unfair competition. SHAHEEN: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. KERRY: Thank you very much, Senator. Senator Barrasso? BARRASSO: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And congratulations, Senator Clinton. We've worked together on the Superfund Committee you chaired and I was the ranking Republican. And I always found you to be very prepared, very thorough, very thoughtful. And I'm sure you're going bring all of those same things to the State Department. CLINTON: Thank you very much. BARRASSO: Senator Shaheen was apologizing for being parochial. I will be a little parochial because the people of Wyoming, as a travel around, want to make sure that our -- the foreign aid that we spend, especially in light of the U.S. economy today, is being used so that people are really getting value for their money and that we are safeguarding the U.S. taxpayer dollars. Could you talk a little bit about how to balance allocating foreign aid and making sure that American taxpayers are getting value for their money? CLINTON: Well, Senator, I appreciate very much your interest in these issues, and I have enjoyed my relationship with you since you arrived in the Senate. And I look forward to working with you. I want to be able to go to Wyoming or go to New York or Massachusetts or Indiana or New Hampshire or anywhere in America and explain why the relatively small but important amount of money we do spend on foreign aid is in the best interests of the American people; that it promotes our national security and advances our interests and reflects our values. To be able to do that, I have to make sure the State Department and I, in particular, tell the story about what we do and why. I mean, you and other members of this committee often travel and see the results of the work, but it's very difficult to convey that to the rest of our country. And I will look for better ways through public diplomacy in telling our story overseas and better ways here at home through my own efforts to explain what we do to our fellow Americans. But I think it also has to be part of an overall review of how we conduct foreign aid, how we fund it, who's responsible for it, which is why I decided to have the second deputy, Jack Lew, that -- who'll be responsible for resources and management, because I want somebody to be able to come up and talk with you about very specific ideas we have about how to make foreign aid more effective. It's pretty divided, and I think we have degraded the capacity of USAID over the last years to be our premiere aid development organization. And a lot of what's been drifting toward the Defense Department, as Senator Webb said, is -- is foreign aid in a traditional way. When a young Army captain gets cash to go build a school, that's foreign aid. That's not war fighting. That's something that we always thought of as development assistance. So we've just got to do a better job of trying to explain and justify and rationalize and make efficient what we do, so that, you know, if I'm fortunate enough to come to Wyoming, and I can go to some town hall or forum with you, in a, you know, year or two, I'll be able to explain what we're doing, why we're doing it, and why it makes a difference to the people who are there. BARRASSO: Well, consider yourself invited. CLINTON: Thank you. BARRASSO: And the second question they'll ask is -- when you come is about management reform at the United Nations and the money that American taxpayers are spending there, and you -- do you have... CLINTON: Yes. BARRASSO: ... some thoughts on that? CLINTON: Well, this is another priority of the president-elect, and I know you'll be speaking with the permanent representative to the U.N.-designee in a day or two. The U.N. must reform. It -- it has to be more transparent, more efficient, and we are going to press for those kinds of changes. At the same time, the United States has to be a good partner with the U.N. so that if we use the U.N., as we do, for peacekeeping or other actions that we believe are in the best interests of the United States as well as the United Nations, we're going to have to bear our burden. So this is really a two-track commitment. We've got to work with our -- our partners at the United Nations as well as the permanent bureaucracy there to do everything we can to try to streamline the operations, modernize the system, make them more transparent, and then we have to be sure we do our part so we don't lose credibility as we push that reform agenda. BARRASSO: Moving on to Iran -- and I know you've addressed it -- reading your article in Foreign Affairs, you said if Iran is, in fact, willing to end its nuclear program, renounce sponsorship of terrorism, support Middle East peace and play a constructive role in stabilizing Iraq, the United States should be prepared to offer Iran a carefully calibrated package of incentives. Do you have a clear path in your mind of how to get from where we are today, where Iran appears to be continuing toward the development of nuclear weapons, continues to spew forth hatred of Israel, to get to a point where -- where these things would apply? And how do we do that from -- from here? CLINTON: Well, Senator, there is a policy review that is being undertaken by the incoming administration. We are still being briefed by the outgoing administration. We don't yet have a full picture of all of the information that the current administration has within its control. So we will be working together across government lines, through the national security team, to devise a new approach. The president-elect called for such a new approach just over the weekend in some interviews that he did, and we are very open to, you know, looking to find a positive, effective way of engaging Iran. However, as I said to the chairman, a nuclear-armed Iran is not acceptable to the United States. It is our job to persuade other countries that it should not be acceptable to them either, to consult with our friends and allies in the Gulf who have as much or more at stake than anyone, and certainly with Israel, that views a nuclear- armed Iran as a grave threat, so that as we move forward with any new approach or effort at engagement we are bringing our friends and allies along with us, we're not surprising anybody, because Iran, with its litany of terrorist sponsorship and interference with other countries' internal affairs, and certainly the role that it's played destructively, from our view, in Iraq and so much else, as you know, is a concern not just for the United States and Israel. It's a deep concern to many other nations. And so we want a broad as base (sic) as possible as we try to devise a way forward. BARRASSO: Thank you. Could I shift a little bit to Cuba? As you know, right now we have strict laws and regulations limiting economic transactions with -- with Cuba, with relatives of folks who are here. Any thought on lifting restrictions on families to visit and send -- and send things to Cuba? CLINTON: Senator, the president-elect is committed to lifting the family travel restrictions and the remittance restrictions. He believes, and I think it's a very wise insight, that Cuban-Americans are the best ambassadors for democracy, freedom and a free market economy. And as they are able to travel back to see their families, that further makes the case as to the failures of the Castro regime -- the repression, the political denial of freedom, the political prisoners -- all of the very unfortunate actions that have been taken to hold the Cuban people back. You know, our policy is, first and foremost, about the freedom of the Cuban people and the bringing of democracy to the island of Cuba. We hope that the regime in Cuba, both Fidel and Raul Castro, will see this new administration as an opportunity to change some of their typical approaches. Let those political prisoners out. Be willing to, you know, open up the economy and lift some of the oppressive strictures on the people of Cuba. And I think they would see that there would be an opportunity that could be perhaps exploited. But that's in the future, whether or not they decide to make those changes. BARRASSO: OK. I appreciated some of the comments you made earlier about the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty and working with that, and I know you're working Senator Lugar there and others on the committee. You spoke strongly about verification and ongoing monitoring provisions to make sure that that continues. I wonder in these treaties about differentials in terms of what the United States gives up and others give up for us to agree to get signatures on that. Could you talk a little bit about that and what standards we will hold other countries and how we make sure that their understanding is the same as our understanding? CLINTON: Well, I think that's a very good point. You know, the history of arms control with first the Soviet Union and then Russia -- I think it's fair to say -- and of course, Senator Lugar is an expert on this -- has been a history of success, by and large. Even in the midst of the Cold War, there were negotiations that led to arms control agreements. And certainly, it is our hope that the United States can once again be a leader on reducing the number of warheads and the -- the threat of nuclear war, making sure that we have no remnants of Cold War command and control issues and the like. We are very serious about negotiating and are willing to go lower so long as the Russians are as well, and that the deterrent that we have we always believe is adequate. We won't really know, Senator, until we get into these negotiations, but they're going to be on a fast track, because the START agreement, as you know, expires at the end of this year, so we've got to get serious and get involved, and we will have a negotiator named so that we can start almost immediately. BARRASSO: Thank you, Senator Clinton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My time's expired. KERRY: Thank you very much, Senator. I'll take a round now, and then -- I see Senator Feingold is here. I don't know if there are any other folks who are going to look for a second round. If there aren't, then maybe I'll let Senator Feingold go, and then we'll just stay focused and wrap up on sort of a series of questions. Senator Feingold? FEINGOLD: Well, thanks much, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for your patience, Senator Clinton. Just a couple other topics. You and I discussed Somalia, and I've been long concerned about the deepening crisis there, particularly its implications for our national security. Just this last month, several senior officials, including CIA Director Hayden and Joint Chiefs Chairman Mullen, said that Al Qaida is extending its reach in Somalia and engaging extremists there to revitalize its operations. As I told you, I met with many leading figures in Somalia during a recent December trip to Djibouti. Those meetings reinforced my belief that while Somalis are a moderate people, the situation is now far worse than it was two years ago, and the current administration's approach to Somalia is at least partly to blame. What's your view on -- on what's gone wrong with that and how -- how we can fix it? Give me a little sense of what you think some of the key components are, understanding you haven't had a chance to get into all of this at this point. CLINTON: Senator, as you and I discussed, Somalia is strategically located. I think it was you who asked me if I knew how far Yemen was from Somalia. If it wasn't you, it was some smart person who asked me that. FEINGOLD: I didn't know. I had to ask my staff and -- quite surprised to learn it was 20 miles. CLINTON: Twenty miles. And so the idea that Somalia is just a failed state somewhere over there where people are fighting with one another over heaven knows what is a -- a construct that we adopt at our peril. I -- I don't know the most effective way forward. I have no -- you know, no wisdom on this, Senator. I know you met in Djibouti over a period of a couple of days with a number of the -- the actors. As you know, the Ethiopian troops are leaving. The African Union commitment is questionable as to whether they will or will not stay and what their mission description would be. The internal conflict within the groups in Somalia is just as intense as it's ever been, only now we have the added ingredient of Al Qaida and terrorists who are looking to take advantage of the chaos and the failure of Somalia. There's a lot of history here, and I think we have to be very thoughtful as we look at Somalia. This is obviously a -- an issue that will have to be worked across the national security apparatus. And I would welcome your advice. You probably have as much firsthand knowledge of the players and what they intend and who they are and -- and what they're really looking for as anyone, you know, in this body. And so we're going to -- we're going to seek your advice and counsel. I mean, as the chairman well remembers, at the beginning of the last Democratic administration, there was a humanitarian mission in Somalia that was handed off. And the beginning of this Democratic administration, here we are once again with the remnants of a humanitarian mission, and certainly, the humanitarian crisis growing that is going to put this problem in the lap of the new president. FEINGOLD: Exactly. CLINTON: So I -- I think that this is going to require an enormous amount of thought. Now, complicating it, as you well know, is the piracy issue. FEINGOLD: Right. CLINTON: There's been a number of consultations about piracy. The current thinking is that pirates will be intercepted and defended against as a kind of joint responsibility between the private shippers, who have to do more, frankly, for their own -- the security of their own vessels, but also various navies that are, you know, coming together, including China and India, who are -- are willing to patrol the waters. There is also some talk about going ashore -- this is a problem Thomas Jefferson dealt with along the Barbary Coast, you know, kind of going to prove that the more things change, the more they stay the same. You know, there are some who are advocating going ashore on Somalia. We have to give a lot of thought to this, and there is an enormous number of bad options that have to be sorted through. So I -- I am not at all able to give you the new administration's policy, because we're sorting it out ourselves. FEINGOLD: I can tell you're eager and very ready to take this on. CLINTON: Yes, indeed. FEINGOLD: So I look forward to working with you. Let me switch to something completely different. There's widespread recognition of the need to build a more robust and effective diplomatic and development corps. And as a part of that effort, it, of course, makes sense to consider ways to address challenges faced by the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender employees, particularly relating to domestic partner benefits and State Department policies that make it difficult for the partners of foreign service officers to travel and live at overseas posts. What would you do as secretary of state to address these concerns? Will you support changes to existing personnel policy in order to ensure that LGBT staff at State and USAID receive equal benefits and support? CLINTON: Senator, this issue was brought to my attention during the transition. I've asked to have more briefing on it because I think that we should take a hard look at the existing policy. As I understand it, but don't hold me to it because I don't have the full briefing material, but my understanding is other nations have moved to extend that partnership benefit. And we will come back to you to inform you of decisions we make going forward. FEINGOLD: Thank you, Senator. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. KERRY: Thank you very much. Thanks, Senator. Well, we're sort of getting to that point now where I think we can address some loose ends and maybe even, you know, sort of have some fun and dig into things a little bit here in ways that we can't otherwise. But we promise not to prolong it. And we'll try and remain focused on those things that are really salient here. Let me begin with Afghanistan, if I may. I am deeply concerned that, at least thus far, our policy in Afghanistan has kind of been on automatic. And I made a promise to myself a long time ago that I would not see all of our conflicts, ground operations in the context of Vietnam. I really try hard. I have an automatic check that says, you know, not everything is that. But I have to tell you, in the several visits I have now made, escape it as I might, the parallels just really keep leaping out in so many different ways. We are struggling to fight with and for people with a different culture, a different language, different custom, different history, different religion, if any. And all of those similarities exist. We don't live there. We don't live in the community, in a hamlet, in a small town, pocket, whatever you want to call it. And so we're not there often at night. They are. And the night often rules with insurgencies. The complications are profound in both Pakistan and Afghanistan. And I went to both -- and to India -- immediately after Mumbai and was really struck by the extraordinary distance we have to travel in both places, Senator. That is the center of the war on -- I've got check myself. I hope this administration and all of us will begin to think differently in this terminology of war on terror and think in terms of the global counterinsurgency and the difference between counterinsurgency and counterterrorism and the challenges that we face in addressing both and understanding them both. One person made a very interesting comment to me while I was over there and said, you know, Pakistan is a government without a country, and Afghanistan is a country without a government. And if you stop and think about -- so the real application -- and no insult meant to anybody. President Karzai is a friend. We've all met with him. We want his success. But there are inherent contradictions in the structure that we have been trying to impose in Afghanistan. And more and more, as I travel that part of the world -- I served most recently as chair of the Subcommittee on Mideast, South Asia -- so I was frequently there. It left -- it kept leaping out at me in ways that, over a number of years here, I really, frankly had not given enough consideration to. But recently read a wonderful book when I commend to you by Rory Stewart, you know, "The Places in Between" and another book, "The Forever War" and a whole host of them that really give you the flavor of this if you really want it -- I mean, "Gertrude Bell, the Desert Queen" is a fascinating study of sort of the region and of tribalism. And that's really what I want to point to. We have not, I think -- we honored tribalism when we dealt with the Northern Alliance and initially went in to Afghanistan. We really haven't adequately since. And it strikes me that if we just put troops, plunk them down, another 20, 30,000 in Afghanistan, without very limited view of what they can achieve and need to do and a comprehensive view of other things we need to do to build the successful structures of governance -- the police, the judiciary which may be a pipe dream, the construction programs, the ability of Hamid Karzai's government, as well intentioned as he may be and as much as we like him, the ability to even get out of Kabul and be able to do anything in the countryside, I think -- Madam Secretary Designate, we're on the wrong track. And I think unless we rethink this very, very carefully, we could raise the stakes, invest America's reputation in a greater way as well as our treasure and wind up pursuing a policy that is, frankly, unpursuable, unachievable. So I'd like to elicit your thoughts on this. I was in Pasharah (ph) a few weeks ago. I learned that -- and some in Pakistan would disagree with this, and I'll probably hear from some of my friend there. But many people believe that it would not be hard for the Taliban to move in there if that's the decision they decided to make. It was so dangerous that we were not able to move into the downtown and other areas. And we just saw last week 600 Taliban cross the border from Afghanistan and came in and directly attacked a frontier corps military outpost. I have anybody who has really traveled on the ground, listened in the right ways, and not just accepted the sort of briefing culture will suggest to you respectfully, Madam Secretary, this really has to be rethought very, very carefully. Our original goal was to go in there and take on Al Qaeda. It was to capture or kill Osama bin Laden. It was not to adopt the 51st state of the United States. It was not to try to impose a form of government, no matter how much we believe in it and support it, but that is -- that is the mission, at least, as it is being defined today. So I'd like to ask for your thoughts on this as you engage in what will, obviously, be a hasty and important critical review and some judgments that we need to make about our policy. CLINTON: Well, Mr. Chairman, I think that your cautions are extremely well taken. There is, as you know, a review going on right now under the direction of General Petraeus through CENTCOM. If I understand it, he has approximately 300 people, some of them detailees from the State Department, who are crisscrossing Afghanistan trying to determine, as I understand it, what is and isn't feasible. We are in close communication with General Petraeus. We intend to, when it's appropriate on January 20th, to begin our own immediate review because I share your concern as I know the president-elect does. You know, his approach toward Afghanistan, which is has been more for more -- you know, more troops would go in but there would have to be more from NATO and there would have to be more from Afghanistan -- you know, presupposes that we have a set of discreet goals that we are trying to achieve. And that is in the process of being assessed and analyzed right now. As you're aware, President Bush had inside the White House General Lute, who was largely responsible for coordinating policy with respect to both Iraq and Afghanistan. So the Bush administration has put a lot of assets to work on trying to determine what is the best way forward with Afghanistan and how do we affect the future of Pakistan, the decisions that they make. But I think that asking the hard questions and raising the red flags is exactly what this committee I know will do and should do. Sitting here today, when I think about my trips to Afghanistan, my flying over that terrain, my awareness of the history going back to Alexander the Great and, certainly, the imperial British military and Rudyard Kipling's memorable poems about Afghanistan, the Soviet Union, which put in more troops than we're thinking about putting in -- I mean, it calls for a large doze of humility about what it is we are trying to accomplish. Having said that, I think that we will keep you informed as we move forward. And on the civilian side, I hope that we will have the opportunity for more in-depth conversations. I mean, I've been on both sides now of the table here. And there is so much to discuss, and there is so much expertise on this committee -- people who have traveled widely, thought deeply, know a lot of the players. And I hope that, you know, if I am confirmed, that I'll be able to have you and others literally sitting down and talking with the people that we're going to be tasking to come up with the civilian side of this strategy so that we go in with our eye open, whatever it is we're trying to achieve. KERRY: Well, I really appreciate that. I don't expect you to be able to lay out that strategy now. I would say that I think it's important, perhaps, for the administration -- the incoming administration -- to not just have the review process that's been put in place be the only standard for a baseline. And I think we need to make certain that there's a subsequent expectation with regard to that. I think it would be a mistake to just do that. I think you probably agree with that. Secondly, with respect to the current military operations, I spent a lot of time in a couple of briefings that we're not allowed to discuss in public here. But trying to really get at this question of the targeting with respect to the Pakistan, the Fatah, and our efforts to take out terrorists in that area. There has been a considerable blow-back and, I think, counterproductivity in the collateral damage that has been occurring there. And I hope that you would also agree to really dig into that and take a look at whether or not all of that, the targeting, is in fact as purported to be and as important as is suggested because I think we're creating some terrorists and losing some ground in the effort to win the hearts and minds as they say. CLINTON: Yes, sir. KERRY: On the situation with Pakistan, they not only face the challenge of the insurgency in the country; they have a dire economic crisis also. And in many ways, the economic crisis may be just as challenging. We, after I went over with Senator Biden and Senator Hagel last year, we came back and propped a tripling of the aid to $1.5 billion a year over the course of a number of years. And I wonder, can you say today that the administration is -- remaining absolutely committed to that because we want to try to move that as rapidly as we can? CLINTON: Yes. The president-elect does support the regulation that you were part of and Vice President-elect Biden and, I think, Senator Lugar was as well. KERRY: Correct. CLINTON: And we want it try to begin, to some extent, to separate our military aid from our non-military aid. The tripling of the non-military aid is intended to provide resources that will both support the Pakistani people but also give some tools to the democratically-elected government to try to start producing results for the people of Pakistan. The military aid, we want to, you know, really look hard at seeing whether we can condition some of that on the commitment for the counterinsurgency, counterterrorism missions. So we certainly are inclined to support, when appropriate, the legislation that you were referring to. KERRY: And this is going to take a very significant hands-on effort, as I think you know. We've been, obviously, reading about or hearing about the potential of special envoys, as series of them. Do you want to address that at all today? CLINTON: Well, no final decisions have been made. That is a tool that I think you will see more use of. I believe that special envoys, particularly, vis a vis military commands, have a lot to recommend in order to make sure that we've got the civilian presence well represented. CLINTON: I believe that special envoys, particularly, vis a vis military commands, have a lot to recommend in order to make sure that we've got the civilian presence well represented and in other areas that are hotspots that will demand so much time that we need to put someone, well experienced, an expert, to work on it. So we are working through that and, again, this is an area that we will be coming back to you with. KERRY: I just noticed Senator Vitter is back. I don't want to -- I've gone over my time a little bit, because we were sort of in a wrap-up. Did you -- OK, fine. I was stunned in India, Pakistan and Afghanistan to learn that our principal diplomats in that region do not get together to compare notes. I was also shocked to learn that our INTEL (NASDAQ:INTC) folks likewise don't do the same. That is just, to me, absolutely mind-boggling. CLINTON: Right. Well, Mr. Chairman, these are among the challenges that we intend to take on. Trying to create more of a regional perspective and a functional approach instead of being caught in the boxes that people unfortunately too often feel imprisoned by, so that there are certain lines preventing you from actually communicating with your fellow American diplomat across that line or INTEL or whatever. I don't have the experience that you have over the years on this committee and even before, but in my travels, I did see the results of that kind of compartmentalization, and we're going to try to break that down. We're going to try to use the bureaus more effectively so that they can be encouraging that. I've been reading up on George Marshall, who made it clear he didn't ever want a memo longer than two pages, and others who have advised me to begin to break down the kind of paper culture that exists and to try to get people more focused on action items, and one of those is more communication back and forth among those who are American representatives in regions of interest and concern to us. KERRY: Well, I'm delighted to hear you say that and I think that doing it through the bureaus is precisely an easy way to do and that way you'll know ultimately what is happening, I think. Senator Isakson raised a question about the Hamas political strategy and compared it to Africa, and I just -- I want to flag something for you, because the history of the last years in the Middle East and what's going on in Gaza today and the divisions between Hamas and FATA, the division in the West Bank, in my judgment, reflects, again, a stunning consequence as a lack of engagement and a lack of thinking about sort of common sense of how things work. I had the privilege of being in the West Bank the day -- the morning after President Abbas was elected in 2005 and I met with him in Ramallah in that old headquarters and we spent some time together and he looked at me and he said, "You know, Senator, I know exactly what you expect of me. I have to disarm Hamas. Now, you tell me how I'm supposed to do that. I have no radios, I have no cars, I have no police, and Hamas has the ability to walk up to a door and deliver $20,000 value to somebody who's blown up, widows or orphans of a family of a suicide bomber." They deliver the services and we, for years, have talked about the creation of a legitimate partner for peace and yet we've done almost nothing to fundamentally help them deliver that capacity. So my hope is -- I mean, I fear -- I mean, Israel has all the right in the world and we are totally supportive of the patience they've shown, the forbearance, over 10,500 rockets, the fact that Hamas broke the ceasefire. We understand the need to deal with Hamas, but we also have to recognize the threat here that Hamas may, in fact, wind up being more powerful than FATA as a consequence. And the question is: has this further set back the ability to create that legitimate partner for peace? Would you comment perhaps on -- you did a little bit in your opening, but I think it would be worthwhile getting a better sense of how you see the play there and the end game, if you will, with respect to Hamas. CLINTON: Well, you know, we are at a point where the current administration is working very hard behind the scenes and in front of the scenes and we don't want to say or do anything that might interrupt or undermine what they are doing. I think your point, though, is incredibly important and that's why earlier I mentioned the work that General Jones had done, in which he was part of a bottoms-up approach, working with Abbas, Fayed and others in the West Bank, and there were results. That's what's so tragic is that more effort earlier, more sustained, more targeted, it got to the point where the Israeli defense force was willing to turn over security to members of the Palestinian force that had been under the training of this team that General Jones put together. KERRY: General Dayton and... CLINTON: Yes. General Dayton was on the ground. There is so much more we have to do and, obviously, we do support Israel's right to defend itself and we do understand and appreciate what it must be like to be subjected to rocket attacks. And Hamas did break the ceasefire and they have no intention, at least so far as we can tell, of entering into another ceasefire at this moment and the rockets are still being launched. So I think that working toward a durable ceasefire is going to be an initial challenge if it's not achieved by the time that the president-elect takes office. But that's not the answer. The answer is how do we begin to rebuild some sense of cooperation and, dare I say, even trust and confidence-building measures so we can get back to this work of the slow, but steady building of the capacity of the Palestinian Authority. So I know that General Jones is very committed to that. I share that commitment and we intend to look into that as soon as we are able. KERRY: Well, I know that's going to be a high priority. I know you've already been meeting on it and I don't think we need to belabor it here now. But we wish you well with that and, obviously, want to try to be as helpful as we can. Just two quick last issues. Are there any other questions? I'm going to sort of wrap. One thing I do want to ask, if I may, and I don't want to belabor it, but it's coming at us enormously and that is the question of what we're really going to be able to do here with respect to global climate change. I was in (INAUDIBLE) in a meeting and I met with all of the delegations that I had met with in Kyoto and Rio in various years and it is stunning to see the transformation on those meetings, particularly with the Chinese and with the low islands, the small islands representatives and with the Indonesians and others, with Brazilians with respect to forests and so forth. They are scared. They are serious. And what struck me is the degree to which everybody is waiting for us to take a lead. Now, I say that in one particular context. Recently, a group of our top scientists have run computer models and it shows that we are well ahead in terms of the effects of global climate change of all of the IPC studies today. Every single study shows that today our rate of increase of emissions is way beyond what is supportable. In the last ten years, we are increasing emissions, not decreasing them, four times as fast as we were in the 1990s. More chilling is the computer modeling they did against the current plans of every single country that is planning to do anything, and it's not that big a group. The European community has a 2020 date of reductions. The Chinese have a reduction of intensity, not a specific reduction of emissions. The other countries individually have either set a loose 2020 goal. Some, like us, have set a 2050 goal, but 80 percent reduction under the Obama plan, but not yet implemented, not yet real. They took all of these current projections and ran the computer models against what is currently happening in the science and in every single case, it showed that we are not just marginally above a catastrophic tipping point level. We are hugely significantly above it. Scientists have now revised the levels of supportable greenhouse gas emissions from 550 parts per million to 450 to now 350. This had emissions at over 600. This had a temperature increase of in the range of three to five, six degrees if we do business as usual over the next few years. The results, and I'm not going to go through them all now, but the results are on every single level of sea ice species, forest migration, drought, storms, disease, refugees, I mean, you start adding it up. The consequences in terms of national security, human condition on this planet, are simply catastrophic. They're devastating. So our challenge is going to be even greater than it was five months ago, Senator, or two months ago. The perception that we can kind of creep at this and perhaps do something this year, notwithstanding our economy, is foolhardy. And so I hope -- I just flag it for you. I know that the president-elect has said he's going to focus on it. But I'm not sure that everybody coming into the administration is completely aware of what a big lift this is going to be and how imperative it is that we make Copenhagen a success. I simply want to ask your undivided focus and leadership on this issue, because it is that critical. CLINTON: Well, Mr. Chairman, you will have it, because I share your deep concern. You were eloquent in describing it and you've been a leader in trying to sound the alarm on it for many years. As I've said, we will have a climate change envoy negotiator, because we want to elevate it and we want to have one person who will lead our international efforts. But I agree completely that our credibility leading internationally will depend, in large measure, on what we're able to accomplish here at home. And as we heard the president-elect earlier at lunch, he will be putting forth a stimulus package that will have some energy, renewable energy provisions. So I think that's a good start and we have a lot of work to do. KERRY: Senator Menendez, did you have any additional questions? You did. MENENDEZ: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I was listening to some of the previous questions and I just want to make sure, since I made a statement earlier today, that I'm right and if I'm not, I'm happy to correct it for the record. It is my understanding that participants and contributors to the Clinton Global Initiative have been publicly disclosed since its inception and that that will continue to be disclosed. Is that a factual statement or am I wrong? CLINTON: That is correct, Senator. MENENDEZ: And those contributors have been listed in all types from press releases to event materials to a whole host of other ways in which the public has clearly been informed. Is that correct? CLINTON: That is correct. MENENDEZ: Now, it's my understanding, too, when I looked at this, which is why I didn't dwell upon it in my first round of questioning, that the determination has been made that there is no conflict of interest, but notwithstanding that, that you and President Clinton have been willing to go above and beyond in voluntary actions, as it relates to both law and ethics, to make sure that there is no question. Is that a statement of fact? CLINTON: That is also correct. MENENDEZ: Well, Mr. Chairman, what I would hate to see is some who would put in doubt what I think is an incredibly important opportunity here and that is to have two extraordinary public servants be able to meet the challenges our country has in this world. The Clinton Initiative has made a difference for people, millions of people in this world. One point four million people, Mr. Chairman, now are living a safer life, and living lives longer, and having their lives saved as a result of the HIV/AIDS efforts that that initiative created. The cost of medicine to treat children with HIV/AIDS has dropped by 89 percent over the last two years. Forty of the world's largest cities are working with the Clinton Initiative to eliminate and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, something that the chairman is such a powerful advocate of. Nearly 3,000 schools are promoting healthier educational environments. I would hate for what Nelson Mandela has said is a global movement where every word spoken, where every partnership discovered, where every promise made can have a direct impact on the lives of millions of people across our planet for generations to come, something that -- the president-elect, Barack Obama, has said that these initiatives help create a model for individual responsibility and collective action to the Clinton Global Initiative, bringing people together to take on tough global challenges. In four years, you have made concrete commitments that have affected over 200 million people in 150 countries. I would hate for that incredible record and opportunity not just of what was done in the past, moving forward, to be blemished by some simply for purposes that are far less substantive and, in my view, a lot more political. But I think it's incredibly important. I know that there are legitimate questions, and I think that those questions have been very well answered. But I can't sit in my office watching what is going on and feel with myself, knowing what this initiative has done for millions of people in this country on things that I critically care about and so many members of this committee have, and let it go at that. So I appreciate your willingness to go above and beyond what is both the law and the ethics. I am sure you will continue to do so. I have expectations as one member of this committee that you will do so. And I certainly hope that President Clinton's work, while obviously conditioned by the agreements that you have all set out, can still be able to move forward in a way that those people will be able throughout the world to know that America is great because it is good. And one of its goodnesses is, in fact, what we do through initiatives like President Clinton, like President Carter, and others as well. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. KERRY: Thank you very much, Senator Menendez. Let me just say -- I wasn't going to -- I wasn't planning to comment on it, but in light of your comment, I'll just close out pointing out Senator Lugar and I and -- and all of us who have looked at this could not have more respect for CGI, the Clinton Global Initiative, and what it does and has accomplished. And I couldn't agree with you more with respect to the distinction between that and the questions asked by the senator from Wyoming. That initiative, I think we adequately set forward here, is not at issue, because there will not be fundraising. There will be no foreign donors. And it really doesn't properly fit under the questions asked by Senator Lugar. In fairness to Senator Lugar and to the thinking of the committee -- and I think Senator Clinton understands this full well and I'm confident from her answers that she's articulated a sensitivity to this which is going to have to be judged by the practice, and we're going to have to go forward and see. But there is a legitimate question, and I think, Senator, you'd agree that it's hard to distinguish between a donation currently made and -- and -- and acknowledged publicly and a donation to be made in the future, a commitment made thereto, but not acknowledged publicly. And so the effort here is not to cast any aspersion on anybody, or to suggest any lack of integrity or anything like that. It is simply to deal with the complicated legal concept of an appearance of a conflict of interest. If you are traveling to some country and you meet with the foreign leadership, and a week later or two weeks later or three weeks later the president travels there and solicits a donation, and they pledge to give at some point in the future, but nobody knows, is there an appearance of a conflict? Could there be an appearance of a conflict? That is what I think Senator Lugar is trying to get at. He has determined that it is simpler simply to adopt one of the options that he's articulated. For reasons you obviously feel are important, and we understand it, you feel otherwise. You have gone beyond the law. You have done things to set up a process. And really, we're going to have to make the process work, and we're confident that you have put yourself on the line today to make that happen. So that's really where we are. MENENDEZ: Mr. Chairman, if I may... KERRY: Yes. MENENDEZ: ... just very briefly, my concerns, since you couched it in the context of Senator Lugar's questions, is not so much what Senator Lugar posed. I think he did it as he always does, in a very balanced way. My concern is other questions that were raised by other members here. KERRY: That's what I was referring to. MENENDEZ: Oh. KERRY: Oh, no, no, no, I'm referring to that, but I'm simply -- as chair, I want to share in the perceptions, as I have from the beginning, that -- that those are things that we make judgments about, and we honor that and respect that. So let me say that I think this has been a -- a very positive and constructive hearing. I think you have acquitted yourself with great distinction today. I think people are impressed by the versatility and the breadth that you have shown both in the preparation as well as in your own knowledge. We really do anticipate trying to move this as rapidly as we can. And much more importantly, Senator Clinton, we really -- you know, this is an unbelievably important moment for our country, for the world, that waiting for this leadership. President-elect Obama, you, the administration -- all of us -- are staring at a magnificent opportunity to be able to make America what we believe it can be and should be, and to bring it back, in a sense, in terms of these global efforts. And we are excited about the prospect of working with you to make that happen. So thank you for your time today, and good luck to you. We look forward to working with you in the days ahead. CLINTON: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Senator Lugar. LUGAR: Thank you. KERRY: We stand adjourned. (APPLAUSE) We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think."
"Obama Warns U.S. Faces Diffuse Terrorism Threats","Advertisement Supported by By  Mark Landler WEST POINT, N.Y. — President Obama tried once more to articulate his vision of the American role in the world on Wednesday, telling graduating cadets here that the nation they were being called to serve would seek to avoid military misadventures abroad, even as it confronts a new set of terrorist threats from the Middle East to Africa. Speaking at the commencement of the United States Military Academy, Mr. Obama disputed critics who say his cautious response to crises like Syria’s civil war and Russian aggression toward Ukraine had eroded America’s leadership in the world. Those critics, he said , were “either misreading history or engaged in partisan politics.” But for a president who has promised to take the United States off a permanent war footing, Mr. Obama painted an unsettling portrait of the world, 13 years after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The nation, he said, had, in effect, traded Al Qaeda in Afghanistan for a more diffuse threat from extremists in Syria, Nigeria, Somalia, Yemen, Mali and other countries. A day after announcing that the last American soldier would leave Afghanistan at the end of 2016 , Mr. Obama told a new class of Army officers that some of them would be sent on murkier missions, helping endangered nations deal with their own terrorist groups. In the only new policy announcement of the speech, he called on Congress to finance what he called a Counterterrorism Partnerships Fund, with up to $5 billion to provide training in these operations to vulnerable countries like Iraq, Lebanon and Turkey, all neighbors of Syria. “We have to develop a strategy that matches this diffuse threat; one that expands our reach without sending forces that stretch our military too thin, or stirs up local resentments,” Mr. Obama declared. “We need partners to fight terrorists alongside us.” The president has spoken before about the threat from terrorism, most notably in a speech last May at the National Defense University . But on those occasions he had taken pains to note that the threat was on a lesser scale than the Sept. 11 attacks and could be dealt with “smartly and proportionately.” On Wednesday, his language was more ominous: “For the foreseeable future,” he said, “the most direct threat to America at home and abroad remains terrorism.” Mr. Obama singled out Syria, which he said was becoming a haven for extremists,  a situation that his critics have attributed in part to his own unwillingness to take more aggressive action. While pledging to strengthen American support for the opposition — something he has done several times before — the president did not discuss expanding the C.I.A.’s covert training program for Syrian rebels in Jordan, perhaps bringing in the military, an option that is being discussed inside the administration. A senior administration official said after the speech that the White House was consulting with Congress about ways to expand the military’s role in counterterrorism operations. But he declined to say whether the administration had decided on a bigger Pentagon role in Syria and noted there were other ways to help the opposition. Little in Mr. Obama’s tone suggested he had dropped his reluctance to get involved militarily in Syria, a position that has not changed despite three years of war and a death toll above 160,000. “I made a decision that we should not put American troops into the middle of this increasingly sectarian war, and I believe that is the right decision,” Mr. Obama said. “But that does not mean we shouldn’t help the Syrian people stand up against a dictator who bombs and starves his own people.” Weeks in the drafting, the president’s speech was meant to be a wide-ranging rebuttal to critics who say he should have done more to curb the bloodshed in Syria or stop Russia’s takeover of Crimea. But it also rejected arguments that the United States should retreat from its post-World War II centrality in global affairs. Mr. Obama instead called for a middle course between isolationism and overreach, citing the international coalition the United States had mobilized to counter Russia’s aggression in Ukraine as an example of how to use American muscle “without firing a shot.” “America must always lead on the world stage,” the president said. “But U.S. military action cannot be the only — or even primary — component of our leadership in every instance. Just because we have the best hammer does not mean that every problem is a nail.” West Point , with its 1,064 graduating cadets in full dress uniform, offered a grand backdrop for Mr. Obama’s foreign policy blueprint. But he got a subdued reception under leaden skies and chilly wind, which left family members of the cadets, many in shirt sleeves and sundresses, shivering in the stands of the football stadium. One line that did bring a burst of applause, mainly from parents, came when Mr. Obama told the graduates they might be the first class since 2001 not sent to serve in Iraq or Afghanistan. It was a very different theme than in 2009, when he came here to announce the United States would send 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan. Mr. Obama presented Afghanistan as a mission all but fulfilled and described a world of threats that require a more targeted and varied American response. He also repeated a call for the United States to be more transparent about its counterterrorism operations — something on which it has made scant progress since last year. “When we cannot explain our efforts clearly and publicly, we face terrorist propaganda and international suspicion,” Mr. Obama said. “We erode legitimacy with our partners and our people; and we reduce accountability in our own government.” The president once again pledged to be more open about America’s secret wars, saying that drone strikes “like those we’ve carried out in Yemen and Somalia” need to be explained publicly to counter militant propaganda. He did not mention Pakistan, which for a decade has been the epicenter of America’s drone wars, but where the United States government still considers the strikes, carried out by the C.I.A., a covert action. But he reiterated a vow to transfer the drone strikes and other counterterrorism operations from the C.I.A. to the Pentagon, a pledge he made a year ago, but which has been unfulfilled because of turf fights and congressional resistance. Mr. Obama has been deeply frustrated by the criticism of his foreign policy, which during his first term was generally perceived as his strong suit. He has lashed out at critics, whom he accuses of reflexively calling for military action as the remedy for every crisis. On a trip to Asia last month, Mr. Obama described his foreign policy credo with a baseball analogy: “You hit singles, you hit doubles; every once in a while we may be able to hit a home run.” But, he added, the overriding objective is to avoid an error on the scale of the Iraq war. In private conversations, the president has used a saltier variation of the phrase, “don’t do stupid stuff” — brushing aside as reckless those who say the United States should consider enforcing a no-fly zone in Syria or supplying arms to Ukrainian troops. At West Point, a 212-year-old institution on a bluff overlooking the Hudson River, Mr. Obama struck a loftier tone, quoting Dwight D. Eisenhower on the folly of war and John F. Kennedy on the need for peace based on “a gradual evolution in human institutions.” Mr. Obama said the Iran nuclear negotiations and a new climate-change accord would be among his top foreign policy priorities for his final two and a half years in office, noting tartly that a deal on climate change would be a stretch “if a whole lot of our political leaders deny that it is taking place.” To make his case for the United States as the ultimate guarantor of an international order, the president drew on the example of Russia and Ukraine. Far from conceding the episode was a setback, he said American leadership in putting together an international coalition and imposing sanctions had thrown President Vladimir V. Putin on the defensive. “This mobilization of world opinion and institutions served as a counterweight to Russian propaganda, Russian troops on the border and armed militias in ski masks,” Mr. Obama said.

"A Conversation With: Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar","Pollsters and analysts have been talking about the increasing chances of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (B.J.P.) emerging as the single largest party in Indiaâs 2014 national elections, but falling short of the total number of parliamentary seats needed to form a government. Are you a potential prime minister candidate for the B.J.P. if enough coalition partners do not back your current leader, Mr. Narendra Modi, after the 2014 general elections? Polls suggest the B.J.P. will need allies, and may have to sacrifice Mr. Modi after the elections. No, not at all, I am not a candidate. And I don’t think the current opinion polls are accurate. It’s too early for the polls â voter behavior has not polarized yet, the campaign has not started. But there is a 5 to 6 percent vote swing in favor of the B.J.P. and if you map our party’s demographic, then we have the possibility of winning in 330 to 340 seats [above the 272 majority mark, and enough to ensure Mr. Modi as prime minister]. Is the B.J.P. placing all bets on this unprecedented sweep, though your best performance toÂ date is 183 seats, in 1999? Does your party not have a Plan B? The Plan B, if there is one, need not be discussed when we are trying our best to win with our Plan A. A smart operator always has an exit policy, but that exit policy is not discussed in advance, never. It has to be an inside affair of the party. But by projecting Mr. Modi as your leader, are you not turning off many voters who do not identify with a right-wing hardliner? Today the scenario in the country is a [Congress party-led] regime that is not delivering, a regime where the prime minister [Manmohan Singh] is seen as a lame duck. The government has to be pragmatic and get things done, but this government is incapable of doing it, it’s in a perpetual state of suspension. In these circumstances, particularly young people see an alternative model in Modi, and if they want him as prime minister they will have to elect his local representative. Also, a substantial number of businessmen are likely to back the B.J.P. this time, and they will also go for Modi. I believe a national mood is forming to put the B.J.P. in power and Modi as prime minister. You have said the 2002 Gujarat riots under Mr. Modi wereÂ an administrative failure. Should he apologize for this lapse that resulted in so many deaths, as his critics suggest? Administrative failure does not mean everything is blamed on one man, Narendra Modi. What happened then was unfortunate, but that does not require his apology, it requires his correction and he has done that. There were many reasons why people lost control in 2002 after the dead bodies [of Hindu pilgrims from an earlier attack] were shown on TV. It should not have happened, the administration should have clamped down on any violence, [If I were in his place] I would have ensured…but Modi was new to the job as chief minister. It was a blot on Modi’s career, but he was not personally a part of it. If he is guilty by connivance he should be punished, but investigations have given him a clean chit. People who oppose him do so because they fear him. You are seen as the moderate face of the Hindu right, but where do you see yourself ideologically? Are you a Hindu nationalist? I am a 100 percent democrat, democracy is at my heart. I am a perfect Hindu, but that is my personal faith, it has nothing to do with government. India is a Hindu nation in the cultural sense [Hindus are 82 percent of the population]. A Catholic in Goa is also Hindu culturally, because his practices don’t match with Catholics in Brazil [a former Portuguese outpost like Goa]; except in the religious aspect, a Goan Catholic’s way of thinking and practice matches a Hinduâs. So Hindu for me is not a religious term, it is cultural. I am not the Hindu nationalist as understood by some TV media â not one who will take out a sword and kill a Muslim. According to me that is not Hindu behavior at all. Hindus don’t attack anyone, they only do so for self-defense — that is our history. But in the right sense of the term, I am a Hindu nationalist. Turning to Goa’s economy, about a quarter of the state’s population is dependent on mining, which was banned by the Supreme Court last year to stop illegal extraction. Have you been able to clean up the system? I have started. We are recovering some money that was not paid, and we are filing court cases against the guilty. But the blanket mining ban is hurting us â the court may be right in its perspective, but why can’t it find a solution for so long? Judges like to say justice delayed is justice denied: and here I am with 25 percent of my revenues gone, 25 percent of my people almost on the roads, and the court is not hearing me. There is nothing more criminal than that. With mining revenues gone, you will be hoping that tourism can cover the shortfall this year. But safety for women is now a big concern for tourists to India. I don’t think we have that problem in Goa. Rapes happen elsewhere too, but there has to be quick reaction. In the 17 months of my regime, there is not a single instance where the police has failed to register a case in these matters, against an Indian or foreigner. There has been only one case of rape against a foreigner in my tenure, and we caught the culprit in three hours. Indiaâs national elections began April 7 and will continue on nine separate dates until May 12, with results expected to be announced on May 16. The vote is the worldâs largest, with 814 million eligible voters set to choose 543 members of the lower house of Parliament. The other two seats will be appointed by the president. This election is widely considered to be Indiaâs most consequential since 1977. India Ink will be moving to the World page of The New York Times.

"Rice Presses for Pullout as Georgia Signs Cease-Fire","Advertisement By ELLEN BARRY and GRAHAM BOWLEY AUG. 15, 2008  With Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice standing by, the Georgian president signed a cease-fire agreement with Russia on Friday. Ms. Rice then declared that all Russian troops must leave Georgian territory immediately. Ms. Rice, who was in Tbilisi to show support for President Mikheil Saakashvili , said that “with this signature” there had to be “the immediate and orderly withdrawal of Russian armed forces and the return of those forces to Russia.” At the same time, a column of at least a dozen armored vehicles moved south from Gori, the central Georgian city, to the village of Igoeti, and took up a position there, about 15 miles from Tbilisi, the Georgian capital. This company-sized unit of armored personnel carriers, commanded by a Russian captain, has come closer to the capital than any other so far. Russia put its signature to the accord earlier this week, but the agreement included a point that allowed Russian troops to act in what was termed a peacekeeping role, even outside the boundaries of the separatist enclaves where the war began. Advertisement It soon became clear that Russian forces had turned this provision to their advantage as Russian troops, pushed further into Georgia and seized full control of the central city of Gori in recent days. Advertisement Ms. Rice addressed these concerns, and called for the speedy deployment of an international peacekeeping force for the two separatist enclaves, which would make any further Russian presence unnecessary. She said Russian and Georgian troops must now pull back to the positions they occupied before hostilities began over a week ago. Only Russian troops performing a true peacekeeping role should remain in the two enclaves, she said. Standing beside Mr. Saakashvili in Tbilisi, Ms. Rice said: “This must take place and take place now.” Tensions between Washington and Moscow have risen sharply in the past 24 hours, as Russia’s president and foreign minister made it clear that they would support separatist efforts by two breakaway Georgian territories and as the specter of a resurgent Russia helped persuade Poland to agree to a long-stalled deal on an American missile defense system. In a news conference in Tbilisi that was dominated by Mr. Saakashvili, who bitterly criticized Russia, Ms. Rice warned of “consequences” for Russia over its military offensive in Georgia. Earlier, in Washington, President Bush condemned as unacceptable what he called Russia’s “bullying and intimidation.” He also said Friday that Russia must withdraw its troops from all of Georgian territory and said the United States would stand with Georgia in the conflict. “Georgia’s sovereignty and territorial integrity must be respected,” he said. However, neither Ms. Rice’s remarks nor those by Mr. Bush contained any hint of any further American response should Russia fail to pull back its troops. As Ms. Rice and Mr. Bush spoke, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany met with the Russian president, Dmitri A. Medvedev, in the Black Sea resort town of Sochi. Ms. Merkel said Russia had taken military action in Georgia that was “not proportionate.” At a joint news conference with Mr. Medvedev, Ms. Merkel urged Russia to withdraw its troops from Georgia, though she added that “both sides are probably to blame” for the conflict. She left open the possibility that Georgia could still join NATO, though analysts have suggested that the likelihood of the country’s accession is now very slim. Advertisement For his part, Mr. Medvedev continued to press the Kremlin’s position that there was no way that Georgia could ever again claim sovereignty over South Ossetia and Abkhazia. “Peace needs to be restored and guaranteed in the region, so that no one gets any more idiotic ideas into their heads,” he said. “This is Russia’s main goal today.” Praising the small nation as a “courageous democracy” that has provided troops to support the American-led wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Mr. Bush said, “The people of Georgia have cast their lot with the free world, and we will not cast them aside.” In some of his strongest language yet on the war that flared up a week ago, Mr. Bush said in a brief statement at the White House, “Moscow must honor its commitment to withdraw its invading forces from all Georgian territory.” Mr. Bush said that the cold war was over and that Russia had damaged its credibility and standing in the international order. Russia now has to “put itself back on the path of responsible nations,” Mr. Bush said. On Friday Russia’s military offensive into Georgia has forced the start of a wholesale reassessment of American dealings with Russia, according to senior Bush administration officials, and jeopardized talks on everything from halting Iran’s nuclear ambitions to reducing strategic arsenals to cooperation on missile defenses. The conflict punctuated a stark turnabout in the administration’s view of Vladimir V. Putin, the president-turned-prime minister whom Mr. Bush has repeatedly described as a trustworthy friend. Now Mr. Bush’s aides complain that Russian officials have been misleading or at least evasive about Russia’s intentions in Georgia. “Russia’s behavior over the past week has called into question the entire premise of that dialogue and has profound implications for our security relationship going forward, both bilaterally and with NATO,” Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Thursday at the Pentagon. “If Russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in Georgia, the U.S.-Russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come.” Advertisement The unspoken new danger is that a cooling relationship could cost the administration any hope of working closely with Russia on some of its topmost priorities, like controlling nuclear proliferation, countering terrorism or resolving the problems of the Middle East. If Russia and the United States rarely have acted as allies during Mr. Bush’s presidency, they also have rarely allowed disagreements to undermine what Mr. Bush considered one of his bedrock diplomatic relationships. After their first meeting in 2001, Mr. Bush said famously that he had looked into Mr. Putin’s eyes and “got a sense of his soul.” Mr. Bush has pursued policies that Mr. Putin vigorously opposed, including supporting the independence of Kosovo from Serbia, a Russian ally, expanding NATO to include some former Soviet bloc nations and stationing elements of a missile defense system in Eastern Europe. But the two worked closely together to battle terrorism. Administration officials said Mr. Putin had generally cooperated in efforts to curtail nuclear programs in Iran and North Korea.

Only four months ago, Mr. Bush and Mr. Putin met in Sochi, Russia, and signed a “framework agreement” that pledged cooperation on a variety of diplomatic and security matters and declared that “the era in which the United States and Russia considered one another an enemy or strategic threat has ended.” Mr. Gates, along with Ms. Rice, has gone to Moscow twice in the past year for discussions on that agreement, which has now been overshadowed by the war and appears unlikely to progress any time soon, if ever. Mr. Bush has not directly addressed his relationship with Mr. Putin or his successor, Mr. Medvedev, and Mr. Bush’s aides declined Thursday to discuss his personal views. But he has bluntly warned Russia that it risks losing its international standing. Mr. Bush went Thursday to the headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency in Langley, Va., for a briefing on the situation in Georgia. “Got a lot of folks, smart folks, analyzing the situation on the ground and, of course, briefing us on different possibilities that could develop in the area and the region,” he said, flanked by the agency’s director, Michael V. Hayden, and his deputy, Stephen R. Kappes. Mr. Bush reiterated his call “for the territorial integrity of Georgia to be respected and the cease-fire agreement to be honored.” Advertisement Both Georgia and Russia took steps back from open conflict on Thursday, with Russia largely ending air operations over Georgia and preparing to withdraw at least some of the troops it had moved inside the country, Mr. Gates said. But the issue of Georgia’s territorial integrity appeared increasingly uncertain after Mr. Medvedev met with the leaders of the two separatist regions, South Ossetia and Abkhazia. His foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, declared that Georgia “can forget about” reclaiming sovereignty over the regions. Mr. Bush rescheduled a trip to his ranch in Texas for Friday, a one-day postponement. Ms. Rice, he said, will brief him after returning from her trip to France and Georgia, which is intended to show American support for Mr. Saakashvili. For a second day, an American C-17 cargo plane arrived in Georgia bearing relief supplies, encountering no interference from Russian forces. Mr. Bush ordered the military-run operation on Wednesday, setting up what administration officials described as a direct challenge to Russia to keep its promise to allow humanitarian aid. A small team of Pentagon officials arrived to assess how best to distribute relief supplies to those wounded or displaced by the conflict. Mr. Gates and Gen. James E. Cartwright, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at a Pentagon briefing that American forces had the right to self-defense but that he did not anticipate having to resort to force to distribute the medicine and shelters. Mr. Gates stressed that he was not predicting a return to the cold war, and he said that over all the United States’ response to the crisis had been restrained. “The United States spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with Russia,” he said. “I see no reason to change that approach today.” Mr. Gates is one of the administration’s experts on Soviet and Russian policies and previously served as the director of central intelligence while spending his career studying the Kremlin and its efforts to exert influence around the world. Advertisement “What happens in the days and months to come will determine the future course of U.S.-Russian relations,” he said. “But by the same token, my personal view is that there needs to be some consequences for the actions that Russia has taken against a sovereign state.” The United States has already canceled outright or withdrawn from several military exercises that were to have included Russian forces in the coming days, the first concrete, punitive steps taken by the administration. In addition, Mr. Gates said, the Defense Department “will re-examine the entire gamut of our military-to-military activities with Russia and will make changes as necessary and appropriate, depending on Russian actions in the days ahead.” The Russian government unleashed its military into Georgia to accomplish two goals, Mr. Gates said: to punish Georgia for trying to integrate with the West and to warn other nations in the former Soviet sphere of influence against closer ties with Washington and its NATO allies. “My view is that the Russians — and I would say principally Prime Minister Putin — is interested in reasserting Russia’s, not only Russia’s great power or superpower status, but in reasserting Russia’s traditional spheres of influence,” he said. “My guess is that everyone is going to be looking at Russia through a different set of lenses as we look ahead.” Mr. Gates’s remarks, while critical of Mr. Putin, also included an implicit rebuke of any effort to base American policy solely on a perceived friendship within the Kremlin. At the Pentagon, Mr. Gates was asked whether he trusted Mr. Putin anymore, and he paused before responding. “ ‘Anymore’ is an interesting add,” he said. “I have never believed that one should make national security policy on the basis of trust. I think you make national security policy based on interests and on realities.” Ellen Barry reported from Moscow and Graham Bowley from New York. C.J.

"Domo Arigato, Mr. Roboto — I Mean, Mr. Smith","Noah Smith says I’m Voltron the Invincible . Pardon me while I blush. But he says that my track record doesn’t come from knowing IS-LM , it comes from knowing about Japan. I think he has a point, but it’s not quite right. First of all, many of the evil robots economic commentators I’ve sparred with clearly don’t understand IS-LM at all; in particular, they don’t understand that the effects of monetary expansion and budget deficits are different at the zero lower bound. Japan figures in this difference only to the extent that the Japanese experience demonstrated that the liquidity trap is real (pdf). Now, it’s true that my predictions have generally rested on the proposition not just that we were at the ZLB, but that we were likely to stay there for a long time. That doesn’t come out of the model. Where does it come from? Partly, indeed, from the Japanese experience; you had to be pretty dense not to see how much 2008 looked like the beginning of the lost decade. But it also came from looking at the US experience, and noticing that recessions had changed character . Still,Smith is right that there’s a big divide between people who paid attention to Japan in the 1990s and those who didn’t. Paul Krugman is an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times. Advertisement"
"Who rules the world? America is no longer the obvious answer","Challenged from all sides, the US is losing its tight grip on international power, Noam Chomsky writes, as world public opinion becomes a ‘second superpower’  Noam Chomsky for TomDispatch  Mon 9 May 2016 15.49 BST   Last modified on Fri 14 Jul 2017 17.17 BST   W hen we ask “who rules the world?” we commonly adopt the standard convention that the actors in world affairs are states, primarily the great powers, and we consider their decisions and the relations among them. That is not wrong. But we would do well to keep in mind that this level of abstraction can also be highly misleading. States, of course, have complex internal structures, and the choices and decisions of the political leadership are heavily influenced by internal concentrations of power, while the general population is often marginalized. That is true even for the more democratic societies, and obviously for others. We cannot gain a realistic understanding of who rules the world while ignoring the “masters of mankind”, as Adam Smith called them: in his day, the merchants and manufacturers of England; in ours, multinational conglomerates, huge financial institutions, retail empires and the like. Still following Smith, it is also wise to attend to the “vile maxim” to which the “masters of mankind” are dedicated: “All for ourselves and nothing for other people” – a doctrine known otherwise as bitter and incessant class war, often one-sided, much to the detriment of the people of the home country and the world. In the contemporary global order, the institutions of the masters hold enormous power, not only in the international arena but also within their home states, on which they rely to protect their power and to provide economic support by a wide variety of means. When we consider the role of the masters of mankind, we turn to such state policy priorities of the moment as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, one of the investor-rights agreements mislabeled “free-trade agreements” in propaganda and commentary. They are negotiated in secret, apart from the hundreds of corporate lawyers and lobbyists writing the crucial details. The intention is to have them adopted in good Stalinist style with “fast track” procedures designed to block discussion and allow only the choice of yes or no (hence yes). The designers regularly do quite well, not surprisingly. People are incidental, with the consequences one might anticipate. The neoliberal programs of the past generation have concentrated wealth and power in far fewer hands while undermining functioning democracy, but they have aroused opposition as well, most prominently in Latin America but also in the centers of global power. The European Union (EU), one of the more promising developments of the post-world war II period, has been tottering because of the harsh effect of the policies of austerity during recession, condemned even by the economists of the International Monetary Fund (if not the IMF’s political actors). Democracy has been undermined as decision-making shifted to the Brussels bureaucracy, with the northern banks casting their shadow over their proceedings. Mainstream parties have been rapidly losing members to left and to right. The executive director of the Paris-based research group EuropaNova attributes the general disenchantment to “a mood of angry impotence as the real power to shape events largely shifted from national political leaders [who, in principle at least, are subject to democratic politics] to the market, the institutions of the European Union and corporations”, quite in accord with neoliberal doctrine. Very similar processes are under way in the United States, for somewhat similar reasons, a matter of significance and concern not just for the country but, because of US power, for the world. The rising opposition to the neoliberal assault highlights another crucial aspect of the standard convention: it sets aside the public, which often fails to accept the approved role of “spectators” (rather than “participants”) assigned to it in liberal democratic theory. Such disobedience has always been of concern to the dominant classes. Just keeping to American history, George Washington regarded the common people who formed the militias that he was to command as “an exceedingly dirty and nasty people [evincing] an unaccountable kind of stupidity in the lower class of these people”. In Violent Politics, his masterful review of insurgencies from “the American insurgency” to contemporary Afghanistan and Iraq, William Polk concludes that General Washington “was so anxious to sideline [the fighters he despised] that he came close to losing the Revolution”. Indeed, he “might have actually done so” had France not massively intervened and “saved the Revolution”, which until then had been won by guerrillas – whom we would now call “terrorists” – while Washington’s British-style army “was defeated time after time and almost lost the war”. It is often argued that the enormous public opposition to the invasion of Iraq had no effect. That seems incorrect to me A common feature of successful insurgencies, Polk records, is that once popular support dissolves after victory, the leadership suppresses the “dirty and nasty people” who actually won the war with guerrilla tactics and terror, for fear that they might challenge class privilege. The elites’ contempt for “the lower class of these people” has taken various forms throughout the years. In recent times one expression of this contempt is the call for passivity and obedience (“moderation in democracy”) by liberal internationalists reacting to the dangerous democratizing effects of the popular movements of the 1960s. Sometimes states do choose to follow public opinion, eliciting much fury in centers of power. One dramatic case was in 2003, when the Bush administration called on Turkey to join its invasion of Iraq. Ninety-five percent of Turks opposed that course of action and, to the amazement and horror of Washington, the Turkish government adhered to their views. Turkey was bitterly condemned for this departure from responsible behavior. Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz, designated by the press as the “idealist-in-chief” of the administration, berated the Turkish military for permitting the malfeasance of the government and demanded an apology. Unperturbed by these and innumerable other illustrations of our fabled “yearning for democracy”, respectable commentary continued to laud President George W Bush for his dedication to “democracy promotion”, or sometimes criticized him for his naivete in thinking that an outside power could impose its democratic yearnings on others. The Turkish public was not alone. Global opposition to US-UK aggression was overwhelming. Support for Washington’s war plans scarcely reached 10% almost anywhere, according to international polls. Opposition sparked huge worldwide protests, in the United States as well, probably the first time in history that imperial aggression was strongly protested even before it was officially launched. On the front page of the New York Times, journalist Patrick Tyler reported that “there may still be two superpowers on the planet: the United States and world public opinion”. Unprecedented protest in the US was a manifestation of the opposition to aggression that began decades earlier in the condemnation of the US wars in Indochina, reaching a scale that was substantial and influential, even if far too late. By 1967, when the antiwar movement was becoming a significant force, military historian and Vietnam specialist Bernard Fall warned that “Vietnam as a cultural and historic entity … is threatened with extinction … [as] the countryside literally dies under the blows of the largest military machine ever unleashed on an area of this size”. But the antiwar movement did become a force that could not be ignored. Nor could it be ignored when Ronald Reagan came into office determined to launch an assault on Central America. His administration mimicked closely the steps John F Kennedy had taken 20 years earlier in launching the war against South Vietnam, but had to back off because of the kind of vigorous public protest that had been lacking in the early 1960s. The assault was awful enough. The victims have yet to recover. But what happened to South Vietnam and later all of Indochina, where “the second superpower” imposed its impediments only much later in the conflict, was incomparably worse. It is often argued that the enormous public opposition to the invasion of Iraq had no effect. That seems incorrect to me. Again, the invasion was horrifying enough, and its aftermath is utterly grotesque. Nevertheless, it could have been far worse. Vice-President Dick Cheney, secretary of defense Donald Rumsfeld, and the rest of Bush’s top officials could never even contemplate the sort of measures that President Kennedy and President Lyndon Johnson adopted 40 years earlier largely without protest. There is far more to say, of course, about the factors in determining state policy that are put to the side when we adopt the standard convention that states are the actors in international affairs. But with such nontrivial caveats as these, let us nevertheless adopt the convention, at least as a first approximation to reality. Then the question of who rules the world leads at once to such concerns as China’s rise to power and its challenge to the US and “world order”, the new cold war simmering in eastern Europe , the global war on terror, American hegemony and American decline, and a range of similar considerations. The challenges faced by western power at the outset of 2016 are usefully summarized within the conventional framework by Gideon Rachman, chief foreign-affairs columnist for the London Financial Times. He begins by reviewing the western picture of world order: “Ever since the end of the cold war, the overwhelming power of the US military has been the central fact of international politics.” This is particularly crucial in three regions: east Asia, where “the US navy has become used to treating the Pacific as an ‘American lake’”; Europe, where Nato – meaning the United States, which “accounts for a staggering three-quarters of Nato’s military spending” – “guarantees the territorial integrity of its member states”; and the Middle East, where giant US naval and air bases “exist to reassure friends and to intimidate rivals”. The problem of world order today, Rachman continues, is that “these security orders are now under challenge in all three regions” because of Russian intervention in Ukraine and Syria, and because of China turning its nearby seas from an American lake to “clearly contested water”. The fundamental question of international relations, then, is whether the US should “accept that other major powers should have some kind of zone of influence in their neighborhoods”. Rachman thinks it should, for reasons of “diffusion of economic power around the world – combined with simple common sense”. There are, to be sure, ways of looking at the world from different standpoints. But let us keep to these three regions, surely critically important ones. Beginning with the “American lake”, some eyebrows might be raised over the report in mid-December 2015 that “an American B-52 bomber on a routine mission over the South China Sea unintentionally flew within two nautical miles of an artificial island built by China , senior defense officials said, exacerbating a hotly divisive issue for Washington and Beijing”. Those familiar with the grim record of the 70 years of the nuclear weapons era will be all too aware that this is the kind of incident that has often come perilously close to igniting terminal nuclear war. One need not be a supporter of China’s provocative and aggressive actions in the South China Sea to notice that the incident did not involve a Chinese nuclear-capable bomber in the Caribbean, or off the coast of California, where China has no pretensions of establishing a “Chinese lake”. Luckily for the world. Chinese leaders understand very well that their country’s maritime trade routes are ringed with hostile powers from Japan through the Malacca Straits and beyond, backed by overwhelming US military force. Accordingly, China is proceeding to expand westward with extensive investments and careful moves toward integration. In part, these developments are within the framework of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), which includes the central Asian states and Russia , and soon India and Pakistan with Iran as one of the observers – a status that was denied to the US, which was also called on to close all military bases in the region . China is constructing a modernized version of the old silk roads, with the intent not only of integrating the region under Chinese influence, but also of reaching Europe and the Middle Eastern oil-producing regions. It is pouring huge sums into creating an integrated Asian energy and commercial system, with extensive high-speed rail lines and pipelines. One element of the program is a highway through some of the world’s tallest mountains to the new Chinese-developed port of Gwadar in Pakistan, which will protect oil shipments from potential US interference. The program may also, China and Pakistan hope, spur industrial development in Pakistan, which the United States has not undertaken despite massive military aid, and might also provide an incentive for Pakistan to clamp down on domestic terrorism, a serious issue for China in western Xinjiang province. Gwadar will be part of China’s “string of pearls”, bases being constructed in the Indian Ocean for commercial purposes but potentially also for military use, with the expectation that China might someday be able to project power as far as the Persian Gulf for the first time in the modern era. All of these moves remain immune to Washington’s overwhelming military power, short of annihilation by nuclear war, which would destroy the US as well. In 2015, China also established the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), with itself as the main shareholder. Fifty-six nations participated in the opening in Beijing in June, including US allies Australia, Britain and others which joined in defiance of Washington’s wishes. The US and Japan were absent. Some analysts believe that the new bank might turn out to be a competitor to the Bretton Woods institutions (the IMF and the World Bank), in which the United States holds veto power. There are also some expectations that the SCO might eventually become a counterpart to Nato. Turning to the second region, eastern Europe, there is a crisis brewing at the Nato-Russian border. It is no small matter. In his illuminating and judicious scholarly study of the region, Frontline Ukraine: Crisis in the Borderlands, Richard Sakwa writes – all too plausibly – that the “Russo-Georgian war of August 2008 was in effect the first of the ‘wars to stop Nato enlargement’; the Ukraine crisis of 2014 is the second. It is not clear whether humanity would survive a third.” The west sees Nato enlargement as benign. Not surprisingly, Russia, along with much of the Global South, has a different opinion, as do some prominent western voices. George Kennan warned early on that Nato enlargement is a “tragic mistake”, and he was joined by senior American statesmen in an open letter to the White House describing it as a “policy error of historic proportions”. The present crisis has its origins in 1991, with the end of the cold war and the collapse of the Soviet Union. There were then two contrasting visions of a new security system and political economy in Eurasia. In Sakwa’s words, one vision was of a “‘Wider Europe’, with the EU at its heart but increasingly coterminous with the Euro-Atlantic security and political community; and on the other side there [was] the idea of ‘Greater Europe’, a vision of a continental Europe, stretching from Lisbon to Vladivostok, that has multiple centers, including Brussels, Moscow and Ankara, but with a common purpose in overcoming the divisions that have traditionally plagued the continent”. Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev was the major proponent of Greater Europe, a concept that also had European roots in Gaullism and other initiatives. However, as Russia collapsed under the devastating market reforms of the 1990s, the vision faded, only to be renewed as Russia began to recover and seek a place on the world stage under Vladimir Putin who, along with his associate Dmitry Medvedev, has repeatedly “called for the geopolitical unification of all of ‘Greater Europe’ from Lisbon to Vladivostok, to create a genuine ‘strategic partnership’”. These initiatives were “greeted with polite contempt”, Sakwa writes, regarded as “little more than a cover for the establishment of a ‘Greater Russia’ by stealth” and an effort to “drive a wedge” between North America and western Europe. Such concerns trace back to earlier cold war fears that Europe might become a “third force” independent of both the great and minor superpowers and moving toward closer links to the latter (as can be seen in Willy Brandt’s Ostpolitik and other initiatives). The western response to Russia’s collapse was triumphalist. It was hailed as signaling “the end of history”, the final victory of western capitalist democracy, almost as if Russia were being instructed to revert to its pre-world war I status as a virtual economic colony of the west. Nato enlargement began at once, in violation of verbal assurances to Gorbachev that Nato forces would not move “one inch to the east” after he agreed that a unified Germany could become a Nato member – a remarkable concession, in the light of history. That discussion kept to East Germany. The possibility that Nato might expand beyond Germany was not discussed with Gorbachev, even if privately  considered. Soon, Nato did begin to move beyond, right to the borders of Russia. The general mission of Nato was officially changed to a mandate to protect “crucial infrastructure” of the global energy system, sea lanes and pipelines, giving it a global area of operations. Furthermore, under a crucial western revision of the now widely heralded doctrine of “responsibility to protect”, sharply different from the official UN version, Nato may now also serve as an intervention force under US command. Of particular concern to Russia are plans to expand Nato to Ukraine. These plans were articulated explicitly at the Bucharest Nato summit of April 2008, when Georgia and Ukraine were promised eventual membership in Nato. The wording was unambiguous: “Nato welcomes Ukraine’s and Georgia’s Euro-Atlantic aspirations for membership in Nato. We agreed today that these countries will become members of Nato.” With the “Orange Revolution” victory of pro-western candidates in Ukraine in 2004, State Department representative Daniel Fried rushed there and “emphasized US support for Ukraine’s Nato and Euro-Atlantic aspirations”, as a WikiLeaks report revealed. As in the case of China, one does not have to regard Putin’s moves favorably to understand the logic behind them Russia’s concerns are easily understandable. They are outlined by international relations scholar John Mearsheimer in the leading US establishment journal, Foreign Affairs. He writes that “the taproot of the current crisis [over Ukraine] is Nato expansion and Washington’s commitment to move Ukraine out of Moscow’s orbit and integrate it into the west”, which Putin viewed as “a direct threat to Russia’s core interests”. “Who can blame him?” Mearsheimer asks, pointing out that “Washington may not like Moscow’s position, but it should understand the logic behind it”. That should not be too difficult. After all, as everyone knows, “The United States does not tolerate distant great powers deploying military forces anywhere in the western hemisphere, much less on its borders.” In fact, the US stand is far stronger. It does not tolerate what is officially called “successful defiance” of the Monroe Doctrine of 1823, which declared (but could not yet implement) US control of the hemisphere. And a small country that carries out such successful defiance may be subjected to “the terrors of the earth” and a crushing embargo – as happened to Cuba. We need not ask how the United States would have reacted had the countries of Latin America joined the Warsaw Pact, with plans for Mexico and Canada to join as well. The merest hint of the first tentative steps in that direction would have been “terminated with extreme prejudice”, to adopt CIA lingo. As in the case of China, one does not have to regard Putin’s moves and motives favorably to understand the logic behind them, nor to grasp the importance of understanding that logic instead of issuing imprecations against it. As in the case of China, a great deal is at stake, reaching as far – literally – as questions of survival. Let us turn to the third region of major concern, the (largely) Islamic world, also the scene of the global war on terror (GWOT) that George W Bush declared in 2001 after the 9/11 terrorist attack. To be more accurate, re- declared. The GWOT was declared by the Reagan administration when it took office, with fevered rhetoric about a “plague spread by depraved opponents of civilization itself” (as Reagan put it) and a “return to barbarism in the modern age” (the words of George Shultz, his secretary of state). The original GWOT has been quietly removed from history. It very quickly turned into a murderous and destructive terrorist war afflicting Central America, southern Africa, and the Middle East, with grim repercussions to the present, even leading to condemnation of the United States by the World Court (which Washington dismissed). In any event, it is not the right story for history, so it is gone. The success of the Bush-Obama version of GWOT can readily be evaluated on direct inspection. When the war was declared, the terrorist targets were confined to a small corner of tribal Afghanistan. They were protected by Afghans, who mostly disliked or despised them, under the tribal code of hospitality – which baffled Americans when poor peasants refused “to turn over Osama bin Laden for the, to them, astronomical sum of $25m”. There are good reasons to believe that a well-constructed police action, or even serious diplomatic negotiations with the Taliban, might have placed those suspected of the 9/11 crimes in American hands for trial and sentencing. But such options were off the table. Instead, the reflexive choice was large-scale violence – not with the goal of overthrowing the Taliban (that came later) but to make clear US contempt for tentative Taliban offers of the possible extradition of bin Laden. How serious these offers were we do not know, since the possibility of exploring them was never entertained. Or perhaps the US was just intent on “trying to show its muscle, score a victory and scare everyone in the world. They don’t care about the suffering of the Afghans or how many people we will lose”. That was the judgment of the highly respected anti-Taliban leader Abdul Haq, one of the many oppositionists who condemned the American bombing campaign launched in October 2001 as “a big setback” for their efforts to overthrow the Taliban from within, a goal they considered within their reach. His judgment is confirmed by Richard A Clarke, who was chairman of the Counterterrorism Security Group at the White House under President George W Bush when the plans to attack Afghanistan were made. As Clarke describes the meeting, when informed that the attack would violate international law, “the president yelled in the narrow conference room, ‘I don’t care what the international lawyers say, we are going to kick some ass.’” The attack was also bitterly opposed by the major aid organizations working in Afghanistan, who warned that millions were on the verge of starvation and that the consequences might be horrendous. The consequences for poor Afghanistan years later need hardly be reviewed. The next target of the sledgehammer was Iraq. The US-UK invasion, utterly without credible pretext, is the major crime of the 21st century. The invasion led to the death of hundreds of thousands of people in a country where the civilian society had already been devastated by American and British sanctions that were regarded as “genocidal” by the two distinguished international diplomats who administered them, and resigned in protest for this reason. The invasion also generated millions of refugees, largely destroyed the country, and instigated a sectarian conflict that is now tearing apart Iraq and the entire region. It is an astonishing fact about our intellectual and moral culture that in informed and enlightened circles it can be called, blandly, “the liberation of Iraq”. Pentagon and British Ministry of Defense polls found that only 3% of Iraqis regarded the US security role in their neighborhood as legitimate, less than 1% believed that “coalition” (US-UK) forces were good for their security, 80% opposed the presence of coalition forces in the country, and a majority supported attacks on coalition troops. Afghanistan has been destroyed beyond the possibility of reliable polling, but there are indications that something similar may be true there as well. Particularly in Iraq the United States suffered a severe defeat, abandoning its official war aims, and leaving the country under the influence of the sole victor, Iran. The sledgehammer was also wielded elsewhere, notably in Libya, where the three traditional imperial powers (Britain, France and the US) procured security council resolution 1973 and instantly violated it, becoming the air force of the rebels. The effect was to undercut the possibility of a peaceful, negotiated settlement; sharply increase casualties (by at least a factor of 10, according to political scientist Alan Kuperman); leave Libya in ruins, in the hands of warring militias; and, more recently, to provide the Islamic State with a base that it can use to spread terror beyond. Quite sensible diplomatic proposals by the African Union, accepted in principle by Libya’s Muammar Gaddafi, were ignored by the imperial triumvirate, as Africa specialist Alex de Waal reviews. A huge flow of weapons and jihadis has spread terror and violence from west Africa (now the champion for terrorist murders) to the Levant, while the Nato attack also sent a flood of refugees from Africa to Europe. Yet another triumph of “humanitarian intervention”, and, as the long and often ghastly record reveals, not an unusual one, going back to its modern origins four centuries ago."
"Obama Hints at Sanctions Against China Over Cyberattacks","Advertisement Supported by By  Julie Hirschfeld Davis WASHINGTON — President Obama warned on Wednesday that his administration was ready to take action against China over online attacks carried out by Beijing or its proxies, publicly raising the specter of sanctions a week before President Xi Jinping arrives in the United States for a state visit. “We are preparing a number of measures that will indicate to the Chinese that this is not just a matter of us being mildly upset, but is something that will put significant strains on the bilateral relationship if not resolved,” Mr. Obama said in a question-and-answer session with business leaders on economic issues. “We are prepared to take some countervailing actions in order to get their attention.” “My hope,” Mr. Obama added, “is that it gets resolved short of that.” The remarks seemed calibrated to pressure Mr. Xi to agree to address online security concerns, which Mr. Obama said would “probably be one of the biggest topics” of the talks next week. They also seemed to suggest that while sanctions are unlikely to be imposed on China before the summit meeting, it is increasingly likely that some penalties will be imposed afterward. The public threat of sanctions represented an intensifying of what has until now been a quiet, although increasingly intense, effort to warn the Chinese that the administration will not tolerate recent breaches and thefts of intellectual property, including one at the Office of Personnel Management . That breach, revealed this year, compromised tens of millions of security files of federal employees. Mr. Obama has faced a difficult problem in deciding whether and when to apply sanctions. Some administration officials are concerned about poisoning the atmosphere for Mr. Xi’s visit and some believe that the threat of such penalties could help extract concessions. “They’ve just run out of time to deal with sanctions before this top-level meeting,” said Patrick M. Cronin , the director of the Asia-Pacific Security Program at the Center for a New American Security. “The administration is, on the one hand, looking for as much cooperation as they can get from Xi Jinping and China’s leadership and, at the same time, saying: ‘Here is the stick of sanctions. We’re not going to use it right now; we’re going to wait to see what you say at the summit about good-faith progress on cyber rules of the road, but if we’re not satisfied, sanctions will follow,’ ” Mr. Cronin said. The breaches were a source of friction last month when Susan E. Rice, the national security adviser, traveled to Beijing to meet with top Chinese officials. And the White House said on Saturday that Meng Jianzhu, a Communist Party envoy, spent much of last week in Washington meeting with American security and intelligence officials on online security issues, including a session with Ms. Rice that involved a “frank and open exchange.” “U.S. and Chinese officials are engaged in candid, blunt discussions about our concerns in this policy area,” Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, told reporters on Wednesday. “You have heard the U.S. government make clear that we have significant concerns with Chinese behavior.” He said Mr. Obama “was intentionally nonspecific” on Wednesday over possible actions against China, although he noted that the president signed an executive order this year enabling him to issue sanctions against individuals or organizations deemed responsible for such attacks. “Among states, there has to be a framework that is analogous to what we’ve done with nuclear power, because nobody stands to gain” from the attacks, Mr. Obama said on Wednesday. He said defining such a plan “requires, I think, some tough negotiations.” “If we and the Chinese are able to coalesce around a process for negotiations, then I think we can bring a lot of other countries along,” the president said. Still, despite repeated efforts, Mr. Obama has been unable to bring about such a meeting of the minds on the issue of computer spying and theft. The president first raised the issue with Mr. Xi in 2013, when the two held their first lengthy talks at the Sunnylands estate in Rancho Mirage, Calif., but hacking has continued to bedevil the relationship between the United States and China. Last year, China dropped out of a security working group with the United States after the Justice Department indicted five Chinese military officials on charges of stealing intellectual property from American companies. But those sorts of charges may be problematic in the Office of Personnel Management case, given that the United States has distinguished between normal espionage by governments and the theft of commercial data. Online attacks are among several difficult subjects that loom over Mr. Xi’s visit. Mr. Obama is likely to confront Mr. Xi over China’s recent activities in the South China Sea, a matter that the Chinese argue is a regional one in which the United States has no business interfering. Mr. Obama acknowledged the tension on Wednesday, describing a tense relationship. “As they have matured, what we’ve said to them is, ‘With power comes responsibility, so now you’ve got to step up,’ ” Mr. Obama said. “In some cases, they still feel that when we call them on issues like their behavior in the South China Sea, or on intellectual property theft, that we are trying to contain them.” Advertisement"
"China Presents a Four-Point Proposal for Resolving the Civil War in Syria","Advertisement By NEIL MacFARQUHAR NOV. 1, 2012  BEIRUT, Lebanon — China unveiled a vague four-point peace plan for Syria on Thursday that called for a cease-fire in stages and a political transition to end the conflict. The plan lacked crucial specific details, however, like what role President Bashar al-Assad of Syria would play in any transition. China has been one of his main international backers since the uprising started in March 2011. But the fact that China’s announcement came one day after the United States made it clear that the Syrian opposition needed new leadership underscored a subtle shift in international attitudes toward resolving the conflict. The Syrian government and the opposition have battled to a bloody stalemate after 20 months, at a cost of more than 30,000 lives, and there is a sense that fresh diplomatic opportunities might change the dynamic. Advertisement “There has been a generalized shift toward a recognition that developments on the ground have created space for new leaders, new organizational frameworks and new governance to emerge,” said Steven Heydemann of the United States Institute of Peace, who is working with the opposition on possible transition plans. Advertisement Although the opposition has yet to gain lasting control over any significant city, Mr. Heydemann said that certain areas had fallen outside government control to the point that local leaders and councils had emerged as alternatives with which to carry on negotiations. The most recent attempt at a cease-fire during the four days of the Id al-Adfa holiday last weekend, which was negotiated by the international envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi , failed, and each side still believes it can fight its way to victory. But there have been subtle hints that alternate possibilities are not being rejected out of hand. In Syria, for example, a columnist in the state-controlled newspaper Al Thawra suggested on Wednesday that room exists for further efforts, while reiterating the government position that outside plots led to the cease-fire’s failure. It praised the Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, for saying at a recent news conference that he would speak to all political parties involved. “That is the first necessary step for anyone really and earnestly seeking a political solution,” the columnist, Assad Abboud, wrote. “Sanctions, boycotts, and laying siege to one party in an attempt to strengthen another leave no objective chance for political action that seeks a solution.” There is also public opinion to take into account. Activists note that the Syrian public is exhausted by the conflict, and increasingly annoyed by fighters on both sides. “People inside want any solution; they want security,” said Rami, a young activist in Beirut who would be identified only by one name out of concern for his safety. “No one can stand the pressure anymore.” “If we want to be honest, we’re waiting for a truce, we want to negotiate for him to leave,” he added, referring to President Assad. Advertisement China has long stood behind Moscow in supporting Damascus, also vetoing three Security Council resolutions meant to address the conflict. But Mr. Brahimi, the envoy, has insisted that for negotiations on a political solution to move forward, he needs the backing of a unified Security Council. The Chinese proposal seemed intended to address that condition. The Chinese Foreign Ministry proposal began with an expression of support for Mr. Brahimi. It called for humanitarian aid for refugees from the conflict without regard for political or military demands. A cease-fire should be carried out “by district and in stages,” the proposal said without elaborating, with the final goal an end to all fighting. Government institutions, it said, should continue to function, while the parties to the conflict identify members of negotiating bodies to participate in the transition process.

You must select a newsletter to subscribe to. “For China to bring up this proposal now is to bring the global community together, cooperate with Brahimi’s mediation efforts and push on the political resolution process and realize the cease-fire as soon as possible,” Hong Lei, the spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, told reporters. But diplomats who had seen the proposal said it left out as much as it contained. It did not address the utter failure of the last cease-fire, for example, nor suggest any kind of timetable. All five permanent members of the Security Council signed off on an agreement in Geneva last June that they would try to achieve a peaceful political transition in Syria. Mr. Brahimi is trying to add specifics to the bare bones of that plan. He, too, is not working under any specific timetable. Having just visited Moscow and Beijing, he denied reports that he would present the Security Council with a more specific plan in the coming weeks. An article on Friday about China’s proposal of a vague four-point peace plan for Syria that included a cease-fire in stages misidentified the recent four-day Muslim holiday during which a negotiated cease-fire between Syrian government and rebel forces failed. It is Id al-Adfa, not Id al-Fitr. Hwaida Saad contributed reporting.

"At Sharjah Biennial, Interpretation of a Region Defined by Rebellion","Advertisement By VINITA BHARADWAJ MARCH 9, 2011  DUBAI — At first glance, the painting “Blessing Upon the Land of My Love,” by the Pakistani artist Imran Qureshi, looks like the scene of a massacre. A canvas of red drips and splotches, it covers the floor and steps of a tranquil courtyard inside Bait Al Serkal, a heritage building and former hospital in the emirate of Sharjah. On closer examination, however, the floor is also decorated with foliage typical of the Basohli Hills in Kashmir, painted by Mr. Qureshi in the modern miniature style for which he is best known. The site-specific project is one of more than 65 works specially commissioned by the Sharjah Biennial for its 10th edition starting Wednesday — an eight-week program of visual art, film, choreography, music, video and publishing, built around an enigmatic theme: “Plot for a Biennial.” Jointly curated by Suzanne Cotter, the British curator of the Guggenheim Abu Dhabi Project, and Rasha Salti, the Lebanese creative director of ArteEast in New York, in association with the Lebanese artist Haig Aivazian, “Plot” is scripted around a constellation of keywords like treason, necessity, insurrection, affiliation, corruption, devotion, disclosure and translation. Advertisement “Based on the theme, I was interested in the architecture’s space and my own vocabulary as an artist,” Mr. Qureshi said of his painting. “In this courtyard, I saw a quietness and sadness. The courtyard, that was central to the region’s architecture and historically a peaceful enclave in homes, has now been replaced with violence in the Middle East and Pakistan.” Advertisement Ms. Cotter said: “Arriving at the ‘Plot’s’ lexicon was a conversational process. We thought of the urgent things pressing for representation through an artistic medium. We wrote down words that were meaningful to us and the contemporary artistic context, but at the same time wanted to explore the framework for a biennial and the times we live in.” Established in 1993, the Sharjah Biennial long predates the Gulf region’s many art fairs and high-profile museum projects. Early editions focused on local and classical art forms, but in 2003 it stepped boldly into contemporary arts and has since become a major fixture on the Middle East’s contemporary art calendar. In 2009 it attracted more than 75,000 visitors. While the Gulf’s rulers have clearly turned to art to project a political message of culture and stability, Jack Persekian, director of the Sharjah Art Foundation, which organizes the biennial, says there has never been any pressure to conform to a preferred perspective or toe a propaganda line. “If anything, we’ve been told to steer clear of market and commercial influences,” Mr. Persekian said. Sharjah, one of the seven states that make up the United Arab Emirates , eschews the flamboyance of its better-known neighbor Dubai and lacks the financial clout of the federal capital, Abu Dhabi. Instead, it has positioned itself as the federation’s cultural center since the early 1980s. “There’s a vibrant local cultural movement in Sharjah. The ruler is a keen patron of the arts and playwright,” Mr. Persekian said, referring to the emir, Sheikh Sultan bin Mohammed al-Qasimi. “The emirate has several museums, an active fine arts society, theater society and an annual book fair.” The emirate also has a strong focus on Islamic values, strict laws prohibiting the sale and possession of alcohol, and a “decency and public conduct” code — all of which, taken together, have given it a reputation as one of the most conservatively Islamic states in the federation. Advertisement Yet over the years, the biennial has managed to escape being a strictly Islamic art platform, engaging audiences with works that are powerful in their content, sometimes political in their message and broad in their appeal. “I think its standing in the international art scene and biennial circuit has increased since its foray into the contemporary arts,” Ms. Cotter said. For this edition, more than 90 artists from the Middle East, North Africa, Europe, South Asia and the United States have contributed to installations and performances that will be spread throughout the emirate’s open spaces, historic venues and city streets — even its cricket stadium.

Its biggest challenge, however, is to bring in local audiences. “One of the intriguing aspects of curating for the Sharjah Biennial was identifying the audience,” said Ms. Salti, the co-curator. “We had fragments of information about the demographic, but nothing clearly defined.” That, said Mr. Persekian, was why it had been imperative for artists to visit Sharjah ahead of the exhibition, to put their projects and ideas into context. “They needed,” he said, “to take into account the demographics, the particularities of Sharjah and the historical emphasis on culture and art that has always been independent in nature.” An example is the Palestinian artist Khalil Rabah, who said that only when he visited the Sharjah Art Museum, one of the venues of the biennial, did he know, instantly, where he wanted his installation, “Art Exhibition,” to be displayed. “They had to be centered between the museum’s permanent Orientalist collection and another biennial project,” he said of his 50 photorealist paintings, which explore the historiography of modern art in Palestine. The installation draws on archive material to delve into questions about modern Palestinian art — its protagonists, platforms and documentation. In order to achieve this act of museographical simulation, he selected 50 photographs of exhibitions of Palestinian art that took place in different places around the world, from 1961 to the present. Advertisement Amid the tumult of Arab revolution and rebellion that provides the backdrop to this biennial, “art, exhibitions and biennials have never been more important to the region,” Mr. Rabah said. “Art should be a priority at every moment. It’s necessary for a healthy and functioning democracy,” he said. “It should play a vital role in changing the political discourse and not be put aside until things get better. We must engage and communicate with people.” To foster an essential dialogue between the artists and their audiences, the biennial has designed a circuit built around a series of encounters. Throughout the designated biennial sites, commissioned works have been placed in such a way as to bring them face to face with visitors and residents. One of the more uplifting of these works is “Lebanese Rocket Society: Elements for a Monument,” by the Lebanese film and visual artists Joana Hadijithomas and Khalil Joreige. A “rocket” made of iron and marble, standing 8 meters, or about 26 feet, is a reconstruction of Cedar IV, one of nine launch vehicles produced by the Lebanese Rocket Society between 1960 and 1967. Lebanon’s nascent space program is now long forgotten, but at the time it was a cause for national celebration whenever a Cedar rocket flew. For the biennial, Ms. Hadijithomas and Mr. Joreige have built a mock rocket that induces a sense of time warp crossed with multiple ambiguities — is it a rocket, for example, or could it be a missile? Mr. Joreige says the piece is not intended to romanticize nostalgia. “It is the documentation of an anecdote that didn’t lead to anything,” he said. “But it makes one laugh about the possibility of a Lebanese space program. We question the purpose of a monument, the meaning of a monument, by producing a piece that reminds us of the way we were. “Feel free to interpret it as you like.” A version of this article appears in print on March 10, 2011, in The International Herald Tribune.

"Midlevel U.S. Chains Move Into Fast-Food Hungry Gulf","Advertisement By SARA HAMDAN SEPT. 12, 2012  DUBAI — After twelve years of running two small, organic tea shops in the New York borough of Brooklyn, Jonathan Spiel had to close one down when his landlord increased the rent in 2009. Facing that setback, Mr. Spiel decided to look into selling Tea Lounge franchises to expand into new markets and keep his business going. The Tea Lounge’s first franchise opened this year, in Kuwait. “When I and my family and friends first heard ‘Kuwait,’ it seemed a little out of the blue,” Mr. Spiel, the Tea Lounge’s founder, said. “There are limitations and we’ll have to adapt our concept, but the key is that the ritual of socializing over tea and coffee for hours already exists there in people’s homes,” he said. “We want to bring it into the cafe.” Big name American brands have not been able to open franchises in the Middle East fast enough to satisfy demand in recent years. Fast-food concepts like KFC and Subway have been popular for years, but recent additions include IHOP, The Cheesecake Factory and Papa John’s Pizza. These franchises have the backing of major family-run businesses, like the Al Shaya Group in Saudi Arabia. Advertisement The success of these well-known American names has encouraged midlevel brands, like Tea Lounge, to venture into the region in search of financing and some market share. And often, it is Arab businessmen that reach out to them. Advertisement When an Arizona-based employee of the Al Arbash Group, a private firm based in Kuwait, approached Mr. Spiel about the idea of expanding the Tea Lounge, the founder had not yet entertained the thought. But the interest from the Arbash group could not have come at a better time: With just one cafe on his hands, Mr. Spiel was eagerly looking for new avenues of growth. “It’s been difficult for small businesses to get loans for a while now in the U.S., and even when banks do give money, it’s just not enough,” he said. In the Gulf, he said, people “will always have money, which is appealing.” In December, Tea Lounge will open a new store in a mall in Kuwait. There will be the same 65 kinds of loose-leaf teas, 55 kinds of coffee and a variety of snacks on offer — all organic. Unlike the cafe in Brooklyn, the Tea Lounge in Kuwait will not serve alcohol or allow live bands to perform, out of respect for cultural traditions. “We don’t have nightclubs in Kuwait; when young people want to have fun they go to a coffee shop in the mall, so what we’re doing is staying true to that and adding Tea Lounge’s community touch,” said Mohamed  Al Arbash, the franchise owner of the Tea Lounge in Kuwait and an executive at the Arbash Group.  “Since we can’t serve alcohol, for example, we target families more by offering children’s story time or movies — things like that.” Still, these franchises will face challenges, like maintaining a brand identity while adapting to new cultures. With its following of local artists and a strong attachment to the local community, the Brooklyn version of the Tea Lounge will be very different from the Kuwait branch, despite keeping the same cafe layout and menu items. It is even trickier for an inherently American concept, like Famous Dave’s, a barbecue restaurant founded 15 years ago by Dave W. Anderson, an American Indian. Famous Dave’s has grown into a public company with 133 branches across the United States and one in Canada. Advertisement The company’s logo is a pig roasting ribs over a fire, highlighting one of its most popular dishes — an item that is hardly acceptable in the Middle East, where eating pork is often taboo. Yet Famous Dave’s plans to open up to 30 stores in the Middle East and North Africa in the next few years as part of a global expansion, said Brett Larrabee,  the company’s director for franchise development. The chain will start with two stores in Dubai before expanding further in the Middle East. Mr. Larrabee has based his regional forecasts on an analysis of other U.S. casual dining companies that have successfully entered the market, as well as population and demographic figures. The chain’s only franchise outside the United States currently is in Winnipeg, Canada. Famous Dave’s is also looking at expanding into South America, China and Asia. “When we go into these new areas, we want to meet local needs, so we’re obviously not going to sell things to people that don’t want them,” Mr. Larrabee said. “But the essence of our brand is in our barbecue flavor, which we can serve everywhere.” Famous Dave’s plans to tweak its menu to cater to local needs and find suppliers capable of providing Halal meat, which meets certain preparation guidelines and is acceptable under Islam’s dietary requirements. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter. You must select a newsletter to subscribe to. The halal concept is not foreign to Famous Dave’s, Mr. Larrabee said. The restaurant receives similar food requests in the United States, namely in Detroit and New York. Mr. Larrabee said that the chain was currently in talks with Mideast companies interested in opening a franchise, particularly in Dubai, as well as in other parts of the world. “When one part of the world is challenged, another is prospering, and there’s great opportunity for us in Dubai” and the Gulf region, he said. One mistake restaurant chains often make is to think of the Middle East as a homogeneous place, when, in fact, each country has its own legal framework and cultural norms. Advertisement This is what Wing Zone has learned after successfully entering Saudi Arabia last November. The company, an Atlanta-based restaurant chain that specializes in chicken wings, hopes to duplicate its U.S. success by opening branches in Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates. The chain says it will need to treat each market uniquely. Wing Zone was one of the first midlevel brands to enter the Middle East, according to Nick Powills,  the chief executive of No Limit Media Consulting, which focuses on the franchising market. “Lots of the big boys like McDonald’s had mastered international franchising when the economy was good, but midlevel brands started doing this after the financial crisis, when they were looking for ways out of the burdened U.S. market,” Mr. Powills said. “Breaking into the Mideast is not the easiest thing,” he continued, “it’s not like Wing Zone has brand awareness in Saudi.” Wing Zone had not specifically targeted Saudi Arabia; the company was approached by Saudi businessmen when it was looking into expand globally. The partners decided to expand in Jidda in November 2011 after seeing the potential of a growing market in the Middle East, a region in which chicken consumption is high. Encouraged by the success of the Jidda outlet — which made a profit after just one year in operation — the company is embarking on an aggressive expansion program, planning to open an additional 50 franchises in the region in the next five years. “From a financial standpoint, it doesn’t make sense for us to have one store; we’re aiming for 25 in Saudi alone,” Matt Friedman, the chief executive of Wing Zone, said from Atlanta. “Other markets on the radar are Kuwait, Jordan and Lebanon, but each country has its own rules so we start from the beginning again.” Advertisement It costs an average of $250,000 to open a franchise, while legal documents can cost up to $100,000, Mr. Powills said. The Pita Pit, an American brand with 400 outlets globally, is now gearing up for its first foray into the Middle East, with two restaurants planned for Riyadh in 2013. “International franchising is still a fairly new concept around the world, starting 20 years ago, and more so in the Mideast,” said Peter Panopoulos,  the president of Pita Pit. “Even with established regional players, it’s still more of an experiment and the process is slower and unpredictable.” A version of this article appears in print on September 13, 2012, in The International Herald Tribune.

"","Advertisement  By  The New York Times  How the election and Donald Trump’s victory looks to Opinion writers.  By  Joseph Heath  In May 2013, when journalists from both The Toronto Star and Gawker reported having viewed a video that showed Mayor Rob Ford smoking a crack pipe, many Toronto residents were shocked. Even more shocking was how little effect it had on Ford’s popularity: In one survey, 45 percent of respondents thought the report was a “hoax” and part of a “conspiracy” being perpetrated by the media against Ford. (In fact, when ultimately released, the video showed exactly what the reports said it did.) The episode revealed that a lot of Ford supporters, despite their hatred of “the system” and desire to see it disrupted, didn’t really have a clear understanding of how it works. Observing the presidential race in the United States, I have been struck by the similarities between Ford and Donald J. Trump. Just as Ford did in Toronto, Mr. Trump has exposed a strong current of what can only be described as political nihilism in the American electorate. It’s not just Trump supporters — many Western democracies are experiencing a decline of citizen trust in major social institutions and “experts” of any stripe (doctors, scientists, economists, etc.). Some of this distrust has been well earned — it will surprise no one that trust in financial institutions declined after the 2008 crisis. But at some point, an excess of doubt and distrust becomes unhealthy. It begins to undermine the possibility of public dialogue about important issues. How can we have a debate over criminal justice, for instance, when a majority of Americans refuse to believe that crime has been declining? The end point of universal doubt seems to be not progress, but corrosive cynicism. You can see this with Mr. Trump’s claim that the entire system is “rigged.” It has been taken by many of his followers as a license to believe pretty much anything that they would like to believe. The unemployment rate, immigration levels — nothing is as it seems. Inconvenient facts are just more evidence of a rigged system. The culmination of this tendency is the belief that the election as a whole is being rigged and, thus, the presidency illegitimate. Americans have also become less trusting of one another. The General Social Survey of United States adults has shown a steady decline in interpersonal trust since the 1970s. Social scientists have been fretting for decades over the decline of what they call “social capital” in America, or the ability of individuals to engage in spontaneous, voluntary cooperation. Contrary to popular self-image, the United States has traditionally been a society that enjoys very high levels of spontaneous social trust. (I once asked my Taiwanese in-laws what their prevailing stereotype of white people was. The answer surprised me: “Gullible,” I was told. Why gullible? “Because you trust strangers.”) Historically, this willingness to trust strangers has been one of the major forces driving entrepreneurialism and free enterprise in America. It is one reason small businesses in the United States find it relatively easy to find investors. This is why social capital is spoken of as a form of “capital” — it’s like a resource that can be used to achieve collective goals. Democracy depends on it as well. The decline of trust has contributed a great deal to the current predicament, in which the American system of government seems to be moving inexorably toward a constitutional crisis (perhaps the threat of the Senate blocking all Supreme Court appointments during the next presidential term). Unfortunately, social scientists have little to say about how to restore trust once it is lost. Yet Wednesday morning, this will be a major problem confronting Americans. Contemplating the difficulty of this task may be enough to encourage us to adopt a more conservative attitude toward the forms of social capital that we still enjoy. More important, it may encourage us to think more critically about the value of always thinking critically. We have become very good at questioning authority. We need to work on the harder part — when to trust authority.  By  Daniel K. Williams  Donald J. Trump was elected with a higher percentage of the white evangelical vote than any other Republican presidential candidate has ever received, and he has received strong support from prominent Christian Right leaders. Yet if Mr. Trump delivers on his promises, he will not give the religious right what its leaders have traditionally demanded or what the Republican Party platform calls for. Indeed, he will give them very little national legislation at all, but will instead offer them maximum latitude to pursue their agenda at the state level — a shift that may portend a potential breakthrough in the nation’s polarizing culture wars. National legislation has long been the goal of the religious right. When the movement emerged in the late 1970s, evangelical leaders such as Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson sought federal constitutional amendments to ban abortion and restore school prayer, because they wanted to reverse what liberal rights activists had done at the national level through the Supreme Court. In the early 21st century, leaders such as James Dobson continued this trend by persuading   President George W. Bush to endorse a constitutional amendment proposal to define marriage as exclusively heterosexual. In recent years, evangelicals have become so concerned about protecting their own religious liberty against federal mandates or court decisions that they have given less attention to imposing a moral agenda on the rest of the nation. Although the Republican Party platform continues to promise a constitutional amendment protecting human life from the moment of conception, the pro-life movement has not made any serious attempts to pass that amendment since the 1980s. Nor has there been much talk in the last decade of a national ban on same-sex marriage. Mr. Trump is well positioned to promote a further shift away from national moral regulation. For much of his adult life, he held culturally libertarian views on abortion and gay rights, and he evinced little interest in the religious right’s agenda. Early in his campaign, he expressed discomfort with conservative evangelicals’ opposition to the rights of transgender people to use the public restroom of their choice. But he quickly came to embrace a “states’ rights” position on same-sex marriage and transgender rights, a position that would allow culturally liberal New Yorkers the right to pursue different policies than cultural conservatives in Mississippi or North Dakota. And while Mr. Trump stumbled over abortion during his campaign, the policy that he ultimately reverted to was to leave abortion legalization up to the states — an outcome that he would try to ensure by nominating conservative Supreme Court justices who might overturn Roe v. Wade. Mr. Trump has gone further than any previous Republican presidential nominee in a generation in insisting that the religious right should enact its agenda at the state, rather than federal, level.  Although this was the policy position of many Republicans during the 1970s (including President Gerald Ford), religious right activists persuaded the G.O.P. in the early 1980s to abandon its states-rights approach to abortion and other social issues, and promise national legislation to implement the religious right’s agenda. Mr. Trump is leading the party back to its more traditional stance. While many liberals will find this outcome unsatisfactory — since it offers them no opportunity to secure national protection for individual rights that they consider inalienable — it may be the only compromise solution that can give both conservatives and liberals the freedom to pursue their own agenda at the local level without fear of a national backlash. If a socially libertarian New Yorker can deliver this compromise to the conservative white rural evangelical voters who put him in office, both conservatives and liberals should see that for what it is: a landmark opportunity to move beyond the culture wars.  By  Marwan Bishara  Just when the people of the Middle East thought things couldn’t get any worse, Donald J. Trump is elected president of the United States. Now, their apprehension about the president-elect dwarfs their disappointment with President Obama. It could be a blessing in disguise. America, in one magic moment, you’ve revealed how you’ve changed. For the worse. Poor you, you feel so insecure, vulnerable and fragile. Like the rest of us. So, instead of reaching for your famed “can-do” spirit, lifting yourselves up by the bootstraps, you turned to a strident, bellicose type of nationalism. The kind usually associated with strutting generalissimos of Third World nations with their chests covered with made-up, self-awarded medals. Maybe the people of the Middle East will look and realize that you are no longer the Great Democracy to emulate. That your modern style of empire and your role as keeper of the world order for the world’s own good are stumbling and failing, even in your own eyes; and that we in the Middle East should not be turning to you for rescue. For as long as I can remember, you’ve been on a self-assigned mission to change the Middle East. Indeed, the world. Now, it seems as if the change has flowed the other way. You’ve voted to reduce your liberties. To narrow the range of people entitled to justice and equality before the law. To live in a place where the police should not be criticized; where fighting political correctness is more important than fighting racism; where Muslims are suspected and people who appear Hispanic can be rounded up if they’re not carrying their papers. In this election you’ve revealed that your people — like Russians, Hungarians, Iraqis, Iranians and others whose politics you normally look down on — will choose a narrow, nonsensical nationalist ethos when they feel threatened by uncertainty. Your imperial outreach allowed you to experience other cultures, but now you’ve chosen to shrink your outlook, with the expectation that the world will continue to revolve around you. It won’t. Like the rest of us, you’re now divided between those who want to make their nation great again alone and those who want to make it great together. O.K., enough about you; let’s talk about us. We in the Middle East can’t decipher what exactly your incoming president wants from us. I don’t think he knows, either. Mr. Trump said he would bring back torture and ban Muslims from entering America, and he compared the threat of “radical Islam” to Soviet Communism. He wants less engagement in the region, and fewer “free riders” like the Saudis who don’t pay enough for American protection. And he wants the United States to abandon the costly nation-building in the Middle East. What nation-building? In Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Yemen, Libya and Somalia, civil wars continue unabated. The Arab and Muslim worlds only hope the United States stops contributing to the destruction.
Mr. Trump does not exactly seem concerned for the wishes of Middle Easterners and their right to live in peace. It sounds more like what he really wants to do is pal around with other strutting, authoritarian types. Expect him to cozy up to Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, and join him in supporting Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad. Expect America’s new president to work closely with Egypt’s president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, and Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. Mr. Trump has embraced Mr. Netanyahu’s positions on Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and on abandoning the two-state solution. Instead of Americanizing the Middle East, Mr. Trump seems set on “Israelizing” America, stirring fear of Muslims and trying to wall out “the other.” Arabs, and Middle Easterners in general, should take one quick look and figure out how to be less dependent on the United States, and how to resolve their conflicts within their own, regional frameworks.
Finally, some good news. President Obama has assured us that the sun will rise tomorrow, regardless. And if the Trump presidency is as bad as I expect it to be — though not so bad that it demolishes democracy entirely — he can be voted out in four years. Meanwhile, fasten your seatbelts. It’s going to be a hell of a ride.  By  Carol Giacomo  A commitment to human rights has been a fundamental precept of NATO since the alliance was created a half century ago. You would not expect that a founding member would have to be reminded of that fact. Certainly not the United States, for all those years the leader of NATO and an inspirational embodiment of its core values. Yet this is where we find ourselves now, the day after Donald Trump won the presidency: In congratulating him on his victory, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany felt compelled to set conditions for cooperation. “Germany and America are connected by values of democracy, freedom and respect for the law and the dignity of man, independent of origin, skin color, religion, gender, sexual orientation or political views,” she said in a statement, adding: “I offer the next President of the United States close cooperation on the basis of these values.” Mr. Trump’s behavior during his campaign was antithetical to those values. He has threatened to ban Muslims from the United States, refuse refugees, deport 11 million undocumented workers and build a wall on the border with Mexico. He has disparaged African Americans, Mexican Americans, women and people with disabilities. Moreover, Mr. Trump has called into question America’s commitment to NATO and displayed a befuddling penchant for defending Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, who is waging war in eastern Ukraine and destabilizing other parts of Europe by supporting far-right groups. He received no pushback on Wednesday from Theresa May, the British prime minister, who simply congratulated Mr. Trump on his win. The two leaders’ reactions were further proof that, after Britain’s decision to leave the European Union, we will have to look to Mrs. Merkel not just to lead Europe but to replace America in leading NATO as well.  By  Gil Troy  “I am scared that if Ronald Reagan gets into office, we are going to see more of the Ku Klux Klan and a resurgence of the Nazi Party,” Coretta Scott King said in November, 1980. “I’m afraid things are going to blow sky high during this next term,” a nursing student said. He’s a “nitwit,” added a Democrat. “He’s shallow, superficial and frightening,” one of that year’s historic numbers of “undecideds” insisted. Ronald Reagan “seems not to relish complexity and subtlety,” the New York Times editorial endorsing President Jimmy Carter’s re-election proclaimed. “The problem is not a loose lip but the simple answer.”  While fearing what Reagan’s own running mate, George H.W. Bush, had dismissed as Reagan’s “voodoo economics” during their primary fight, the editorial board feared “voodoo diplomacy,” too. From coast to coast, half of a divided nation abhorred —  and underestimated — the president-elect. “The American people,“ Hamilton Jordan, a key Carter aide, said, "are not going to elect a 70-year-old, right-wing, ex-movie actor to be president.” Pollsters reported in 1980 that “More voters held negative attitudes toward each presidential candidate than in any campaign since polling began” — a record we just broke in 2016. The economic dislocation of galloping inflation and the energy crisis produced a nasty campaign. Feeling neglected by Washington, millions embraced Ronald Reagan’s populism. Despite the Democratic panic, Ronald Reagan left America richer and safer after two terms as president. Reagan defied expectations by turning toward the center. He acted as president of the United States, not president of the Republican Party. Reagan used the transition period to heal wounds while claiming a broad policy mandate, despite winning only 50.7 percent of the popular vote. He vowed to “rebuild a bipartisan base for American foreign policy.” His cabinet choices were so moderate that Pat Buchanan, the conservative flamethrower whose rhetorical bluster anticipated the advent of Donald Trump, lamented: “Where is the dash, color, and controversy — the customary concomitants of a Reagan campaign?” Just weeks into Reagan’s first term, conservatives were demanding that his aides had to “Let Reagan be Reagan,” meaning: stop being so reasonable. But in adjusting, in tempering, Reagan was being Reagan. He knew the Constitution limited presidential powers — and he faced a Democratic Congress led by the formidable speaker of the House Tip O’Neill to remind him further. Illustrating Richard Neustadt’s lesson that the power of the president is mostly “the power to persuade,” many of Reagan’s achievements were symbolic. Rather than shrinking government as he promised, for example, he only lowered the federal government’s growth rate. History is not destiny. And Reagan had both a lighter touch than Mr. Trump, and eight years’ experience as  governor of California. Still, history is full of shifts and surprises. Mr. Trump must be a healer and unite America, as he tried doing in his victory speech. If he fails, the checks and balances that sometimes help crusading ideologues become effective leaders can ultimately impose a necessary gridlock. When asked about conservatives’ frustration with him, Reagan kindly insisted it was only a “very few” critics. He said: “There are some people who think that you should, on principle, jump off the cliff with the flag flying if you can’t get everything you want.” Reagan recalled that “If I found when I was governor that I could not get 100 percent of what I asked for, I took 80 percent.” So far, Mr. Trump, the political amateur and sputtering demagogue, has lacked Reagan’s magnanimity or his flexibility. Can the reality-show star turned president-elect mimic the actor turned president?  By  James R. Jones  In 1968, there was a demand among voters for change, especially regarding Vietnam and foreign policy, and there was a backlash against some of the Great Society programs. Then, as now, the Democratic candidate was tied to the departing administration and hamstrung to differentiate a new set of policies. As a result, the Democratic presidential nominee, Hubert H. Humphrey, narrowly lost to the Republican, Richard M. Nixon, a candidate who was despised by a large percentage of the electorate. One positive outcome of that election was the first organized transition from the departing to incoming governments. President Lyndon B. Johnson always believed that, after an election, Democrats and Republicans should come together to do what’s right for the country. At the time, I was President Johnson’s appointments secretary, the position that has since evolved into the White House chief of staff. Right after the 1968 results came in, the president put me in charge of organizing a transition process, something that had never been done. “Nixon is an S.O.B., but he’s the only president we’ll have,” Johnson told me. “I want him and all of his team to be fully prepared to govern after the Inauguration at 12 noon on January 20.” A few days later, Johnson and Nixon met at the White House along with Nixon’s top advisers, including H. R. Haldeman and John Mitchell. There we mapped out a program in which all of the Johnson cabinet and major White House staff members would brief their incoming counterparts as often as was desired by the new administration. My charge was to work with Haldeman, who became my successor at the White House, to make sure these briefings occurred across the new administration and in a timely fashion. One surprise was that Nixon told me that Mitchell could speak for him in all matters if he was not available. Johnson would have never delegated such authority, but that was the difference in the management style of the two men. While a smooth transition was important to Johnson, he didn’t stop being president. He was issuing orders and making appointments right up to the morning of the Inauguration. In fact, the day before the Inauguration the president told me to find out how many vacancies existed on commissions and boards and find good people that he could nominate. He kept Nixon waiting in the Blue Room on Inauguration morning while he signed those nominations (which required Senate confirmation) and had them delivered to the Congress before noon. It is a positive sign that President Obama invited Donald J. Trump to meet at the White House two days after this most contentious election. Today transitions are much more institutional now than our first one in 1968. But this process can heal many wounds and start bringing our country closer together. That’s imperative if we want to make our government work for the people again. Back in 1968, Johnson and Nixon left the White House together, along with Senator Everett Dirksen and me. We jumped into the car and headed to the Capitol. Surprisingly, Nixon wanted only to discuss how disappointed he was to have lost Texas (Johnson’s home state) and how determined he was to win it in1972. I hope the ride to the Capitol next January will be more substantive on policy.  By  Sarah Jaffe  If anything has been made clear by the results of this election, it is that the political and pundit class have underestimated the degree of anger and pain in the United States, the degree to which “recovery” has been recovery for a few and stagnation and decline for many more. One exit poll has been haunting me since I saw it: The Reuters/Ipsos early exit poll found that 75 percent of respondents agreed “America needs a strong leader to take the country back from the rich and powerful.” Only slightly fewer agreed that “the American economy is rigged to advantage the rich and powerful,” and — perhaps the kicker — 68 percent believed that “traditional parties and politicians don’t care about people like me.” There’s a lot to unpack in those statements. They may conceal white resentment of the perceived advancement past them of black and Latino people. But they also reveal the sentiment that has been there since the 2008 financial crisis laid bare the lines of power in the country and the world — when, as the protest chant went, “Banks got bailed out, we got sold out.” The downward trends have been with us for decades: the divergence of productivity gains from workers’ incomes, the substitution of credit card debt for raises, the shift of good union jobs and family wages and pensions into low-wage service jobs, and the attendant slashing of the social safety net. But the past eight years sped all that up and made it impossible to ignore. If Donald J. Trump stood out to voters from the rest of the Republican Party, aside from a willingness to say directly the kinds of things usually carefully dogwhistled, it was in his rants about trade and his lack of interest in dismantling the remnants of the welfare state. For white Americans anxiously looking at their disappearing stability, Mr. Trump was a bomb they were willing to throw at a system they felt was failing them. He emotionally echoed their outrage and gave them a place to direct their anger, the age-old right-wing populist trick of refracting it both upward at elites and downward at minorities. Hillary Clinton’s campaign and the mainstream Democratic Party were woefully unprepared to greet this wave. When your response to a cry of “Make America Great Again!” is “America Is Already Great!” you’d better be sure that it feels true to a majority of voters. The results show that it did not. To be sure, Democrats had an uneasy line to walk, between maintaining continuity with a still-popular, twice-elected Barack Obama — a continuity that won Mrs. Clinton the Democratic primary — and reaching the people who wanted and needed change. But the party’s wholehearted backing of Mrs. Clinton was a colossal misreading of a moment when rage at the establishment (of both parties) was simmering everywhere. That rage should have been visible as Mr. Trump ran away with the Republican nomination process despite the opposition of that party’s grandees, and as Bernie Sanders pushed Mrs. Clinton much harder than anyone had expected a gray-haired socialist from Vermont to do. But Mrs. Clinton opened her arms to disaffected Republicans rather than wooing the disaffected within and around her own party. Most of the television ads she ran were more about painting Trump as a dangerous aberration, an outsider unfit for office, than pitching any plan of her own for change. Democrats failed to realize that for many Trump voters, that was exactly what they liked about him.  By  Will Wilkinson  It may not be an exaggeration to say that Donald Trump both knows and cares less about the details of public policy than anyone ever elected president of the United States. This just goes to show that “politics is not about policy,” as Robin Hanson, the futurist and social theorist, likes to say. Mr. Trump’s playbook against Hillary Clinton broke with the hard-won norms of liberal democracy, went back to demagogic, authoritarian political basics, and updated them for  the reality television, social media age. Politics is, at bottom, about factions vying and coordinating to choose leaders in whom to invest authority. Throughout the campaign, Mr. Trump displayed an uncanny and unnerving mastery of the primal politics of authority, and the game of legitimizing his own and delegitimizing his rivals’ claims to authority. In Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump drew a general election opponent pre-weakened by a decades-long Republican campaign of delegitimization. He took advantage of it with shameless audacity, making the most of our culture’s lingering sexism and the popular perception of Mrs. Clinton as a member of an arrogant and corrupt elite that believes it is above the law. But tearing down his opponents was only half of Trump’s equation. The pundits and pollsters so badly botched their predictions in no small part because they failed to grasp the intense, reality-distorting power of Donald Trump’s fame. But Mr. Trump seems to have an intuitive understanding that glamour, celebrity and gaudy wealth are key ingredients in majesty — which is inherently authoritative and underwrites its own claim to legitimacy. Trump’s self-branded personal jet was more than a convenient means of transportation for a very rich man. It was a purple silk, ermine-fringed cape, Air Force One in waiting, and he knew how to use it. The United States, the world’s first nation founded on principled opposition to the pre-Enlightenment politics of majesty and unified authority, has deep-seated norms of republican modesty and propriety. Casting those norms aside and banking heavily on the atavistic political appeal of majestic celebrity gave Mr. Trump an advantage few us were prepared to acknowledge, allowing him to attract the support of an unforeseen numbers of black, Hispanic and female voters, despite his campaign’s naked racism and his scandalously misogynistic and abusive personal history. Because Mr. Trump’s strategy was so indifferent to matters of policy substance, it is incredibly difficult to say what policies Mr. Trump will actually support in office. I don’t think we’ve ever known less about what an incoming president really wants to do with his power. But we do have a clear indication of how he’s likely to wield it. He will cleverly burnish his claim to authority and relentlessly and effectively discredit his opponents, inside and outside the Republican Party, with all the tools of an executive branch that has never been more powerful and less constrained by the constitutional system America’s founders designed specifically as an alternative to and a bulwark against unitary authority.  By  Lindy West  I got up on Election Day and burst into tears — not a genteel twin trickle but a great heaving burst, zero to firehose. Tears spattered the inside of my glasses, dripped from my lips, and left mascara-tinged rosettes blooming black in my cereal milk. “Honey,” my husband crooned to me. “Honey, it’s going to be O.K. The numbers are still good. It’s O.K.” But it wasn’t the numbers. I wasn’t sobbing because I was afraid Hillary Clinton was going to lose. That would come later. I was sobbing Tuesday morning because, as I poured my coffee, I’d caught a glimpse of a cable news interview with Mrs. Clinton just after she voted for herself in Chappaqua, N.Y. She seemed breathless, exhilarated, a little overwhelmed. Over her shoulder, Bill Clinton stared at his wife and beamed. My husband stares at me like that sometimes. It’s not just love — we expect husbands to love their wives — but something less traditional, more conditional and gendered. It’s professional respect. It’s pride. We’re accustomed to that pride flowing the other direction, from wife to husband, because men in our culture get to be more than just bodies, do more than just nurture. Men get to act and excel and climb and aspire and thrive and win and rule and be the audacious, hungry fulcrum of public life. It is normal for men to have ambition. It is normal for women to stand aside. I thought about Bill Clinton meeting Hillary Rodham at Yale in 1971, and how tenacious and intense she must have been even back then, how undeniable and potent. Mr. Clinton describes the moment in his memoir . “She conveyed a sense of strength and self-possession I had rarely seen in anyone, man or woman,“ he wrote. "She was in my face from the start.” He says he once told her , during those years, “I have met all the most gifted people in our generation and you’re the best.” And then I thought about Mr. Clinton rising steadily through his political career, on the track we have built for charismatic, competent white men. He must have known, every second, how good his wife was. Not just good, but “the best.” Better than everyone he’d ever met; better than him, even. And he watched her stand next to him and wait, and wait, and wait, underestimated and degraded and excoriated for wanting more out of life than cookies. And she didn’t quit! She swallowed slander and humiliation and irrational hatred for three decades and she didn’t quit, and here she was, just a hair’s breadth from the presidency of the United States — the first woman ever to be trusted with the rudder of the world. He must be so proud of her, I thought. It made me cry. I cried because I want my daughters to feel that blazing pride, that affirmation of their boundless capacity — not from their husbands, but from their world, from the atmosphere, from inviolable wells of certainty inside themselves. I cried because it’s not fair, and I’m so tired, and every woman I know is so tired. I cried because I don’t even know what it feels like to be taken seriously — not fully, not in that whole, unequivocal, confident way that’s native to handshakes between men. I cried because it does things to you to always come second. Whatever your personal opinion of the Clintons, as politicians or as human beings, that dynamic is real. We, as a culture, do not take women seriously on a profound level. We do not believe women. We do not trust women. We do not like women. I understand that many men cannot see it, and plenty more do not care. I know that many men will read this and laugh, or become defensive, or call me hysterical, or worse, and that’s fine. I am used to it. It doesn’t make me wrong. But maybe this election was the beginning of something new, I thought. Not the death of sexism, but the birth of a world in which women’s inferiority isn’t a given. That grain of hope glowed inside me until around dinner time on Tuesday, the final day of an election so openly misogynist that the question “Sexual assault: good or bad?” was credulously presented for debate. Today doesn’t feel real. It is indistinguishable from fresh, close grief. But if there’s one lesson we can take from Mrs. Clinton, politics aside — and even Donald Trump acknowledged it in the second debate — it’s the limitlessness of human endurance. Those of us who have been left in the cold by this apparent affirmation of a white supremacist patriarchy (and sorry, white women who voted for Mr. Trump, but your shelter is illusory) are tough. We have been weathering this hurricane wall of doubt and violence for so long, and now, more crystalline than ever, we have an enemy and a mandate. We have the smirking apotheosis of our oppression sliming, paw-first, toward our genitals. We have the popular vote. We have proof, in exit polls, that white women will pawn their humanity for the safety of white supremacy. We have abortion pills to stockpile and neighbors to protect and children to teach. We have the right woman to find. We have local elections in a year. The fact that we lost doesn’t make us wrong; the fact that they don’t believe in us doesn’t make us disappear.  By  Seth Grossman  A couple of years ago, I produced a reality-TV show called “Hollywood Hillbillies,” about a family from rural Georgia who, driven by the grandson’s newfound internet fame, moves west to make it in Hollywood. The show centered on the undeniable charisma of “Mema,” the foul-mouthed matriarch who spoke her mind and poked fun at the habits and attitudes of the Los Angeles elite. The show was part of a wave of “redneck reality” shows like “Swamp People,” “Duck Dynasty,” “Bayou Billionaires” and “Moonshiners” that presented a vision of white, rural America as the last authentic place on earth, the last place untarnished by the corruption and cynicism of the elites. “Hollywood Hillbillies” aired on the Reelz Network, a channel owned by a billionaire Republican donor Stanley Hubbard , who funded a pro-Trump “super” PAC after his preferred candidates lost the primaries. Designed as a harmless comedy, the show reveled in Mema’s provocative, off-color remarks, just as Donald J. Trump’s audience revels in his. But now I’m thinking more critically about what shows like this are selling. All of these shows have one thing in common: While trafficking in rural stereotypes, they celebrate wealth and business success — whether that business is crafting hick-hop music, catching alligators or designing duck calls. Ostensibly produced for middle America, they offer a population disenfranchised by globalization and the information economy a vision of rural ingenuity rewarded. Mr. Trump based his candidacy around this population. He spoke directly to voters raised on reality TV, addressing their fears and aspirations with blunt talk. He became their perfect celebrity champion, a rich white man, his image polished by years in a reality-TV boardroom, who validated their demographic anxiety. In an election season driven more by hatred of political opponents than enthusiasm for two deeply unpopular candidates, President-Elect Donald J. Trump hated best, and won. I am wondering today if the same embarrassment that prevents some of us from admitting that we watch “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” also kept Trump supporters from admitting to pollsters that they were voting for a man they knew the media considered a bigot. Two months ago, I started working on a new series, “Trumpigration,” a travel show about where to move if Donald Trump somehow got elected. That, too, was designed as a lighthearted comedy. Now, facing the prospect of four years of a Trump presidency, it’s beginning to feel like the last chance to change the channel.  By  Roberto Suro  If you are in shock over the election results, don’t blame Latinos. They favored Hillary Clinton by better than two to one, according to the exit polls. They did not turn out in big numbers to protest Donald J. Trump, but it probably would not have mattered. It turns out that Latinos were the election’s biggest losers and not just because Mr. Trump won the presidency after a long campaign of slinging threats and insults at them. The bitterest loss was dealt by the 59.5 million mostly white people who voted for Mr. Trump. That was a rejection by their own countrymen. According to the exit polls — a rough measure of turnout at best — Latinos accounted for 11 percent of the votes cast Tuesday the same as 2012. If those numbers hold, there was little or no Trump effect, and however much the number of Latino votes increased was just a result of demography. You may have been convinced that it would be otherwise. Years of reckless commentary, news stories and advocacy insisted that Latinos would be the great demographic firewall that would safeguard progressive politics with surging population numbers. But, the firewall only stands in a few states, and the biggest of them, California, New York and Texas, are already decided. Mr. Trump concentrated instead on the old industrial states where Latinos are a sparse presence. When he demonized Mexico and unauthorized immigrants, he gained more in the Electoral College by mobilizing white voters than he lost by alienating Latinos. The national exit polls show that Mrs. Clinton drew 65 percent of the Latino vote compared with 29 percent for Mr. Trump. That is a landslide by any measure, and it is about the same margin in the exit polls for 2008 (67 percent vs. 31 percent). The disappointment sets in when you compare the outcome to 2012. President Barack Obama took 71 percent of the Latino vote in the exit polls that year compared with 27 percent for Mitt Romney. Mr. Trump was supposed to be the bucket of cold water that aroused the sleeping giant, producing not only a stronger preference for the Democratic candidate but also, more important, a spike in turnout. In 2012, with immigration reform on the line, more than 12 million Latino voters stayed home, producing a turnout rate of 48 percent compared with 64 percent for whites and 67 percent for blacks. The much ballyhooed and chronicled “Trump Effect” was supposed to have produced a surge in naturalizations and voter registration over the past year, and news organizations were churning out stories about the “surge” in Latino voting even after the polls closed Tuesday. While more time and data is needed to get a full picture of Latino turnout this year, at first glance it appears Latino numbers were up, and perhaps significantly in some places, but that in fact the giant was barely stirred. Four million more Latinos were eligible to vote Tuesday than in 2012. So, no matter who was running and no matter how low the turnout, the number of Latino votes counted Tuesday was virtually certain to be higher than 2012. In fact, demographic growth alone would have guaranteed Mrs. Clinton an additional 1.3 million votes (about 1 percent of the total votes cast), even if turnout remained at the same dismal rate as 2012, and she got two-thirds of the Latino votes. In Colorado and Nevada, Latino voters surely helped keep the states blue, and under different scenarios those states could have served as the much-advertised Latino firewall. The one real bright spot for Latino Democrats Tuesday came with the election of Catherine Cortez Masto to the Senate in Nevada. That vote may illustrate what it takes to wake up the Latino electorate: a charismatic and qualified candidate, strong mediating institutions, in this case the hospitality workers’ unions in Las Vegas, and well-organized political operation like the one created by Senator Harry Reid, the retiring Democratic leader. Meanwhile, something may have happened in Texas that needs a closer look. Mr. Trump won handily, but only by a 9 percent margin. President Obama lost the state by nearly 16 points in 2012 and by almost 12 points in 2008. A lot of non-Latino newcomers have begun to change the political complexion of the state in recent years, and that formula — newcomers plus Latinos — is what flipped Colorado and Nevada in the past. Florida is the one place where Latinos might have been able to change the results of this election and didn’t. In the exit polls, Latinos accounted for 18 percent of the total vote compared with 17 in 2012, and the split was slightly more favorable to Mrs. Clinton than it was for President Obama four years ago. Mrs. Clinton’s vote tally was more than 200,000 higher than President Obama’s, but Mr. Trump’s was more than 400,000 higher than Mr. Romney’s. And therein lies the result that Latinos will have to live with for the next four years. In a state that has vividly benefited from immigration and trade, a state where Latinos have for the most part prospered and contributed to the prosperity of their neighbors, white voters mobilized to elect a candidate who would angrily erase everything Latinos represent. No one else suffered that kind of defeat on Tuesday.  By  Kevin M. Kruse  With so many predictions about this presidential campaign having turned out to be so very wrong, comparisons to the 1948 presidential race come naturally. In that election, virtually everyone predicted that the Republican Thomas Dewey would beat the “accidental president,” the Democrat, Harry Truman. Pollsters reinforced these assumptions. Elmer Roper announced that he was so sure Dewey would win that he wouldn’t even bother reporting poll results anymore. “My silence on this point can be construed as an indication that Mr. Dewey is still so clearly ahead that we might as well just listen to his inaugural address,” he said. George Gallup kept polling until mid-October, but then rested on those results, assuming the race was over. Pundits agreed. Newsweek surveyed 50 of the nation’s top political reporters in October; every single one said Dewey would win. Republicans and Democrats alike assumed the race was over. On election night, the conservative Chicago Tribune was so confident it called the race early, rushing out a banner headline that would soon be as famous as it was wrong: “Dewey Defeats Truman.” To the amazement of nearly everyone, Truman won by considerable margins. In the popular vote, he took 49.6 percent to Dewey’s 45.1 percent. In the Electoral College, he won 303 votes to Dewey’s 189. While the margins of this year’s election are narrower, the shock and confusion of pollsters and analysts seems just as pronounced. But comparisons between the Truman and Trump campaigns are not neatly drawn. Truman was an outspoken liberal, and he campaigned on preserving and expanding the accomplishments of the New Deal welfare state. He called for expansion of Social Security, more progressive forms of taxation, a higher minimum wage, and a new national system of health insurance. Truman also committed the Democratic Party, long dominated by Southern segregationists, to a new racial liberalism. Notably, he called on Congress to protect the voting rights of African-Americans. In foreign policy, Truman set America against the growing influence of the Soviet Union. In 1947, he announced the Truman Doctrine, which prompted economic aid to Europe through the Marshall Plan and military alliances through a new North Atlantic Treaty Organization. A year later, Truman challenged Soviet expansionism with the Berlin Airlift. Mr. Trump has rejected much of the substance of Truman’s campaign, but in many ways he reflected its style. Truman’s famous “whistle-stop campaign” took him to rural communities and small towns where working-class and middle-class whites felt neglected. In fiery speeches with blunt language, he singled out sources of blame. Truman went after the “do nothing” Republican Congress as a prominent foe, but also denounced an array of “special interests,” including “bloodsuckers who have offices on Wall Street.” Truman named these enemies and promised to “give ’em’ hell.” His crowds believed him and rallied to their candidate. On Election Day, he predicted there were would be “a lot of surprised pollsters.” There were. Though he had reason to gloat, Truman was gracious in victory. The day after the election, the Washington Post staff invited him to a “crow banquet.” All the newspaper pundits, radio commentators and pollsters who predicted his defeat would wear sackcloth and force down a main course of crow; the president, in white tie and tails, would be served roast turkey. Truman declined, saying he had “no desire to crow over anybody or to see anybody eat crow, figuratively or otherwise.” He added, “We should all get together now and make a country in which everybody can eat turkey whenever he pleases.” Mr. Trump is not a politician who operates by anyone else’s playbook, but perhaps in this small but important matter, he can take a lesson from history.  By  Maureen Sullivan  I have to admit it: I am loving it. As the results poured in for Donald J. Trump, I reveled in the Facebook friends who openly mourned the end of humanity. I felt gleeful in trolling the Twitter hashtag #HesNotMyPresident: “I’m laying in bed with tears streaming down my face, just thinking about the future of this country.” This was one of the biggest election upsets in history, so of course everyone is stunned. Me too. Switching among three cable news networks and several websites I wondered: Is he really going to take Florida so easily? Did they just call North Carolina for Trump? Can he possibly win Wisconsin? Pennsylvania? Yup. I rooted for Mitt Romney in 2012 and John McCain in 2008. I ran for the school board in Hoboken, N.J., and lost once before winning the following year. I know what it’s like to have your hopes puddle up on the floor like that dollop of election-night Haagen-Dazs that you dropped and you just don’t care to wipe up. What does it matter? All is lost. You want to announce on Twitter that you are in bed letting the tears stream down your face. I saw this result coming over the summer. In July, five police officers were ambushed in Dallas and three more were killed in Baton Rouge. In August, Colin Kaepernick, the San Francisco 49ers quarterback, sat out the national anthem. In September, an Islamic terrorist, masquerading as a fried chicken salesman in my hometown, Elizabeth, N.J., set off bombs in New York and New Jersey. Mrs. Clinton proclaimed: “I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police.” She put half of Trump’s supporters in that “basket of deplorables.” People I know were angry. They were tired of being told they were racist and bigoted as they went about the business of mowing their lawns, writing college tuition checks and working their jobs as cops, secretaries and teachers’ aides. They kept being told they needed to look inward, examine their sins and judge themselves guilty. They had not forgotten when Barack Obama was running for president in 2008 and his wife, Michelle, said, “For the first time in my adult lifetime, I’m really proud of my country…” So now we have President-Elect Donald Trump. I supported him because he promised to curb regulations, cut taxes and appoint constitutionalists to the Supreme Court. I supported him because Mrs. Clinton doesn’t have what it takes to turn around a stagnant economy or stand up to the special interests that block innovation. In his victory speech, Mr. Trump lifted a line from Abraham Lincoln and spoke of “binding wounds.” I wanted him to be gracious and kind in that moment, and he was. My 89-year-old mother is still appalled by my vote and tells me, with a laugh, that she’s moving to Ireland. And one of my disappointed female friends on Facebook — who, like me is white and college-educated — wrote, “Obama helped expose the deeply racist nature of our country. Trump exposes the anti-intellectual, sexist xenophobia.” But most of my friends, some of whom I suspect cast votes like mine, have stayed quiet. I guess it’s still not politically correct to admit that you are on the Trump train.  By  Viet Thanh Nguyen  Worst-case scenario in the next four years: fascism, a wall, mass deportations, the end of Obamacare, a Trump brand on the White House and either a trade war or an actual war with China (since war is the easiest diversion from domestic unhappiness). Best-case scenario: Ruth Bader Ginsburg refuses to retire or die, the Democratic Party finds a backbone, turns away from its fixation on the center and heeds the call for an economic revolt against the 1 percent, joined by Black Lives Matter, the Occupy movement, and resurgent feminism. Both scenarios could happen at the same time. The second scenario requires Democrats to put their status quo political model to rest. They already had a significant portion of the nonwhite minority vote locked up, but have lost too many working-class white people. Bernie Sanders might not have won over the wealthier whites who were voting with Trump against the seemingly rising tide of minorities, but he might have snared the white working class and some of the white middle class. Here’s the bright side, for those, like me, who are on the liberal-to-left spectrum. If Hillary Clinton had won, she would have run again in 2020, which could have meant four more years of Wall Street liberalism and fire-and-forget perpetual warfare, conducted by drones and Special Operations over the horizon. Now perhaps Elizabeth Warren will be the 2020 Democratic candidate — a white woman, a feminist, and someone more progressive than Clinton. But all this speaks largely about domestic electoral politics. The sickness of the American body politic remains untreated, and will remain untreated, or exacerbated, in a country run by clowns, conspirators, and collaborators. That sickness is imperialism. America is an imperial country, and its decay might now be showing. The power that has brought so much benefit to the country — for white people — is now faltering in its ability to provide those benefits to all white people. The empire’s best hope is to be more inclusive, demographically and economically, but that runs counter to the imperial impulse to hoard power and profit. Warren or someone like her might be better at extracting more social and economic justice for all Americans. But unless such a person finds a way to ease control from the financial-industrial complex, the prospects of halting our decline are weak. Empires rot from the inside even as emperors blame the barbarians.  By  Robert N. Stavins  Donald J. Trump once tweeted that “the concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing noncompetitive.” Twitter messages may not be clear signs of likely public policies, but Mr. Trump followed up during the campaign with his “America First Energy Plan,” which would rescind all of President Obama’s actions on climate change. The plan includes canceling United States participation in the Paris climate agreement and stopping all American funding of United Nations climate change programs. It also includes abandoning the Clean Power Plan, a mainstay of the Obama administration’s approach to achieving its emissions reduction target for carbon dioxide under the Paris agreement. What should we make of such campaign promises? Taking Mr. Trump at his word, he will surely seek to pull the country out of the Paris pact. But because the agreement has already come into force, under the rules, any party must wait three years before requesting to withdraw, followed by a one-year notice period. Those rules would seem to be mere technicalities. The incoming Trump administration simply can disregard America’s pledge to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 26 to 28 percent below the 2005 level by 2025. That is bad enough. But the big worry is what other key countries, including the world’s largest emitter, China, as well as India and Brazil, will do if the United States reneges on its pledge. The result could be that the Paris agreement unravels, taking it from the 97 percent of global emissions currently covered by the pact to little more than the European Union’s 10 percent share. In addition, Mr. Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency probably will stop work on regulations of methane emissions (a very potent greenhouse gas) from existing oil and gas operations. Undoing complex existing regulations, such as the Clean Power Plan, will be more difficult, but a reconstituted Supreme Court will probably help President Trump when that plan inevitably comes before the court. Also, the new president will most likely ask that the Keystone XL pipeline permit application be renewed — and facilitate other oil and gas pipelines around the country. On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump promised to “bring back” the coal industry by cutting environmental regulations. That may not be so easy. The decline of that industry and related employment has been caused by technological changes in mining, and competition from low-priced natural gas for electricity generation, not by environmental regulations. At the same time, Mr. Trump has pledged to promote fracking for oil and gas, but that would make natural gas even more economically attractive, and accelerate the elimination of coal-sector jobs. If he lives up to his campaign rhetoric, Mr. Trump may indeed be able to reverse course on climate change policy, increasing the threat to our planet, and in the process destroy much of the Obama legacy in this important realm. This will make the states even more important players on this critical issue.  By  Dani Rodrik  The real costs of a Donald J. Trump presidency will most likely come on the political rather than on the economic side. We are likely to see some rise in trade barriers and unilateral economic policies. But for all his bluster, I do not expect Mr. Trump to engage in indiscriminate protectionism. We live in a world of supply chains where imposing tariffs on Mexican or Chinese imports will raise costs of United States businesses and make it hard for them to compete. Mr. Trump is a businessman, and he will understand soon, if he does not now, the senselessness of blanket protectionism. We may have plenty of trade disputes with foreign countries. It’s useful to bear in mind here the example of the 1980s, when trade frictions with Japan and other leading exporters produced a slew of so-called new protectionist barriers such as voluntary export restraints. But these did very limited damage to the world economy. Before long, the world embarked on a further and more intense round of globalization. Furthermore, we have robust international institutions, like the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization, that did not exist in the interwar period. And the political lobbies in favor of an open economy (big business and banks) are stronger and retain considerable influence in Washington. So even though the 1930s parallel is on everyone’s mind, I do not think we are in for a collapse of the international economic order and a retreat into trade war. The real danger Mr. Trump poses is the undermining of our politics — the norms that sustain our liberal democracies. His campaign was based on a divisive politics of identity. Ideals of equity, equal rights, diversity and inclusion were submerged under the weight of a rhetoric that raised racial and ethnic tensions and inflamed passions against imagined enemies — Mexican immigrants, Chinese exporters, Muslim refugees. Illiberal democracy has been the bane of several nations around the world. Under Mr. Trump, the traditions in the United States of checks and balances and of rule of law will be tested seriously. The political danger will be greatly magnified by Mr. Trump’s likely economic failure. He comes into office as the putative leader of middle and lower classes who feel they have been left behind. He has raised their expectations in ways that he cannot meet. There is little chance that incomes at the middle and lower end of income distribution will receive a large boost under his policies. The manufacturing jobs that have left will not return no matter how tough Mr. Trump’s trade policies get. These jobs have disappeared for good, largely thanks to technological changes, and not trade. When the full scale of his economic disappointment sinks in sometime during his term, Mr. Trump may well react in the time-honored fashion of global populists like President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. To keep his base mobilized and insulate himself from economic troubles, he may take shelter in an intensified form of the identity politics that worked so well for him during the presidential campaign. This would rip American society further apart along racial and ethnic cleavages. The ugliness that characterized politics during the presidential campaign may be nothing compared with what may be yet to come.  By  Teresa Tritch  Financial markets regained their footing on Wednesday, as investors and traders apparently concluded that a Donald Trump presidency might not be so bad after all. Instead of focusing on how unprepared Mr. Trump is to be president, several traders quoted in the media talked about how deregulation from ending Obamacare and the Dodd-Frank financial reforms — two Republican goals — could lift stock prices for health care companies and banks. They took special solace in Mr. Trump’s promise to boost government spending on infrastructure and in the measured tones of his acceptance speech. Unfortunately, there is no escaping the overarching conclusion that Mr. Trump’s campaign promises, if carried out, would harm the economy. His proposed rollback of Dodd-Frank reforms would invite renewed recklessness. His opposition to Obamacare would renew and intensify households’ financial insecurity. His proposed tax cuts for the rich would exacerbate income inequality, while either blowing a hole in the deficit or requiring deep budget cuts. His stance on trade would impair international commerce and cooperation. His proposed deportation of immigrants would unleash a legal and humanitarian crisis. Even his popular call for more infrastructure spending is flawed. In and of itself, Mr. Trump’s pledge to borrow vast sums to spend on infrastructure would be a sensible move at this time of low interest rates. But vastly increased federal indebtedness in addition to his other harmful economic policies would be piling risk on top of risk. Risk-taking that crosses the line into recklessness can be immensely profitable in the short run, which is what many traders care most about. But it is no way to run an economy on which everyone else depends for long-term prosperity.  By  Emily Bazelon  Now it looks like a warning shot. When Justice Antonin Scalia died in February, Donald Trump was among the first to call for stonewalling President Obama’s choice to fill the seat. “It’s called delay, delay, delay,” he said at the opening of the Republican presidential debate on Feb. 13. Senator Harry Reid, the minority leader, countered that it would be “unprecedented in recent history” for the Supreme Court to go a year without a full complement of justices. But other Republicans, chief among them the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, agreed with Mr. Trump and Senator Ted Cruz: Justice Scalia’s seat should remain vacant until after the election. Undeterred (what else was he supposed to be?), President Obama nominated Merrick Garland, a seasoned judge praised in the past by Republicans like Senator Orrin Hatch. A debate ensued over historical facts, which seems quaintly polite in retrospect. Since 1900, had the Senate ever refused to confirm a nominee in a presidential election year as a result of the impending election? The answer was no (even if Mr. Cruz tried to argue, against the facts, that Justice Anthony Kennedy wasn’t confirmed in the election year of 1988.) The Republicans’ refusal to grant Judge Garland a hearing or schedule a vote was in fact unprecedented. It was a new kind of hardball. And it succeeded. For a blip in August, Republicans took a hit in the polls for  obstructing the Garland nomination. But the moment passed, blown away in the chaos and battle of the presidential election. Judge Garland slipped from view. The parties adapted to a new reality in which both expected either his postelection, pre-inauguration confirmation, or a new nominee chosen by the next president. When they assumed Hillary Clinton would win, Republicans including Senators John McCain of Arizona  and Richard Burr of North Carolina talked about blocking Democratic Supreme Court picks indefinitely. Both were re-elected Tuesday and will return to a Senate still controlled by the Republicans. It’s hard to see how any Republican paid a price for radically altering the norms for Supreme Court appointments. Mr. Trump helped point the way, and the voters rewarded him and those who followed. Choosing a justice in Antonin Scalia’s mold, as he has promised, will allow Mr. Trump to prove himself to the social conservatives for whom the court, and Roe v. Wade, are the defining issues. Under the current rules, Democrats could filibuster his choice, but if that happens, how long will those rules last? 
Mr. Trump’s election has already run over far stronger traditions and norms. Next comes the question of how many additional Supreme Court appointments will come his way. Ruth Bader Ginsburg is 83. Anthony Kennedy is 80. Stephen Breyer is 78. In Supreme Court terms, four years is a long time.  By  Peter Wehner  To say that Donald Trump’s victory was a shock may qualify as the understatement of the century. The polls were wrong. The experts were wrong. I was wrong. Almost everyone was wrong — including those in the Trump campaign who expected to lose. His victory wasn’t just a surprise; it was an event of gigantic dimensions, its radiating effects incalculable. Mr. Trump’s win ranks among the most unlikely and stunning elections in American history. Regardless of how the Trump presidency turns out, this race will be studied a century from now. For those of us who have been vehement critics of Mr. Trump, this is a rather challenging moment. Starting on Jan. 20, he will be the only president we have. He now has a democratic legitimacy we may regret but cannot deny, and there is such a thing as democratic grace. To those who are tempted only to rage and attack and lament what has occurred, a word of counsel to them, and to myself: We need to give Mr. Trump the chance to rise to the moment, as unlikely as we think that may be. At the same time, we can’t possibly erase the history of the last 17 months — the words he said, the things he did, the conspiracy theories he wove, the ignorance, volatility and cruelty he showed — and our concerns aren’t going to evaporate now that he’s about to be in charge of the nuclear triad that during the campaign he didn’t even know existed. I believed, and still believe, that he is a man with a disordered personality and authoritarian tendencies. My job is to give him a chance to prove me wrong; his job is to prove me wrong. Among my worries is that Mr. Trump’s victory will validate his style of politics, his serrated rhetoric. The way he mistreats people will be normalized. This election has brought us to dark places. Rather than this approach being repudiated it will, for many, become a model. “All the decent drapery of life is to be rudely torn off,” in the words of Edmund Burke. If the Trump campaign foreshadows his presidency, America under Trump will be fundamentally different than it has been — coarser, less temperate and civilized, more inward and resentful. The Republican Party will fundamentally change, from a conservative party to one that champions European-style ethnic nationalism. (The Democratic Party, whose members were certain Hillary Clinton would win, will be convulsed as it enters a period of intense recrimination.) A few hours after Mr. Trump was declared the winner, I received a note from a friend of mine, the distinguished Christian writer Philip Yancey, who told me, “I’m surprised and befuddled, but not scared, thanks to the checks-and-balances strength of American democracy. I tremble, though, to think what an unpredictable leader offers to a world in growing crisis.” He added, “Some say God moves in mysterious ways.  I say, God grants humans the freedom to move in even more mysterious ways.” What happened on Nov. 8th was a mystery that may lead to calamity. I hope to God it won’t.  By  Anna North  I spent the days leading up to the election in Pennsylvania talking to some young voters , 18, 19, 20 years old. They wore flowered Doc Martens, fake fur coats, earbuds dangling from one ear. Overwhelmingly, they were open and polite. They were smart. They were angry at a political system they felt ignored them, but they hoped for better days ahead. In January, Donald Trump will be their next president. Many of these young people supported Mr. Trump. Many did so reluctantly. One young Trump supporter told me that no one knows exactly what Mr. Trump will do in office. Another described hesitating while filling out his absentee ballot, wondering if he could vote for a man who had made abhorrent comments about women. But some voted for Mr. Trump enthusiastically. Those who supported Hillary Clinton were disgusted by Mr. Trump and what he stands for. Today, they’re dealing with a new reality they didn’t expect. I’m thinking of Bria Blackshear, a 20-year-old Temple University student who had waited more than an hour at her polling place in north Philadelphia. “Donald Trump doesn’t represent the ideals I would want for this country,” she said. I’m thinking of Brooke Renner, 18, also a Temple student, who was waiting in line for a second time. She’d given up earlier, but was back and willing to wait as long as it took to cast her vote for Mrs. Clinton. Otherwise, she said, “I’d feel personally responsible if Donald Trump wins.” I’m thinking of Sierra Taylor, a 19-year-old student at the Community College of Philadelphia, who said, “black people feel like our votes don’t matter.” I’m thinking of her friend Naiya Johnson, 22, who, when asked about her hopes for the next four years, said, “I hope we make it.” I’m also thinking of the young people I saw debating the issues that matter to them. Of the table full of young men at Bucks County Community College arguing about Mr. Trump when one, the quietest, spoke up to say, “Trump has no respect for women.” Of the young man, who, as his friend criticized Mrs. Clinton’s record as secretary of state, interjected that Mr. Trump is racist, sexist and xenophobic. They’d had the argument once before, they said. I hope they keep talking. I think they will. It’s a frightening time to grow up. But these young voters are clear-eyed about the shortcomings of government and optimistic enough to imagine a better world. They can make friends with people of different viewpoints, and, when it matters, they can challenge their friends to think in a new way.  By  Seamus McGraw  BRODHEADSVILLE, Pa. — Thinking back now, I can’t for the life of me figure out how I got it so wrong. He seemed so troubled by what he was about to do, as if he knew it was a mistake, but one he felt compelled to make. The way I read the pained look on his face, I thought he was almost apologizing; maybe seeking a kind of absolution. It was just a few days before the election, and I had been canvassing for the Democrats. I wasn’t out there because I was a particularly ardent Clinton supporter. She had certainly not been my first choice, my second or even my third. I’m one of those middle-aged white men without a college degree who had been holding out for Joe Biden to change his mind. But I felt as if I had an obligation to make certain that, at least in my little corner of Pennsylvania, a man who was, to my mind, so obviously unsuited to the highest office in the world, was not just defeated, but repudiated. I expected that my neighbors and friends and the strangers down the road would do just that. Sure, I could feel and even share their frustration over the fact that the longest postwar economic recovery had left so many of my neighbors behind. I had been left behind, too. And yes, I understood the fear of an uncertain world, and the stress of profound cultural changes that were upending so many things that my neighbors took as bedrock values. But I thought the character traits that had always defined the people I knew in eastern Pennsylvania — true conservatives with a sense of responsibility and decency — would in the end lead them to reject “Trumpism,” whatever that actually is. My job wasn’t to help Clinton win. I thought — or at least the pundits were telling me — that was a done deal. The way I saw it, my only task was to drive up her margins and to do that, I was working off a carefully curated list of likely Clinton voters thoughtfully provided to me by the local campaign office. And so when I knocked on this gentleman’s door on a back road in the rural, conservative West End of Monroe County, and he told me that he was indeed planning on voting for Donald Trump, I was ready to simply turn away. But he wouldn’t let me go. “I just can’t trust her,” he said. He made eye contact and kept it. Relentlessly. He and I were of the same rough demographic. Just like me, he was well into his 50s, with teeth that had seen better days. Just like me, he was lower middle class, judging from his surroundings. And as he rattled off a list of shopworn talking points — Benghazi, emails, pay for play — I felt as if I was hearing a stranger’s confession. I felt as if he wanted me to understand and forgive him for what he was about to do. I remember thinking to myself that when this was over, I was going to have to find a way to build a bridge back to this guy who was, in so many ways, just like me. Such was my arrogance. Late last night, as I watched Pennsylvania turn red for the first time in a generation, I kept thinking back to that man, and how I so misread his expression and his words. It wasn’t sorrow etched in his face. It was pity. For me. Because he knew, long before I did, how wrong I was.  —  Seamus McGraw is the author of “Betting the Farm on a Drought.”   By  Beverly Gage  In his victory speech last night, Donald J. Trump paid homage to “the forgotten men and women of our country,” vowing that they “will be forgotten no longer.” This essential political idea — that a vast segment of the nation’s white citizens have been overlooked, or looked down upon — has driven every major realignment in American politics since the New Deal. In 1932, at the darkest moment of the Great Depression, Franklin Roosevelt evoked the “forgotten man” as a reason to rebuild the economy from the “bottom up.” More than three decades later, after Richard Nixon’s 1968 victory, the journalist Peter Schrag identified the “Forgotten American” — the white “lower middle class” voter — as the key to the nation’s apparent rejection of the Great Society and the New Deal order. “In the guise of the working class — or the American yeoman or John Smith — he was once the hero of the civic books, the man that Andrew Jackson called ‘the bone and sinew of the country,’ ” Mr. Schrag wrote. “Now he is ‘the forgotten man,’ perhaps the most alienated person in America.” That this “forgotten” American could be used both to uphold and to dismantle liberalism suggests that this American political identity has never been especially fixed: Democrat or Republican, liberal or conservative, but populist above all. Since the 1960s, the phrase has also implied that the country was paying too much attention to the wrong sorts of people — most notably, to African-Americans — at the expense of the white working class.
It is no coincidence that the “forgotten men and women of our country” began their migration into the Republican Party at the very moment that African-Americans were asserting their right to vote, and voting Democratic, in large numbers for the first time. Mr. Trump’s victory will go down as one of the great upsets in United States history, but it is also the product of a long and bitter struggle over race and class in this country. The Yale sociologist William Graham Sumner is often credited with coining the term “forgotten man.” Writing near the dawn of the Progressive Era, he lamented the lost autonomy of hard-working citizens suddenly forced to pay for high-flown programs of social reform. Sumner’s most famous political essay, “What the Social Classes Owe to Each Other,” rejected the very idea that government might mitigate class antagonisms by sharing the social wealth. What did social classes owe to each other? Not much, in Sumner’s view. And his “forgotten man” owed the least of all. In his 1932 campaign for the presidency, Roosevelt sought to claim the term for a different and more expansive purpose. “These unhappy times call for the building of plans that rest upon the forgotten,” he said in a radio address from Albany in April 1932, for plans “that build from the bottom up and not from the top down, that put their faith once more in the forgotten man at the bottom of the economic pyramid.” To Roosevelt, the “forgotten man” encompassed the industrial worker and struggling farmer and Keynesian consumer — ordinary citizens without whom a modern economy would falter. He built the New Deal around this image, establishing the minimum wage, Social Security and the federal right to organize unions. Those reforms cemented the loyalty of the white working class to the Democratic Party for a generation. But the New Deal also “forgot” — or excluded — many people, including African-Americans. When the Great Society came along, Lyndon Johnson tried to make up for that by expanding federal programs serving the poor and by championing the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts. As the country started to “remember” its long-delayed promises of equality, however, the “forgotten American” began to emerge as term of exclusion and resistance to change. “There is hardly a language to describe him, or even a set of social statistics,” Mr. Schrag wrote in his August 1969 essay, “ The Forgotten American .” “Just names: racist-bigot-redneck-ethnic-Irish-Italian-Pole-Hunkie-Yahoo. The lower middle class. A blank.” As Mr. Schrag noted, all of that name-calling was part of the problem, a refusal on the part of liberal elites to recognize the real grievances and desires of what had once been a bedrock Democratic constituency. In the 1968 campaign, Nixon capitalized on this resentment with calls for “law and order,” a phrase that evoked not only fears of crime, but also anger at protesters and rioters and the college-campus liberals who tolerated them. Mr. Trump put that phrase back into political circulation in 2016, a gesture of solidarity with the old ways of thinking about the “silent majority” — and the “forgotten American.” And though he included “men and women” in his victory speech, Mr. Trump’s campaign mobilized around the same image that once animated the Roosevelt coalition: the “forgotten” white working-class man. Race, too, remains an indelible part of today’s conversation about who has been “forgotten” and who deserves to be seen. To dismiss this language as simple racism, however, is to miss at least some of its political significance. What happened in the late 1960s and 1970s was not only that the Republican Party reclaimed and redefined Roosevelt’s “forgotten man” for a more conservative age. During those years, the Democratic Party itself began to turn away from the New Deal and its working-class politics, especially from its commitment to organized labor. With Mr. Trump’s election, we may be witnessing the rise of a new party system, with the Democrats now the standard-bearers of racial tolerance and free-market globalization, and the Republicans the party of nationalist populist revolt. But as Roosevelt showed, this need not be a fixed political equation. If the 2016 election marks the final, gasping end of the New Deal coalition, it should also mark the start of a new reckoning within the Democratic Party.  By  Helen Lewis  LONDON — You can’t throw a peanut in a Westminster pub without hitting an obsessive follower of American politics. Start a conversation about “The West Wing” with any member of Parliament and expect to get a long disquisition on that American political drama’s best episodes. During Britain’s last general election, in 2015, both main political parties here proudly boasted about being advised by veterans of Barack Obama’s campaign. Until now, our Americophilia has been unrequited. Then in August, Donald J. Trump declared himself “Mr. Brexit.” For Mr. Trump and his supporters, Britain’s vote in June to leave the European Union was evidence of a growing popular revolt against multiculturalism, porous borders and political elites. If the British electorate could deliver a result that baffled its financial sector, its scientists and metropolitan liberals – and was not widely predicted by pollsters – couldn’t the same sort of upset happen in America? It just did. Mr. Trump’s victory feels like a flashback to June, although where Brexit divided members of Britain’s political class, the American election results have united them. Politicians of the mainstream right and left alike are dumbfounded that the United States  would elect someone who uses the extreme language Mr. Trump does and who seems to have little love for institutions like NATO. Last December, Britain’s former Conservative prime minister, David Cameron, described Mr. Trump’s proposed ban on Muslims entering America as “divisive, stupid and wrong.” The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan of the Labour Party, has called the president-elect’s views on Islam “ignorant.” Apart from Nigel Farage, the face of the far-right U.K. Independence Party, it is difficult to find a British politician with a good word to say about Mr. Trump. Nationalism, white anger and protectionism are now driving politics in Britain and across Europe. The sound is of doors slamming. Brexit felt like a referendum on border control, and on rapid demographic change among white communities that felt themselves deprived of attention and resources. It is tempting to draw comparisons with the United States: The big cities in both Britain and the United States, which are most diverse, are also most relaxed about that diversity. In smaller communities, immigration feels more disruptive. There are other parallels. Mr. Trump’s victory was driven by older, white voters, who were struggling but not destitute. He won white men without college degrees by a landslide. A typical Leave supporter has a similar demographic profile. Such voters are on the decline, as both Britain and the United States become more diverse and younger generations are better-educated, and more open to immigration and change. But as both the Brexit vote and Mr. Trump’s victory showed, they are far from a spent force.  By  Susan Chira  Women, as Hillary Clinton showed this morning , know how to absorb pain. And Mrs. Clinton has had plenty of practice about how to stand before the cameras after public humiliation. Clearly, she needed time to compose herself. She made no appearances overnight, instead calling Donald J. Trump to concede. But when she strode onstage in purple and gray, Bill Clinton behind her in a purple tie, her voice did not waver. Women seldom have the luxury of giving in to pain. Many have children or grandchildren or aging parents to tend, whether they themselves are sick or in emotional turmoil. So Mrs. Clinton faced her despondent campaign staff and her despondent half of the country and tried to rally them. She spoke most directly to young people, and to women and girls. She had hoped to stand before them as a symbol of all that women could achieve. Now she had to demonstrate once again what women can endure. “I’ve had successes and setbacks, sometimes really painful ones,” she told them. It was hard not to recall her standing beside Bill Clinton after the whole world knew graphic and humiliating details about the affairs he had denied having. “To all the women and especially the young women who put their faith in me I want you to know that nothing has made me prouder than to be your champion,” she said, and here she had to clear her throat. “I know we still have not shattered that highest and hardest glass ceiling but some day somebody will, and hopefully sooner than we might think right now.” It’s difficult to know right now all that stood in the way of shattering that ceiling. Was it a woman, or this woman? Was it Mrs. Clinton as symbol of the Washington establishment, as a consummate insider in a time of profound distrust of the elite? We do know that voters disproportionately punish women who are seen as dishonest. We do know that it’s hard for strong, assertive and ambitious women to be seen as likable and competent at the same time. Political scientists and cultural commentators will long debate what happened in this election, to this woman and to many women.  The question is whether the image of Mrs. Clinton, composed and gracious in defeat, persevering through pain, will inspire women to try again?  By  Felix Salmon  Markets always move after seismic events, like the unexpected election of Donald J. Trump. Still, market moves need to be interpreted. Even if you believe that markets are right, it’s not always obvious what they’re saying. One way to think about the market’s gyrations is the idea of mean and variation. When Barack Obama (a.k.a. No Drama Obama) was elected president, it was possible to anticipate — correctly, it turned out — that he would help steer America back onto a course of steady growth, low inflation and falling unemployment. Think of that as the Obama mean: the baseline expectation. When the stock market expects good things like that, it tends to rise, just as it has during the Obama presidency. But the variation is just as important as the mean. Mr. Obama didn’t always give the markets what they wanted, but by the same token he was always clear about what he was going to do. He promised them something much more valuable: a low-risk upward economic trajectory. Mr. Trump is the exact opposite of Mr. Obama. His baseline is worse, for starters: to establish expectations for his presidency, you have to factor in his hugely irresponsible fiscal policy, potential trade wars and maybe even reckless brinkmanship over repaying the national debt. Put those things together, and a severe recession becomes possible. But it gets even worse because Mr. Trump is by his nature highly unpredictable. However bad you think he’s going to be, it’s entirely possible that your prediction will turn out to be ridiculously optimistic. Mr. Trump has vastly more downside risk than Mr. Obama ever had, and so markets are going to trade at a discount to his already-discounted baseline. If you transition, then, from low-risk positive expectations to high-risk negative expectations, you have to expect the markets to take some precipitous plunges along the way. Much of that will be noise. The markets always fluctuate randomly in the short term, and there’s no point in trying to read anything meaningful into those moves. That’s why it’s dangerous to read too much into midnight stock-market futures trading, or a sudden plunge in the value of the Mexican peso once it becomes obvious that Mr. Trump will become president. Those moves might be a rational response to the lower expected value of the assets in question. On the other hand, they might just be the result of panicky hedging — or indeed they could simply represent dealers second-guessing and trying to outmaneuver one another. Once the market has been trading steadily for a few months, its general direction under the auspices of the new government is going to be pretty clear. Fluctuations over just a few hours, by contrast, are much harder to read. They might look like signals — but all too often they turn out to be nothing but noise. And as we’ve learned during this long, brutal election, separating noise from signals can be a very tricky business.  By  Michael Lerner  It turns out that shaming the supporters of Donald J. Trump is not a good political strategy. Though job loss and economic stagnation played a role in his victory, so did shame. As the principal investigator on a study of the middle class for the National Institute of Mental Health, I found that working people’s stress is often intensified by shame at their failure to “make it” in what they are taught is a meritocratic American economy. The right has been very successful at persuading working people that they are vulnerable not because they themselves have failed, but because of the selfishness of some other villain (African-Americans, feminists, immigrants, Muslims, Jews, liberals, progressives; the list keeps growing). Instead of challenging this ideology of shame, the left has buttressed it by blaming white people as a whole for slavery, genocide of the Native Americans and a host of other sins, as though whiteness itself was something about which people ought to be ashamed. The rage many white working-class people feel in response is rooted in the sense that once again, as has happened to them throughout their lives, they are being misunderstood. So please understand what is happening here. Many Trump supporters very legitimately feel that it is they who have been facing an unfair reality. The upper 20 percent of income earners, many of them quite liberal and rightly committed to the defense of minorities and immigrants, also believe in the economic meritocracy and their own right to have so much more than those who are less fortunate. So while they may be progressive on issues of discrimination against the obvious victims of racism and sexism, they are blind to their own class privilege and to the hidden injuries of class that are internalized by much of the country as self-blame. The right’s ability to portray liberals as elitists is further strengthened by the phobia toward religion that prevails in the left. Many religious people are drawn by the teachings of their tradition to humane values and caring about the oppressed. Yet they often find that liberal culture is hostile to religion of any sort, believing it is irrational and filled with hate. People on the left rarely open themselves to the possibility that there could be a spiritual crisis in society that plays a role in the lives of many who feel misunderstood and denigrated by the fancy intellectuals and radical activists. The left needs to stop ignoring people’s inner pain and fear. The racism, sexism and xenophobia used by Mr. Trump to advance his candidacy does not reveal an inherent malice in the majority of Americans. If the left could abandon all this shaming, it could rebuild its political base by helping Americans see that much of people’s suffering is rooted in the hidden injuries of class and in the spiritual crisis that the global competitive marketplace generates. Democrats need to become as conscious and articulate about the suffering caused by classism as we are about other forms of suffering. We need to reach out to Trump voters in a spirit of empathy and contrition. Only then can we help working people understand that they do not live in a meritocracy, that their intuition that the system is rigged is correct (but it is not by those whom they had been taught to blame) and that their pain and rage is legitimate."
"Syrian’s Defection Signals Eroding Support for Assad","Advertisement By NEIL MacFARQUHAR JULY 6, 2012  BEIRUT, Lebanon — The defection of a young general close to President Bashar al-Assad of Syria has provided the most telling sign yet of eroding support for his government among even the most elite and trusted Sunni Muslims, who serve as a critical pillar of the security forces and civilian administration. But while the defector, Brig. Gen. Manaf Tlass, gained world attention when he fled Damascus on Thursday, President Assad’s bigger military challenge is the swelling number of silent objectors — soldiers of all ranks lacking the means to flee, or the interest, but no longer cooperating with the government. Instead of responding to the call to duty, they are staying home, abandoning their posts as the opposition grows bolder, stronger and more effective, said Syrian military experts and defectors. Mr. Assad’s loyal inner circle and core support remains the Alawite community, a minority Muslim sect. But Alawites constitute no more than 12 percent of the 23 million population, so the Assad family has for decades relied on the majority Sunnis for their legitimacy and practical support. Sunnis make up the bulk of the nation’s foot soldiers, hold posts throughout the bureaucracy and dominate the elite in the business community. A few Sunnis have always held high-profile positions in the government and military. General Tlass’s father, Mustafa, like his son a Sunni, was a confidant of the president’s father, Hafez, and served as defense minister for 32 years under both men. Advertisement But the uprising fueled almost entirely by the Sunni community — some 75 percent of the population — has gradually formed a deepening sectarian rift, chipping away at that crucial support among Sunnis. As the government crackdown intensified, leaving by some estimates as many as 17,000 dead, according to the United Nations , at least one deputy minister and 15 generals, all of them Sunnis, have defected to Turkey , 5 in the past few weeks alone. Advertisement The numbers of those who are actively undermining the government by simply refusing to comply, rather than join the opposition, are far larger, however. The Syrian Army of roughly 400,000 troops has been more affected by this type of attrition than by defections, experts said. Of the 80,000 young men expected to show up for their mandatory military service this year — most of them Sunnis — experts said that virtually none have responded. The distrust between the Sunnis and Alawites in the military has grown so deep that at night, when Sunnis are put on guard duty at key installations, there are always Alawite guards assigned to watch the Sunni soldiers, said a colonel who defected to Turkey. “If there is any doubts about their loyalty they could be imprisoned or killed,” he said. “Many of my Sunni colleagues are in jail.” Many experts said that the government has tried to inoculate itself from over-reliance on the Sunni community and has long been planning for the very uprising it is now facing. As far back as the 1950s, Alawites already constituted 50 percent to 60 percent of the noncommissioned army officers, said Aram Nerguizian, an expert in Middle East military strategy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington . “There have been no meaningful defections from the Alawite community,” he said. Many officers who have defected tell the same story, of a military that relies largely on Alawites. During the officer training course at the military college, each class of about 1,200 men consisted of around 900 to 1,000 Alawites, about 100 Sunni Muslims, and roughly 100 others representing Syria’s patchwork of sects and ethnic minorities. “They made it this way so the army would not defect,” said a Sunni Muslim colonel with 25 years in the army, speaking in an interview just days after he reached the southern Turkish city of Antakya in June. He spoke anonymously to protect relatives left behind. In addition to the sect loyalty, the government has managed to slow the erosion of its support — and at least win the neutrality of those who choose to stay home. Even officers who do not report for duty still draw salaries and pensions in a broadly successful attempt to buy their acquiescence. Many officers, wary of possible foreign military intervention someday, choose to stay because they want to help prevent in Syria what happened in Iraq after the 2003 American invasion, when the army was disbanded and career military men were thrown out of work. Others stay because they see no credible alternative to Mr. Assad’s rule. Advertisement All government employees have had their salaries cut except army and intelligence officers, the Sunni colonel said. The colonel, his wife and three children fled southern Syria with basically the clothes on their backs, leaving behind a house, another car and what he said was $100,000 in his savings account, the kind of loss that has dissuaded others from following suit. “Eighty percent of the officers who want to defect are Sunnis,” he said. But Sunni troops and officers are regarded with distrust by their Alawite peers. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

General Tlass, with a rich businessman for a brother and a wealthy widowed sister in Paris , did not have to worry about financial repercussions and only moved when much of his immediate family was out of harm’s way, experts noted. “I don’t see this as a politically motivated defection, it is jumping off the sinking ship of the regime,” said Akil Hashem, a former Syrian tank commander now living in the United States . “I sense a weakening, but it is not the weakening we are looking for.” Out of fear of arming potential opponents, many ordinary units made up of Sunni conscripts are not deployed. Instead the government relies on heavily Alawite elite units and intelligence services to suppress the uprising. Estimates range for about 60,000 men together in the Republican Guards — where General Tlass served as a commander — and the Fourth Division, and another estimated 150,000 in the four main intelligence services. Eighty percent of such units are believed to be Alawite, as are many of the thuggish gangs, or Shabiha, who unleash violence on those opposing the government. “When the military gets new weapons like a new tank, it goes immediately to the Fourth Division and the Republican Guards,” Mr. Hashem said. “This is the main force the regime depends on to end the revolution. It is not likely to have defections in these units.” The only way to speed defections, he said, is to create a safe territorial zone within Syria where officers of any ethnicity can flee. But that was not a main part of the discussions on Friday in Paris, where foreign ministers representing 100 countries in the Friends of Syria group met with the opposition in the third of a series of meetings to address the crisis. Advertisement Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton called for increased pressure on Syria to move toward a transitional government, as well as for United Nations sanctions, which Russia and China have consistently blocked. Arab leaders called for going around the Security Council to aid the opposition. Mrs. Clinton also suggested greater international efforts to move China and Russia, Syria’s main international backers, to cease shielding Mr. Assad. Moscow later termed her comments “inappropriate.” In another Syria development, Ban Ki-moon , the United Nations secretary general, said in a report to the Security Council on Friday that the cease-fire monitoring mission in Syria, suspended three weeks ago because of unprecedented violence and physical danger to its members, should not be disbanded. Rather, he said, it should shift to other activities inside the country aimed at encouraging a political solution to the conflict. His report also said the 300-member mission should be consolidated in Damascus for safety reasons. The mandate for the mission expires July 20.

"Minsky and Methodology (Wonkish)","Steve Keen has a new post up (with a link to a new paper) about Minksyan (Minskyite?) economics, and how people like me get it wrong. Good for him; debates like this are always productive, and I wish domestic responsibilities weren’t keeping me from going to the Berlin conference. What I can do, however, is offer some brief notes on what puzzles me here, and why, I guess, I’ll never be a true Minskyite in Keen’s sense. So, first of all, my basic reaction to discussions about What Minsky Really Meant — and, similarly, to discussions about What Keynes Really Meant — is, I Don’t Care. I mean, intellectual history is a fine endeavor. But for working economists the reason to read old books is for insight, not authority; if something Keynes or Minsky said helps crystallize an idea in your mind — and there’s a lot of that in both mens’ writing — that’s really good, but if where you take the idea is very different from what the great man said somewhere else in his book, so what? This is economics, not Talmudic scholarship. And then the question is, how should one do economics? I wrote about this a long time ago . In that piece, written around 1991, I laid out some rules for research; for now, let me just focus on the search for simplicity. I always try to find the simplest representation I can of whatever story I’m trying to tell about the economy. The goal, in particular, is to identify which assumptions are really crucial — and in so doing to catch yourself when you’re making implicit assumptions that can’t stand clear scrutiny. Keen doesn’t seem to be doing that. His paper contains a number of assertions about what is crucial, without much explanation of why these things are crucial. And I guess I just don’t see it. In particular, he asserts that putting banks in the story is essential. Now, I’m all for including the banking sector in stories where it’s relevant; but why is it so crucial to a story about debt and leverage? Keen says that it’s because once you include banks, lending increases the money supply. OK, but why does that matter? He seems to assume that aggregate demand can’t increase unless the money supply rises, but that’s only true if the velocity of money is fixed; so have we suddenly become strict monetarists while I wasn’t looking? In the kind of model Gauti and I use, lending very much can and does increase aggregate demand, so what is the problem? Keen then goes on to assert that lending is, by definition (at least as I understand it), an addition to aggregate demand. I guess I don’t get that at all. If I decide to cut back on my spending and stash the funds in a bank, which lends them out to someone else, this doesn’t have to represent a net increase in demand. Yes, in some (many) cases lending is associated with higher demand, because resources are being transferred to people with a higher propensity to spend; but Keen seems to be saying something else, and I’m not sure what. I think it has something to do with the notion that creating money = creating demand, but again that isn’t right in any model I understand. My point is that there seems to be a lot of implicit theorizing going on here — and at least at first glance, the implicit theorizing doesn’t make a lot of sense. I could be wrong, but that’s the whole point of simple models: to lay bare what you’re assuming, and make it clear what, specifically, is driving your conclusions. I hope someone in Berlin presses Keen on all this. Paul Krugman is an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times. Advertisement"
"Disco-era Macroeconomics","There was another sad thing in that Holtz-Eakin piece calling me an orthodoxy all by myself; it was really disappointing to see DHE pulling the old âKeynesian policies caused stagflation” line. Needless to say, I get this all the time. But it usually comes from people who have some excuse for not knowing either what Keynesianism means or what actually happened in the 70s. So, what people like me have been calling for is a temporarily relaxed attitude toward deficits as long as the economy remains depressed and monetary policy is up against the zero lower bound. What does that have to do with the 70s? Well, here’s the ratio of debt to GDP: So, as you can see, during the 70s we had deficit spending that ran up the national debt, until Ronald Reagan was elected in 1980 and restored fiscal soundness. Oh, wait; it’s actually the opposite. The truth is that whatever you might say about economic policy in the 1970s, it had nothing to do with Keynesian fiscal policy — and did not involve increasing debt. People on the right tend to use “Keynesian” to mean “liberal stuff I don’t like”, but aside from that definition, the 70s tell us nothing about the issues we’re discussing right now. You can argue that monetary policy was too loose, that the Fed was too expansionary in 1972 (when Arthur Burns was trying to reelect Richard Nixon) and that it failed to tighten in the face of oil-shock-driven inflation. But again, the idea that this experience has any relevance to expansionary fiscal policy in the face of a liquidity trap is totally bogus. But I guess I should have expected this; after all, it’s also standard to argue that the troubles of the 70s somehow proved that the welfare state is the root of all economic evil, which makes equally little sense. The 70s were important for economics. They did kill the notion of a stable Phillips curve that doesn’t depend on expected inflation, and convinced Keynesian as well as non-Keynesian economists that there is a minimum level of unemployment that can’t be reduced with demand-side policies (although we learned that lesson too well; recent experience shows that there is a lot of nominal stickiness at low inflation rates). But the 70s as a cautionary tale showing that liberals are always wrong is just dumb and/or dishonest. Paul Krugman is an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times. Advertisement"
"Tessa Jowell gets standing ovation in Lords after moving cancer speech – as it happened","Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happen  Thu 25 Jan 2018 21.01 GMT    First published on Thu 25 Jan 2018 09.12 GMT      5.59pm GMT  17:59   1) For months the Government has dodged the question of what their desired Brexit end-state is. Internal discussions have considered both a so-called "EEA minus" or "CETA plus" model but publicly the PM has insisted that she wants a bespoke deal - unlike Canada or Norway That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Updated at 9.01pm GMT    5.36pm GMT  17:36   Earlier I flagged up Gary Gibbons ’ Channel 4 News blog about the draft of new EU guidelines for the Brexit transition he has seen. He has posted them in full on his blog. Here is some Twitter comment on them. From the Sun’s Nick Gutteridge Just look at that difference between Para 18 of the draft transition guidelines, published on Dec 20, and the ones agreed by ambassadors yesterday. Not going to help the blood pressure of those MPs already furious about us becoming a 'vassal state' for (at least) 2 years. pic.twitter.com/Qjt6QqxbrY Here are the EU guidelines from 20 December (pdf) Gutteridge is referring to. From Peter Ricketts, a former head of the Foreign Office Here’s what the EU means by a transition deal. As expected: UK not at the table, but bound by all the EU’s rules, including any that come into force during the transition. Not comfortable, but I expect we will settle for something close to this. https://t.co/fcwOM82iWI From Charles Grant, director of the Centre for European Research I have just told Gary of @Channel4News that the UK will have to accept the transition on the EU's terms. The UK - and its businesses - need the transition. But it may turn out to be 3-5 years long, rather than 2, IMHO. @CER_EU  https://t.co/xFyd6IR2qE From Nicolai von Ondarza, a researcher at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs Negotiation mandate leaked on transition: As expected, EU27 goes full monty on demands to turn UK into rule taker with no representation, no votes but fully bound by EU legal framework, incl full membership of single market and customs union. #brexit  https://t.co/EaLG9pd7Rc   5.12pm GMT  17:12   Here are extracts from Tessa Jowell ’s speech. Her brain cancer is very serious, the Lords was packed for her speech and peers listened to her in silence and with great respect. Afterwards (very unusually for parliament, where applause is not meant to be allowed) she was given a long standing ovation. For what would every cancer patient want? To know that the best, the latest science was being used - wherever in the world it was developed, whoever began it. What else do they want? They need to know they have a community around them – supporting and caring. Being practical and kind. For while doctors look at the big picture, we can all be a part of the human-sized picture. Seamus Heaney’s last words were: Noli timere,  do not be afraid. I am not afraid, but I am fearful that this new and important approach may be put into the ‘too difficult’ box. But I also have such great hope. So many cancer patients collaborate and support each other every day. They create that community of love and determination wherever they find each other. All we now ask is that doctors and health systems learn to do the same. Learn from each other. In the end, what gives a life meaning is not only how it is lived, but how it draws to a close. I hope this debate will give hope to other cancer patients like me. So that we can live well with cancer, not just be dying of it. All of us. For longer. Cancer is a tough challenge to all health systems, and particularly to our cherished NHS. We have the worst cancer survival rate in Western Europe. Partly because diagnosis is too slow. Brain tumours grow very quickly. And they are hard to spot. However, there is reason for hope. It is called the Eliminate Cancer Initiative (“ECI” for short). Its director is Professor Ronald de Pinho, from the MD Anderson Cancer Centre in Houston, Texas. ECI is a global mix of programme and campaign, already underway in Australia. It is designed to be rolled out next in the UK, the USA and China. This recognises that no one nation can solve the problem of GBM [glioblastoma multiformeon - the brain tumour Jowell has] on its own. ECI aims to do three main things: First, link patients and doctors across the world through a clinical trials network. Secondly, speed up the use of adaptive trials And thirdly, build a global data base to improve research and patient care. Usually, drug trials test only one drug at a time, take years, and cost a fortune. New adaptive trials can test many treatments at the same time. They speed up the process and save a lot of money. ECI also has a secure cloud platform where doctors can share data and insights. So much data is held in siloes with limited access. That reduces its value. This is all a quite new approach. Already, collaborative discussions are underway in England. Let me tell you what happened to me. On 24 May last year, I was on my way to talk about new Sure Start projects in East London. I got into a taxi but couldn’t speak. I had two powerful seizures. I was taken to hospital. Two days later, I was told that I had a brain tumour, glioblastoma multiforme, or GBM. A week later the tumour was removed by an outstanding surgeon at the National Hospital in Queen Square. I then had the standard treatment of radio- and chemotherapy. To put it in context, across the country, GBM strikes less than 3,000 people in England every year. It generally has a very poor prognosis. A major factor in survival is successful surgery. The gold standard is to use a dye to enable the surgeon identify the tumour. But it is only available in about half of the brain surgery centres in England. It must be extended to all of them. Updated at 5.17pm GMT    4.39pm GMT  16:39   Tessa Jowell, the Labour former culture secretary who has brain cancer, is speaking in the House of Lords now about her condition, and her call for patients to have better access to experimental treatments. She spoke about this in an interview for the BBC broadcast yesterday and now she is elaborating on what she said when speaking to Nick Robinson. The Lords is packed for the speech. There is a live feed here. Updated at 4.41pm GMT    4.29pm GMT  16:29   Downing Street has just put out a read-out of Theresa May’s meeting with Donald Trump. It confirms that Trump will be visiting the UK later this year. A Downing Street spokesperson said: Prime Minister Theresa May today met with President Trump at the World Economic Forum in Davos. The two leaders began by discussing Bombardier, with the PM reiterating the importance of the company’s jobs in Northern Ireland. The PM and the President discussed Iran, and the need to work together to combat the destabilising activity which it is conducting in the region, including ballistic missile development, and continuing efforts to ensure Iran does not develop nuclear weapons. They also agreed on the importance of continuing to stand side-by-side in the fight against Daesh in Syria and elsewhere. The prime minister updated the president on the good progress which had been made in the Brexit negotiations so far. The two leaders reiterated their desire for a strong trading relationship post-Brexit, which would be in the interests of both countries. The PM and president concluded by asking officials to work together on finalising the details of a visit by the president to the UK later this year.   4.03pm GMT  16:03   More evidence that the Brexiter push-back is now on: in a blog , Sky’s Faisal Islam s ays Brexiter Tories are gearing up to rebel on the taxation (cross border trade) bill because they fear it could become an instrument for effectively keeping the UK in the customs union. As he says, this would be “the first time leave-backing Tories will have rebelled on Brexit legislation.”   3.50pm GMT  15:50   One of the surprising features about Brexit last year was how much the Tory Brexiters were willing to tolerate as Theresa May unveiled details of what she was accepting in the negotiations. A two-year transition that some of them thought was unnecessary? No one minded at all. Payments of up to £40bn to the EU for the “divorce bill”? The Brexiters swallowed that too with very little protest. The European court of justice having some ongoing role in relation to the rights of EU nationals? They did not mind much about that. Even the inclusion of full regulatory alignment as a fall-back position for Ireland did not trigger much of a protest. It seemed as if the Brexiters felt almost any transition concession was worth putting up with for the sake of ensuring that the UK actually leaves. They still worry about Brexit being reversed, but they think that once the UK has quit the EU on 29 March 2019, people will never vote to go back in. But Theresa May could be about to discover that she has reached the point where the Brexiter push-back begins. As the Telegraph’s Christopher Hope reports, Jacob Rees-Mogg, the prominent leave campaign who now chairs the European Research Group (ERG), the Tory MPs pushing for a hard Brexit, says government Brexit policy needs to “fundamentally change”. NEW Jacob Rees-Mogg: "The government's tone on Brexit needs to fundamentally change. If [Brexit's opportunities are] taken off the table then Brexit becomes only a damage limitation exercise. The British people did not vote for that. They didn't vote for management of decline." NEW Rees-Mogg: "If we are timid and cowering and terrified of the future, then our children will judge us in the balance and find us wanting. ‘Mene, Mene, Tekel, Upharsin’ – as the writing on the wall said at the feast of Balthazar. We have our future and destiny in our hands." Rees-Mogg: "There is a great Brexit opportunity and some really obvious benefits that we can get that improve the condition of the people. This is ... at risk. The negotiations ... sound as if they aim to keep us in a similar system to the Single Market and the Customs Union." Rees-Mogg: "The Customs Union is worse. It protects industries that we often do not have and helps continental producers on the back of UK consumers. The EU-funded CBI, that lover of vested interests, wants it to favour inefficient encumbrance against poor consumers." NEW Rees-Mogg: Whether it is ‘a’ or ‘the’ Customs Union it is a protectionist racket that damages the interests of the wider economy." Rees-Mogg may have been promoted to speak out by the experience of listening to David Davis, the Brexit secretary, at the Commons Brexit committee yesterday. Rees-Mogg said Davis’s proposals would turn the UK into a “vassal state”. Here is the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg on Rees-Mogg’s intervention. 2. Backbench Brexiteers getting their say before David Davis makes his speech on transition tomorrow - think what you like about Rees Mogg but as head of the ERG group he has a lot of sway, and ministers know he is popular with Tory grassroots Christopher Hope says it amounts to “a declaration of war” by 60-odd Tories. BIG MOMENT KLAXON This is effectively a declaration of war by at least 60 Eurosceptic backbench Conservative MPs on Theresa May and her team at 10 Downing Street over the Brexit talks. https://t.co/3MPlkZjDh7 The “60 Eurosceptic MPs’ is a reference to the ERG, although it is not clear whether the ERG is quite as powerful or united now as it used to be. When it was headed by Steve Baker during the EU referendum campaign it was very well organised, and it tended to get what it wanted. When Suella Fernandes was in charge it did not seem quite as influential. Rees-Mogg, who has recently replaced her as ERG chair, has a very high media profile, but may not have Baker’s skills as a backroom fixer. Updated at 3.56pm GMT    3.11pm GMT  15:11   Richard Adams David Meller , the Presidents Club co-chairman who resigned as a Department for Education director yesterday after the revelations about sexual harassment at the club’s charity dinner, has now taken leave of absence from his own trust, the Meller Educational Trust, which runs several schools. In a statement it said: The trust is absolutely committed to equality of opportunity and respect for all members of society. We are appalled to hear reports of what happened at the Presidents Club dinner. We, as trustees, wish to express our sympathy to those women who have been so badly treated. David Meller is taking leave of absence as a trustee with immediate effect. The trustees will continue to support the academies within the trust. To make things worse, Meller’s eponymous multi-academy trust had miserable results in today’s DfE league tables, with pupil progress “well below the national average”.   2.47pm GMT  14:47   In an article for the New European,  David Miliband , the Labour former foreign secretary who now runs the International Rescue Committee, says opposition will have to choose later this year between backing a Tory Brexit and calling for a second referendum. Here’s an extract. The transitional period, while necessary, offers false comfort. It delays the choices but does not remove them. Slow Brexit does not mean soft Brexit ... Labour needs to prepare for a life-changing question next autumn: will it vote to give a license for a Conservative Brexit, or will it insist that the voters be given a final say on the Brexit deal? Leave, and we take our chances on the choppy, laissez-faire open seas. Far from freeing ourselves to intervene, subsidise and reform, we will neuter our ability to do so. To govern is to choose, but opposition takes choices too, when it aspires to govern. The debate, or lack of it, about Article 50 last year provides a telling warning.   1.55pm GMT  13:55   In the Sun today  Harry Coles claims Sir Graham Brady , chair of the Conservative backbench 1922 committee, has asked colleagues not to submit any more formal letters demanding a leadership contest - prompting speculation that he has already received close to 48, the number that would trigger a no confidence vote in Theresa May. Cole says: One senior backbencher told The Sun the top Tory was “ashen faced” at the prospect of getting one more letter recently – which he has intimated could spark a bitter leadership election and plunge Brexit talks into chaos. The party grandee’s terrified reaction suggests the number of letters he has already received may now have reached the mid 40s, as anger with “dull, dull, dull” Theresa May spirals on the Tory benches. Brady does not speak about letters sent to him in confidence, and so it is hard to know where this will end up. But these tweets from the Evening Standard’s Joe Murphy will help to fuel speculation about May facing a leadership challenge at some point sooner rather than later. #KLAXON I hear two Tory MPs have indicated to collegaues they will be writing letters to Sir Graham Brady this weekend. Although a confidence vote is not thought imminent, a Tory says the local elections will the "maximum danger point" for Theresa May   1.34pm GMT  13:34   We do need to look at getting additional resources for our armed forces so they have the capability to protect and truly defend Britain’s global interests - both near and far. Williamson spoke out as his predecessor, Sir Michael Fallon , used an article in the Daily Telegraph to say defence spending should rise from 2% of GDP to 2.5%. The subject came up when a guest at the breakfast asked Mr Carney what the “delta” of voting to leave the EU had been so far. In economics, a delta is a ratio used to measure the difference between actual and potential growth. The guest requested that he measure it in “ Brexit buses”, a reference to the £350 million a week that Boris Johnson and the Leave campaign claimed the UK could recover by scrapping budget contributions to Brussels. According to a number of business figures at the event, the governor did some quick mental arithmetic and concurred that the missed opportunity equated to between two thirds and three quarters of the £350 million ... The £200 million figure is not directly comparable to the Leave campaign’s £350 million because the former refers to lost growth while the latter was money available for government spending. The £10 billion of lost growth equates to 0.5 per cent of GDP and the impact on the public finances would be considerably smaller. In a statement issued by Open Britain, the Labour MP Wes Streeting said: These comments by the governor of the Bank of England reveal the truth: there is no Brexit dividend, only a Brexit deficit. Brexit is already costing this country hundreds of millions of pounds a week, which means less money for public services and less money for the NHS during a winter crisis when it needs it most."
"A Conversation With: Shoma Chaudhury","You have been a big critic of the state of journalism in India. How do things look to you now? That is a vast question. I think there was a time about, say, two years back, when it was very easy to critique Indian media because their concerns and preoccupations were so visibly just those of the elite and the privileged of India. The entire preoccupation was the seduction of liberalized India, high GDP, and everything emanating from that. There was a kind of jingoistic nationalism to media coverage. I think the basis of journalism is really a search for equity and justice. Over the last two years, I think just physical circumstance has forced the media to revise its preoccupations. Now you will see issues of land, mining, peopleâs rights, forest rights, Lokpal, corruption, misuse of power, all of that is back in the mainstream, it is the big discussion. What I feel is still extremely problematic is the lack of perspective and proportion and complexity. Even when you are discussing these really important issues it is done in extremely shrill and disproportionate ways. Electronic media today is impacting governance and politics so hugely, it is changing the tonality of our public life. What is a recent issue that you think was dealt with in this sort of shrill way? Again it is a complex position. I believe that trial by media is quite important in India, largely because many justice systems are fairly derelict in the country. There are lots of times when justice can get waylaid because of empirical evidence not being there. Take Gujarat, for example. So it is important to fight some issues at a level of public perception. So I am not really opposed to media trials, but I think there is often a lack of proportion and complexity in the framework of discussion. The Aarushi Talwar murder is an example of where it can go badly wrong. The Maoist crisis is another. Even in two very high-profile issues recently — the 2G scam and Jan Lokpal movement — the media was not doing the due diligence all of the time. Quite often it was just touting what interested parties were saying. What you suggest might improve the quality of journalism in India? Speaking from our own experience, Tehelkaâs understanding of journalism got refined along the way. When the government had gone after us (after a 2001 investigation into bribe-taking in the Ministry of Defence), there was a huge amount of propaganda unleashed against Tehelka — and a really disheartening and learning experience was the way I would say almost 80 percent of the media was mouthing that propaganda and perpetuating that without doing any due diligence. I remember then it got really crystallised for us that fair journalism has to be not just about reporting what contending parties are saying but about ascertaining the facts. It is not just about the idea of neutrality that we are taught in journalism schools. I think today if I were to really enunciate what we do at Tehelka â in this context — it is to speak to everyone involved, be fair, but also to certainly ascertain where we believe the truth lies, go deeper and put our moral weight behind that version of the story. Not just report âHe said, âShe saidâ. You must do the extra work it takes to take positions on a story, to say, hereâs where we stand on this issue, hereâs who we believe is telling the truth. To think about a story rather than just be a stenographer of reality. What do you do in that kind of circumstance where you do get it wrong? Have you? Touch wood, we have been fortunate that so far we havenât been wrong on any major story. Of course there have been occasions when weâve had to put out some corrections on a story, where maybe a reporter got a fact wrong or just got a tonality on something wrong. But I would say in an 11-year span, while the scope for mistakes is always there, so far we havenât got it wrong on any major issue. I think there are times when news channels get carried away with the sheer urgency of their coverage and make mistakes and are not held accountable for it. Maybe itâs the hazard of the medium. The reporting on terror attacks has been like that. Quite often, dozens of innocent Muslim men have been called âterror mastermindsâ. Their lives are ruined. It may be proved wrong later but thereâs no retraction. In a different way, another example is the Lokpal Bil. Team Anna was insisting it had to be their bill and nothing else. Some TV channels supported that unconditionally without assessing whether the bill was a rational demand. Of course the government handled it all terribly. But the electronic media went a long way in polarising the debate unproductively. Journalists in India, especially from the major dailies here, will often know so much more about a major story than what gets published. Are there any pressures on Tehelka to not touch certain areas or industries? Secondly, what would your advice be to those journalists? No, there is no pressure here not to touch certain areas or industries. But it is a tricky question even for us. In a sense, Tehelkaâs history freed it up. The first 10 years, which were the hardest years, we actually never felt constrained to modulate any story. Tarun Tejpal used a great deal of ingenuity and will to keep us afloat and do the journalism we wanted to do. But it was a very difficult and a very corrosive ride. Part of Tehelkaâs battle was very glorious, it was fought in public eye, it was fought for the big ideals of journalism and all of that. But the downside of that was a constant battle for and search for money. Ten years later, as we struggle to create a robust institution that will have the same ideals yet last the course, I can better understand what other editors struggle with. Here still the management above me is Tarun, who is himself a journalist and does not come from a corporate or business mindset and does not have the sort of vested interests many editors have to face. So I would say in Tehelka it is still an extremely pristine landscape but not always as pristine as we want it to be. Our big learning has been â you pick your battles. You canât fight every battle that comes your way, and at Tehelka we sure fight enough. But along the way we have learned to not go in for pin pricks so that we can be there for the big fight. And the big fight is not even always just about the exposes, but to actually keep alive a mainstream journalistic space that bats for social justice, where one can write a 14-page story on Indiaâs coastal crisis or a tribal family or Bt Brinjal even though it makes no commercial sense to do so. Beyond a point though, I think it is pointless to talk about what individual editors manage or donât manage, what proprietors manage or donât manage. The problems of India media â and media globally â are really deep structural issues. We have to free media up from dependence on corporates. Create endowments and trusts. Rationalise pricing and distribution costs. That should be the key debate. Itâs a huge challenge. Till then, no matter how idealistic any journalist or even proprietor is, there will always be some hurdles you canât cross. And journalists might grumble about it endlessly but, honestly speaking, many of those who grumble the most would be the first to jump ship if salaries came late. You recently came under criticism, much of it from journalists, over the location of your Goa Think Fest. We’ve read your rebuttal to this criticism – was this a case where you decided not to go for a ‘pin prick’ story in order to better secure the long-term future of Tehelka? Absolutely not. As I said in the rebuttal, the idea that we held back a Goa mining story to facilitate our Think Fest was a malicious and baseless controversy. The exact opposite is true. The reporter wasasked to do a strong investigative story on Goa mining. Despite weeks of work, his story was weak and did not measure up. Far from being asked to kill the story, he was asked to go back to it a second time. It still did not measure up. After spending both money and time on it, the only reason we held the story is because it did not make the cut. It was not a story that Tehelka could bill as an expose. If the story had been done by him the way we had envisaged it, it would hardly have counted as a âpin prickâ. By the way, at the same time as the supposed Goa controversy was doing the rounds, we were the only media perhaps to carry a very critical story on Maruti and the labor conditions in their factory, even though Maruti was a potential sponsor. These are editorial judgements. One canât sniff for an agenda behind every story carried or not carried. Are you in a position to pick and choose your advertisers at this point? Are there people who would be interested in advertising to whom you say âNo thanks?â There might be some sponsors or advertisers we have said no to. For instance, we took advertising from Vedanta once, which our marketing team had got, and I said their public record has been so bad that if we can, we should avoid it. (Incidentally, we had a story against them the same week as their ad.) But such cases of turning down ads as a policy would be rare. Itâs a luxury very few publications can afford. So far Tehelkaâs maxim has been that we have used the money of the rich to tell the stories of the poor. But, overall, I think this issue of advertising and sponsorships is again a very tricky one. The kind of journalism we feel wedded to — investigative, high narrative journalism — actually needs very skilled and very intellectually strong journalists to do that. When you come with high skills, you want a high pay. There are all the other production and distribution costs. So itâs no that you can turn down advertising or sponsorships. I think the more crucial question is, how do you balance your advertiser and sponsor money with the kind of work you want to pursue? So far, I think weâve managed pretty well. A good example of this would be a really big event Tehelka did a few years ago called the Summit of the Powerless. It was an idea before itâs time. It brought peopleâs movements, corporations and political power to the same table. Five to six years back we were discussing farmer suicides, tribals, Dalits, land — all the issues that have really come to dominate public discourse now. The sponsors for this summit were DLF and Coca-Cola and â¦ I forget who else. Some in the NGO community were flabbergasted, asking, âHow can an institution like Tehelka take money from Coke or from DLF?â But we were easy in our conscience and skin even then because the triumph was to make corporates like this fund a conference like that, where people were bringing their grievances onto the table, were talking issues of justice. Without that funding we would have been talking only to the converted. The Goa Think Fest was constructed with the same impulse. Its conception was more eclectic but many sessions spoke strongly of tribal and mining rights and corporate misgovernance. You take the money and you keep trying and pushing through persuasion, through individual relationships, try and push what those corporates will stomach their money being used for. We are not existentially anti-corporate, we donât believe that entrepreneurship itself is necessarily evil. Repeatedly, the world is showing you that as information spreads, people are more connected through technology and the media, you cannot any longer do business in the old feudal ways or in the old colonial ways. Indiaâs national elections began April 7 and will continue on nine separate dates until May 12, with results expected to be announced on May 16. The vote is the worldâs largest, with 814 million eligible voters set to choose 543 members of the lower house of Parliament. The other two seats will be appointed by the president. This election is widely considered to be Indiaâs most consequential since 1977. India Ink will be moving to the World page of The New York Times.

"How Libya can deal with the problem of militias","Contact author  Fri 11 Oct 2013 13.58 BST   L ibya is back in the headlines after a powerful Islamist-dominated militia group abducted the country's prime minister, Ali Zeidan, amid anger over a US special forces raid on Saturday during which a Libyan al-Qaida suspect, Abu Anas al-Liby, was seized. The impunity with which militia groups are able to operate in the country puts it on par with the lawlessness that has been seen in Iraq, Afghanistan and Somalia, where even some of the most audacious and organised of militants are unable to reach as sensitive and important a target as a sitting prime minister. Libya is different for the reason that it has no national army. It has a series of disparate autonomous militia groups who are heavily entrenched in Libya's politics, economy and society. In other words, they are now a part of the daily routine and have become inseparable from the state and broader Libyan society. The independence this gives them has worsened Libya's security environment, given that various militia groups are at odds with one another, often resulting in clashes between them, as well as with the state itself. Post-conflict states like Libya are generally required to, first and foremost, develop a strong state and centralise authority in the country, if indeed a centralist political and constitutional process is preferred. In Libya, the failure to disarm militias has only bought them more time to consolidate their hold on the country. Elections last year, the country's first in decades and its first since the former regime was ousted, compounded the militia problem by allowing prominent, well-organised and armed groups to consolidate their positions, legitimise their influence as well as cement their newfound status and power. In other words, Libya cannot move forward, stabilise and become the democratic state most Libyans and the international community hoped it would be when Muammar Gaddafi was ousted in November 2011. Three realistic scenarios now lie ahead. First, Libya can aim to continue its process of reconciliation and engagement, hoping that militia groups can somehow be persuaded to lay down their arms, become active and genuine players in a political process as well as collectively form a national army. This, however, is unlikely. Efforts have been made toward integrating militias into the political process and reaching some form of plausible and long-term settlement, albeit to no avail. The second option is to accept the status quo and accept that Libya's security environment will continue to be loosely structured and decentralised. This political and security framework is a product of the post-Arab-spring Libyan uprising, which allowed independent revolutionary brigades, tied to semi-independent major cities such as Misrata, to operate as state within states and mount attacks against the former regime on two separate fronts from the east and west of the country. This option will require the militias to be integrated into a representative and proper power-sharing mechanism that will essentially see Libya adopt federalism. In other words, sustain the militias' current military control but as part of a regulated framework underpinned by dispute-resolution mechanisms and one that makes them more organised, efficient and accountable forces able to not just protect their local regions but also Libya's borders. The challenge, however, will be convincing Libyans that this is not tantamount to partition, which most are fiercely against. The final option runs the risk of producing more intense violence and bloodshed, civil war in other words that could take Libya to the brink. Producing a viable and heavily armed national army would encourage militia groups to embolden their own forces and weaponry, with the aim of preparing themselves for a war with the state in what would be their battle for survival. Prominent militia groups may be encouraged to relinquish their weapons and subject themselves to state authority. Then again, they may call the state's bluff. All of these are long-term solutions for the country. Some carry a higher risk of producing more violence and bloodshed than others. All three, in any case, will require Libyans to take bold, painful and decisive steps. In the short-term, the country is likely to witness reprisal attacks as well as continued clashes. The kidnapping of the prime minister may prompt militia groups to assert their positions and capitalise on the state's apparent weakness and severe loss of credibility.

"The Market Shall Set North Korea Free","Advertisement Supported by Op-Ed Contributor By  Jang Jin-Sung Seoul I DEFECTED from North Korea in 2004. I decided to risk my life to leave my home country — where I worked as a psychological warfare officer for the government — when it finally sunk in that there are two North Koreas: one real and the other a fiction created by the regime. Although in my job I had access to foreign media, books with passages containing criticism of our Dear Leader Kim Jong-il or his revered father, Kim Il-sung, had large sections blacked out. One day, out of deep curiosity, I made up an excuse to stay behind at work to decipher the redacted words of a history book. I locked the office door and put the pages against a window. Light from outside made the words under the ink perfectly clear. I read voraciously. I stayed late at work again and again to learn my country’s real history — or at least another view of it. Most shocking was what I discovered about the Korean War. We had been taught all of our lives how an invasion by the South had triggered the conflict. Yet now I was reading that not only South Korea but the rest of the world believed the North had started the war. Who was right? It was after my harrowing defection — in which I bribed my way to a border crossing and escaped by running across a frozen river to China — that I recognized the existence of a third North Korea: a theoretical one. This is the North Korea constructed by the outside world, a piecemeal analysis of the regime and its propaganda that misses the political and economic realities of the country. All of us at the United Front Department — also known as “the window into and out of North Korea” — learned three tenets of diplomacy by heart: 1. Pay no attention to South Korea. 2. Exploit Japan’s emotions. 3. Ply the United States with lies, but make sure they are logical ones. Kim Jong-il stressed the importance of these three tenets as the framework within which we were required to implement his vision for Pyongyang’s foreign relations. North Korea’s dealings with South Korea, Japan and the United States always hewed closely to these principles. Our department’s mission was to deceive our people and the world, doing what was necessary to keep our leader in power. We openly referred to talks with South Korea as “aid farming,” because while Seoul sought dialogue through its so-called Sunshine Policy, we saw it as an opening not for diplomatic progress but for extracting as much aid as possible. We also successfully bought time for our nuclear program through the endless marathon of the six-party talks. Despite Pyongyang’s deceptive ways, many people in the outside world continue to believe in the theoretical North Korea in which dialogue with the regime is seen as the way to effect change. But I know from my years inside the government that talking will not get Pyongyang to turn any corners, not even with the North’s current leader, Kim Jong-un. Dialogue will never entice the regime to give up its nuclear weapons; the nuclear program is tightly linked to its survival. And talks will not lead to change over the long term; the regime sees them only as a tool for extracting aid. High-level diplomacy is no strategy for getting the regime to make economic reforms. The key to change lies outside the sway of the regime — in the flourishing underground economy. All North Koreans depended for their very survival on a state rationing system until it collapsed in the mid-1990s. Its demise was due in part to the regime’s concentrated investment of funds in a “party economy” that maintained the cult of the Kims and lavished luxuries on an elite instead of developing a normal economy based on domestic production and trade. Desperate people began to barter household goods for rice on the streets — and the underground economy was born. With thousands of people starving to death, the authorities had no option but to turn a blind eye to all the illegal markets that began to pop up. Around this time, the nation’s workplaces were made responsible for feeding their employees. The only way they could do so was by setting up “trading companies,” which sold raw materials to China in exchange for rice. These businesses became part of the foundation of the underground economy, acting as import-export hubs that in time began to import from China consumer goods like refrigerators and radios. Likewise, party officials started to take part in wheeling and dealing, profiting through bribe-collecting and prohibited financing activities. Nowadays the party is so deeply involved in the market economy that the “trading companies” are staffed by the children of party officials and openly operate on behalf of the party and military. In short, all of North Korea has come to rely on a market economy, and no place in the country is untouched by it. The social effect of the rise of the market has been extraordinary: The umbilical cord between the individual and the state has been severed. In the people’s eyes, loyalty to the state has been replaced by the value of hard cash. And the U.S. greenback is the currency of choice. Trading with their U.S. dollars (many of which are counterfeit) for Chinese products, North Koreans have come to recognize the existence of leaders greater even than the Kims. Who are these men gracing U.S. bank notes? North Koreans now see that loyalty to the supreme leader has brought no tangible benefits; yet currency bearing the faces of American men is exchanged for many things: rice, meat, even a promotion at work. Today, when North Koreans are ordered by their state employer to take part in political activities, they know their time is being wasted. Fewer North Koreans show up for their state jobs. This growing economic and psychological independence among regular people is becoming the greatest thorn in the regime’s side. It is also the key to change. Instead of focusing on the regime and its agents as possible instigators of reform, we must recognize the power of the flourishing marketplace to slowly but definitively transform North Korea from the bottom up. This empowerment of the North Korean people is crucial not only for a positive transformation of the nation, but also for ensuring a stable transition to the new era after the regime eventually goes. Increasing trade with China has made the North Korean border porous in many ways, facilitating a flow of information in and out of the country. Many North Koreans can now access South Korean television programs that are smuggled in on DVDs or memory sticks. One way to accelerate change would be by continuing to broadcast into the country so that North Koreans can access outside radio programming on their illegal devices more easily. Another is to support the work of North Korean exiles, who are a conduit of goods and liberal ideas across the border. Talks with Pyongyang can only offer temporary solutions to manufactured crises. And I can say from my experience, they encourage only more deception from the North. Looking at North Korea from below, building on the market realities on the ground, is the only effective way to make the regime reform — or go. Advertisement"
"More About Italy","Dean Baker, in correspondence, makes an interesting point about the mysterious productivity collapse in Italy — namely, that a big chunk of it could be a statistical illusion. This is always something you should consider when you see something strange in economic data. Here’s the story: Italy, with its combination of extensive regulations and weak enforcement, used to have a lot of “black labor” — workers who weren’t on the books, so as to evade various government-imposed requirements. But then came reforms that made keeping part-time workers, etc., on the books less onerous — and the hidden labor came into the open. Measured GDP wasn’t affected, because statisticians were already making imputations for the shadow economy; so the result was a decline in measured productivity. One thing I like about this story is that it makes sense of another anomaly: wide divergence in different measures of Italian cost competitiveness, for example in this IMF study (pdf). Here’s a chart of estimated real effective exchange rates: I’d discount the unit value measure; that has always been a poor measure, and probably especially so when you’re dealing with a country that tries to export high-quality stuff. But there’s still a huge divergence between the unit labor cost measure, which suggests large overvaluation, and other measures — which is exactly what you’d expect if you had underreported productivity. Balance of payments data are also sort of consistent with this story: Italy never had huge, Spanish-style current account deficits. I don’t want to claim that all is OK with Italy; clearly, the country has dysfunctional markets, a lot of monopoly rents, and is lagging in the use of information technology. But arguably it isn’t the basket case some numbers suggest. And yes, you do wonder why the austerity program has to be as harsh as it is. Paul Krugman is an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times.

"Trump has no idea how to run a superpower, say Chinese media","Communist party-controlled Global Times says Trump ‘is not behaving as a president who will become master of the White House’  Tom Phillips in Beijing  Mon 19 Dec 2016 07.26 GMT   First published on Mon 19 Dec 2016 03.28 GMT   Donald Trump appears to have not a clue how to lead a superpower. That was the conclusion of China’s Global Times newspaper on Monday morning as the country’s media weighed in on the president-elect’s latest social media assaults on Beijing . “Trump is not behaving as a president who will become master of the White House in a month,” the Communist party controlled newspaper wrote in an editorial . “He bears no sense of how to lead a superpower.” The article came after the US president-elect again used Twitter, which has been blocked in China since 2009 , to berate the leaders of the world’s second largest economy. “China steals United States Navy research drone in international waters – rips it out of water and takes it to China in unpresidented [sic] act,” Trump tweeted early on Saturday morning after it emerged the Chinese navy had seized a US naval drone that had been operating in the South China Sea. In a second tweet, Trump wrote: We should tell China that we don't want the drone they stole back.- let them keep it! Those 221 characters threatened to further alienate China’s rulers, already reeling from Trump’s recent decision to hold a 10-minute phone call with the Taiwanese president, Tsai Ing-wen , and threat to upend long-standing US policy on Taiwan . On Friday, President Obama cautioned Trump against allowing relations with China slip into “full conflict mode” . In its editorial, the fervently nationalist Global Times, a state-run tabloid that sometimes reflects official thinking, indicated such a deterioration was certainly on the cards if Trump continued to act up. People in China were unsure whether the billionaire’s attacks on Beijing were part of attempts to wage a psychological war or simply an example of his amateurishness. “But if he treats China after assuming office in the same way as in his tweets, China will not exercise restraint,” the newspaper warned. “The Chinese government should be fully prepared for a hardline Trump.” In an online video that has been viewed hundreds of thousands of times, the newspaper’s controversial editor, Hu Xijin, said: “I don’t know if he is playing the psychological card with China or is in fact just unprofessional … China should teach him some lessons so he might learn to respect China after he is sworn in.” A comment piece on the front page of the overseas edition of the Communist party’s official mouthpiece, the People’s Daily, also suggested Beijing would not be cowed by Trump’s provocations. “It is difficult to understand his true psychology,” wrote Hua Yiwen, whom the paper described as an international affairs expert. “But China shouldn’t spend much effort trying to guess what he is thinking. We should simply stand firm, take control of the situation and handle it calmly.” Bill Bishop, a Washington DC-based China expert, said he sensed “abject despair” in the US capital at how Trump was conducting US-China relations through misspelled tweets . “This is unpresidented behaviour by a precedent-elect,” joked Bishop. “It would be funny if the stakes weren’t so high.” “This is not a business deal. This is a political relationship between nuclear powers who are already on the path towards conflict in several dimensions,” added Bishop, who publishes the influential Sinocism newsletter. “This kind of uncertainty, this kind of petulance, this kind of random tweeting … is not a grand strategy that is going to push the Chinese on to their heels so they are going to make concessions. This is juvenile, immature, inexperienced behaviour that has the potential to lead to many problems in the US-China relationship, some of which could have some pretty serious and damaging ramifications.” Bishop questioned the Chinese media’s suggestion that Trump’s tweets were part of a wily psychological ploy to force trade concessions from Beijing. “I wouldn’t ascribe brilliant psychological warfare skills to Donald Trump,” he said. Was it possible Trump’s tweets were part of an ingenious new master plan for Sino-US relations that would emerge after his inauguration on 20 January? Bishop was skeptical. “I think that is about as likely as Xi Jinping waking up on 1 December, 2017 and declaring China a democracy.”"
"A Dark Age of macroeconomics (wonkish)","Brad DeLong is upset about the stuff coming out of Chicago these days — and understandably so. First Eugene Fama , now John Cochrane , have made the claim that debt-financed government spending necessarily crowds out an equal amount of private spending, even if the economy is depressed — and they claim this not as an empirical result, not as the prediction of some model, but as the ineluctable implication of an accounting identity. There has been a tendency, on the part of other economists, to try to provide cover — to claim that Fama and Cochrane said something more sophisticated than they did. But if you read the original essays, there’s no ambiguity — it’s pure Say’s Law, pure “Treasury view”, in each case. Here’s Fama: The problem is simple: bailouts and stimulus plans are funded by issuing more government debt. (The money must come from somewhere!) The added debt absorbs savings that would otherwise go to private investment. In the end, despite the existence of idle resources, bailouts and stimulus plans do not add to current resources in use. They just move resources from one use to another. And here’s Cochrane: First, if money is not going to be printed, it has to come from somewhere. If the government borrows a dollar from you, that is a dollar that you do not spend, or that you do not lend to a company to spend on new investment. Every dollar of increased government spending must correspond to one less dollar of private spending.  Jobs created by stimulus spending are offset by jobs lost from the decline in private spending. We can build roads instead of factories, but fiscal stimulus canât help us to build more of both.1  This is just accounting, and does not need a complex argument about âcrowding out.â Second, investment is âspendingâ every bit as much as consumption. Fiscal stimulus advocates want money spent on consumption, not saved.  They evaluate past stimulus programs by whether people who got stimulus money spent it on consumption goods rather save it.  But the economy overall does not care if you buy a car, or if you lend money to a company that buys a forklift. There’s no ambiguity in either case: both Fama and Cochrane are asserting that desired savings are automatically converted into investment spending, and that any government borrowing must come at the expense of investment — period. What’s so mind-boggling about this is that it commits one of the most basic fallacies in economics — interpreting an accounting identity as a behavioral relationship. Yes, savings have to equal investment, but that’s not something that mystically takes place, it’s because any discrepancy between desired savings and desired investment causes something to happen that brings the two in line. It’s like the fact that the capital account and the current account of the balance of payment have to sum to zero: that’s true, but it does not mean that an increase in capital inflows magically translates into a trade deficit, without anything else changing (what John Williamson used to call the doctrine of immaculate transfer). A capital inflow produces a trade deficit by causing the exchange rate to appreciate, the price level to rise, or some other change in the real economy that affects trade flows. Similarly, after a change in desired savings or investment something happens to make the accounting identity hold. And if interest rates are fixed, what happens is that GDP changes to make S and I equal. That’s actually the point of one of the ways multiplier analysis is often presented to freshmen. Here’s the diagram: In this picture savings plus taxes equal investment plus government spending, the accounting identity that both Fama and Cochrane think vitiates fiscal policy — but it doesn’t. An increase in G doesn’t reduce I one for one, it increases GDP, which leads to higher S and T. Now, you don’t have to accept this model as a picture of how the world works. But you do have to accept that it shows the fallacy of arguing that the savings-investment identity proves anything about the effectiveness of fiscal policy. So how is it possible that distinguished professors believe otherwise? The answer, I think, is that we’re living in a Dark Age of macroeconomics. Remember, what defined the Dark Ages wasn’t the fact that they were primitive — the Bronze Age was primitive, too. What made the Dark Ages dark was the fact that so much knowledge had been lost, that so much known to the Greeks and Romans had been forgotten by the barbarian kingdoms that followed. And that’s what seems to have happened to macroeconomics in much of the economics profession. The knowledge that S=I doesn’t imply the Treasury view — the general understanding that macroeconomics is more than supply and demand plus the quantity equation — somehow got lost in much of the profession. I’m tempted to go on and say something about being overrun by barbarians in the grip of an obscurantist faith, but I guess I won’t. Oh wait, I guess I just did. Comments are no longer being accepted. In my view, people know quite a bit about macroeconomics after taking a couple of undergraduate classes, but unlearn most of it in PhD macro courses, where IS-LM and such are never mentioned again. It says something about the hubristic tendencies of economists, that the Chicago economists are as certain of their correctness now as Irving Fisher was prior to the Great Depression.  Of course, Keynesians had their own day in the sun and were similarly arrogant during the 1960s.  Why abandon a beautiful model just because it doesn’t fit the facts? While this doesn’t speak to your point precisely, I think the public perception of economics suffers from a couple of problems.  The first is the layman perception of economics, which has been influenced greatly by talking heads and Republican politicians, to try and simplify it into a few talking points which are largely empirically untrue, but nonetheless quite stubborn.  The other is that economics appears simple and elemental to layman, leading them to claim false expertise based on experience.  Your comments section is a perfect example – how many comments have you gotten which start off with “well I may not have a Nobel Prize in Economics or all your fancy Ivy League degrees, but I know about economics…”  The profusion of this sort of folksy stupidity must make you want to tear your hair out.  Personally, I can’t tell you the number of times I’ve had to explain that microeconomics is not simply a supply and demand chart.  And the concepts of marginal revenue/cost and elasticity are simply not worth teaching to people who’ve already formed a view, without the benefit of facts. I think another problem is that obviously the politics of the time seem to be having an impact on the scholarship and policy, which is unfortunate.  As you know, much of what is asserted can be easily disputed via empirical results, but for some reason people rarely ask to see the numbers.  It’s easier to consider things in terms of axioms, most of which turn out to be completely wrong. It’s unfortunate, but I’m hoping that the age of Obama can dispel this notion that we are entitled to both our own opinions and our own facts.  If nothing else, a return to evidence-based thinking would be a lasting contribution to the democracy. It appears that a substantial portion of the economics profession accepted Reagan’s dogma that  government is not the solution, it is the problem. They  were well paid for their adherence to orthodoxy. Since big decisions are riding on these arguments I’m frustrated by the indirect nature of the debate.  I want Chicago champions and Keynesian champions to meet in a Steel Cage Match to hammer out all these points in one place for us to ponder. Sometimes I can’t believe how simplistic economic reasoning appears to be.  If your summary of Fama and Cochrane is accurate, theyâre merely looking at a snapshot of the moment the government issues new debt for economic stimulus.  They’re ignoring the fact that much of that debt will be purchased by individuals, institutions and governments outside of the U.S. economy.  They’re also ignoring the fact that, after the stimulus, some participants within the U.S. economy will have more money at their disposal for saving or investment than they did before the stimulus.  For example, an unemployed person may suddenly begin spending more and start saving money.  And what about the multiplier effect?  The idea that the issuance of government debt immediately diminishes private investment seems like an absurd construction to me.  How can you guys all be in the same profession? My own impression  (from my terminal MA at a prestigious Canadian university) is that academic economics as an intellectual endeavour is utterly lost.  It got lost because it placed the fetish of mathematical modelling over the basics of sound thinking and analysis:  defining your terms carefully, thinking about underlying institutional structure, being willing to entertain different views of how the world works (while being willing to compare and contrast these views in a consistent intellectual framework).  Economics as it is currently constituted thinks that pushing symbols around on a chalkboard is “analysis”, and that the only ingredient for “rigour” is that no algebraic mistakes are made. And now we see the full flowering of this intellectual bankruptcy:  professors at prestigious universities making elementary errors of economic reasoning, because economic reasoning is something they neither TEACH or have LEARNED. Burn the economics academy down.  Burn it down and start over. What’s amazing to me is that the Republican free-market/anti-government philosophy has had such a poisonous effect on all levels of policy and thought on the subject. I’m not educated enough in the subject matter to express an opinion on the economic content presented in this article, but I do understand the message: “People who really should know better, don’t.” That’s truly scary. Keep up the good work, Mr. Krugman. You are not going to get a meaningful prediction in economics from an equation.  Equations are fine for illustrating basic principles in textbooks, but outcomes in the real world are a matter of integration of the effect of many variables over a long period of time.  Since economists can’t predict even the simplest things a few months in advance, mathematical predictions are basically worthless.  Economists seem to be preoccupied with using meaningless mathematical models to justify their prejudices, while at the same time ignoring clear signs from fundamental indicators, such as stock and housing prices, that things are out of whack. Moreover S=I holds only in a closed economy. If you consider the international dimension, things get more complicated. Remember the Feldstein Horioka puzzle? Paul, I heard the same arguments last night on the News Hour . Where do the nay sayers think money comes from? Don’t they understand that the government can print money; so much (even all) of the pump-priming can come from newly issued notes, not someone’s mattress?  Or is this not a fair view? Perhaps you can explain why the answer: “The government can print the money, stupid!” is the incorrect answer. But I fully agree with your point about the Dark Ages. I find it stunning that so many academicians are in the iron group of dogma. What’s next, the Chicago Inquisition? “We can build roads instead of factories, but fiscal stimulus canât help us to build more of both.” Aside from the theoretical lapses, this is contradicted by the enormous increase in total GDP in WW II.  Was this produced by tax cuts?  What looking-glass do these people use to get into their fact-free wonderland? One of my favorite non-fiction authors, John Ralston Saul, often remarks that the end of the Enlightenment, our time, reflects the end of the feudal age it replaced. Knowledge in the feudal age was not meant to improve understanding of the world. It was meant to support the status quo. Its purpose was to make sure that things didn’t change, that those with power remained in power. Whether such knowledge was in tune with the way the world worked or that knowledge improved the lot of society was not a consideration. A pity we’ve returned to that time. Why do you think they’re committed to the view that savings automatically equals investment? They can accept that there’s some sort of delay. The point is just that due to the fact that savings eventually equals investment that the stimulus won’t be effective. What you have to argue is that there is some mechanism that functions in the delay between the equilibration of savings and investment that will make the opportunity costs of the stimulus worthwhile. But what is that argument supposed to be? This explanation doesn’t seem to prove that an increase in government spending leads to a higher GDP.  There’s more than one degree of freedom.  It shows that an increase in government spending leads either to a higher GDP, or lower investment.  Similarly a reduction in taxes could lead to an increase in savings, or an increase in GDP.  That still leaves us with the question of what kind of stimulus, if any, works.  Prof. Krugman has argued in this blog that Keynesian stimulus hasn’t worked in the past because it isn’t fast or big enough.   That would suggest that increasing government spending first drives out a certain amount of investment, then (hopefully, there isn’t much historical precedent) starts increasing GDP if the stimulus is sufficiently huge.  I shudder to think just how much additional debt we need to go into to achieve the small, temporary gains promised by the stimulus package. Is Krugman arguing for what should happen in an ideal world, rather than what actually tends to happen in the real world? Once again, Krugman ignores how the government gets its money. First let us recall that for an average tax rate t, T=t*GDP and S=(1-t)*GDP.  Lets say t is 0.35. Krugman wants us to increase G as a way to increase the GDP.  Lets say we increase G, and therefore the GDP, by 100. Without changing the tax rate, T grows by 35 and S grows by 65.  But now our government is 65 extra in debt.  With interest we end up paying back about 75 or so, depending on how long it takes to pay back. So, while in the short term our GDP grew, in the long term we reduced our GDP by about 10 while we pay off debt. Remember, every dollar spent must be taxes now or taxed plus interest in the future.  Because if this it is impossible for the government to raise the GDP in the long term.  They can only raise it in the short term through deficit spending which will decrease in in the long run. Their arguments are a crass oversimplification, I think. Why does public spending crowd out provate spending? First, you have a time relationship that’s ignored: The “bill will not come due” right away for the public spending, so clearly private spending can happen during this interim. Second you have the place relationship that is ignored. Public and private spending are not going to occur in the same place. Gov’t by its very nature will spend money in the places that private industry won’t, or can’t. These people are clutching at straws to come up with a rational argument to support their prejudices, and they are failing. Dear Mr. Krugman, An easier way to understand why Fama and Cochrane are wrong is to simply point out that the accounting identity is static.  It only describes a moment in time.  How do they explain that the numbers in the identity change when measured at different times.  Where does the growth or shrinkage come from? That we are in the dark ages is in part the fault of Keynesian economists themselves (ourselves). In contrast to the enormous amount of research done on monetary policy as a stabilization tool, we have done very little to modernize the way we think of fiscal policy. As John Cochrane pointed out in the Chicago forum that everyone’s been watching, you can search through graduate economics textbooks and lecture notes and never see a coherent case made for the efficacy of fiscal stabilization policy. So it’s little wonder that the knowledge we had in the 1960s (say) has been lost. These are very complex arguments in which there are no simple answers. I do not believe that one can reply to these arguments as a piece. Fama suggests that the equation is that, as you rightly infer to his argument, the government spending not only crowds out private spending but does so in such a way that it actualy inhibits growth because the investments are less valuable in the long run. These investments have a terminus, if you will, but in private investment they not only continue but consequently have a much greater multiplier. Cochrane has a much simpler argument really. His whole argument is based on the idea that there is a financial equation having to do with borrowing, with interest rates, with government participation that is not coming out right. His argument seems to be that equation simply does not compute. The amount of money and the characteristics of the currnent bail out proposal are inefficient because the numbers simply do not balance. Hence, the argument about their being accounting rather than economic arguments. I think only Cochrane’s are such. But just as Say’s law does not apply in a modern situation where the “production”  are actually the financial instruments themselves, these arguments are wrong because they are not accurate in the current situation. The problem is that when they are applied to the bail-out, they lump the entire bail-out program into one premise. And the bail-out is not one homogenous entity. It is actually several different policies. One could be termed a welfare program. Another could be termed a government infrastructure program, such as the often used example–the federal interstate highway program. Another aspect still in the plan is a program of upgrades on existing government programs that have been neglected. One could make a strong case that all these are not necessary efficient stimuli…they are not all meant to be. The argument against the stimulus program, as done by Fama and Cochrane is false because they argue only against the basic theory of government versus private spending, and government borrowing against the various potential results. The latter would be either failure of the program to stimulate or successful stimulation followed by severe (my interpretation) inflation. But the suggestion that the current situation matches the conditions required for the logic to work is wrong. In order for Fama and Cochrane’s analysis to be correct, they must first separate the issues. I am not sure that if you asked either one: should we have a more aggressive welfare segment (food stamps, expanded unemployment, etc) that they would disagree. When you lump all the various ideas and programs together, as they have done, you can make an argument. Not a good one. Not an accurate one. But in each case, one that, if properly addressed, does raise important issues. One important issue I would cite is whether economists, at the outset, should not more carefully target their arguments so that whatever part of a policy may have flaws, that aspect is truly and accurately analyzed. And those parts that are important, urgent, even essential to survival in some cases, will not be inhibited by politicians using false arguments to keep vital services from the people. I think that many of these deniers actually believe that a stimulus by government spending can influence behavior, but they’re worried that accepting that fact will commit them to a stimulus by government spending. Although their use of equations seems simplistic and mechanistic, so does picking an amount for the stimulus as you do. You make it sound as if we’re changing the oil. As well, I feel that infrastructure spending should be efficient and necessary. Just picking a number makes it sound like we’ll spend a lot of money foolishly. I agree that a stimulus can effect behavior as we wish. I believe it because my political economy is a lot like Shiller’s. I read  that he advocates a massive stimulus. And here’s my problem. I’m with Shiller on the stimulus. In order to work well, it needs to be very large. However, I’m also with Buiter, in believing  that this spending carries serious risk for us going forward. Consequently, I end up with a plan much like the administration’s. I also don’t consider social safety net spending a stimulus. It’s what we should do in order to help our citizens get through this crisis. By calling it a stimulus, I’m not sure if these government spending critics are saying that we shouldn’t spend on the social safety net, or simply that they don’t think that infrastructure spending works as a stimulus. As I said, I do, when it’s very large. The “stuff coming out of Chicago” would have to improve quite a bit to meet the standards of the Dark Ages. We’re talking more Old Stone Age, here. From the point of view of someone who does not understand economics but realizes that economists have tremendous influence in this world, the enormous range of policy positions in the field make it very difficult to see economists as anything other than highly skilled advocates. Asking and economist what economics tells us about an important problem is just the same as asking a lawyer what law tells you about something. The lawyer’s job is to make the law say what someone wants the law to say. Granted that, I certainly prefer Krugman’s point of view, or DeLong’s, to that of th right wing fanatics at Chicago or George Mason. Another way to look at it is the M*V=Y*P. (M is Money, V is the velocity or Turnover rate of the Money, Y is the output level of the economy {real GDP}, and P is the nominal Price level) During a banana, errr I mean Liquidity trap, M keeps going up from central bank injections, but V goes down as institutions keep hoarding cash.  GDP or Y*P more or less stays the same as more and more money does injected into the economy is trapped in a liquidity pool, not being invested because the expectations for the return on that investment are too low. When the government spends money, say on construction of a bridge it instantly creates new jobs, with new  income.  Those new income with be spent, at least a portion of the incomes…so on and so forth. The government did not print the money it borrowed it, from a pool of money that was not being used because invesment expectations were so low (we are in a depression)  This has a direct effect on V.  Velocity increases while M money stays about the same.  Since we are below full emplyment Y output goes up without much counter effect on P prices. To be fair to the barbarians, the chart doesn’t prove the point professor Krugman is making. Yes, an increase in G will lead to an increase in NOMINAL GDP. But, if the economy is at or near full employment, this will occur through an increase in the price level, not an increase in real production. If there are major structural distortions or imbalances in the economy, this may happen even if the economy is not close to full employment. I realize this situation doesn’t apply now (or at least I hope it doesn’t) but it means that the “barbarians” aren’t quite as clueless as Krugman makes them out to be. Paul Krugman is an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times. Advertisement"
"A Conversation With: Anna Hazare","When we arrived in Anna Hazareâs village, the famous Ralegan Siddhi in rural Maharashtra, late last week, an aide had a curt message for us. Anna-ji, he said icily, was recovering from a long journey the previous day and would not be receiving any visitors. Apparently Mr. Hazare hadnât received the memo. We found him sitting beneath a vast peepal tree in the courtyard of the village’s Padmavati Temple, a sprawling compound which serves as both office and residence for Mr. Hazare. He was dressed in his usual outfit of white khadi kurta pajama topped by a jaunty topi, listening to the complaints of some local auto workers. If he was tired he didnât show it. Once the meeting wrapped up he beckoned us into the small, pink-walled room where he sleeps on an iron cot. In the weeks since he ended his 12-day fast, he has largely been resting in Ralegan Siddhi. Sitting cross-legged on a thin mattress, a chipper and smiling Mr. Hazare spoke to us about Mahatma Gandhi, the rifts within his social movement, how he spends his days and his plan for politics. Some people compare you to Gandhi. How do you feel about that comparison? That is not fair. I am not able to even sit at Gandhiâs feet. But I try to follow his philosophy. Your fasts have been called political blackmail. Is that fair? What do you mean, blackmail? Am I asking for money? They have forgotten the constitution. In 1950, the people became owners of this country. Because all the people cannot go to Parliament, we have elected [politicians] to make good laws and to take care of the treasury. If they are not making good laws and not keeping the treasury clean, if I protest against that, it is not blackmail. How do you spend your day? I get up at 5. I do one-and-half hours of yoga, pranayama, than meditation. At 8:30, people start coming. This continues till evening. In between I find time to write letters. I sleep at 10. What do you eat every day? Roti and vegetables, one time per day. In the morning I take milk. In the evening I take one glass of juice. Thousands of people came out to support your fast. Are you worried that peopleâs expectations of change are too high? This question occurs to me, also. I donât have wealth. I live in a temple. How can a man like me, who lives in a temple, fulfill the expectations of people all across the country? What can I do? But I have faith in God that whatever the expectations of the people, somehow God will find a way for these things to be done. What is next for you? What are your aspirations? I donât have any aspirations. I do my selfless work. Do you want to be prime minister? Get into politics? This is muck for me. I will neither contest elections nor make a party nor go into politics. But in four or five years, if I get good people, I will ask them to fight elections. Some accuse you of having contempt for democracy. People of character and principle should sit in these positions. [Parliament] is the holy temple of democracy. Holy people should go there. In our Parliament today there are 150 people with criminal backgrounds. Among your allies are Prashant Bhushan, who criticizes economic liberalization, and Arvind Kejriwal, who has been criticized for saying overly harsh things about the prime minister. Do you agree with them, and is there disunity among your senior leaders? I will try to change them. There were some ego problems. From the government side it was Chidambaram and Kapil Sibal. From our side also there were some issues. I was not getting the right feedback, nor was the prime minister. That complicated the issues. Later, Vilasrao Deshmukh and another minister got involved and direct contact with the prime minister was established. I have an old relationship with Vilasrao. Then the issues were resolved. They [Mr. Bhushan and Mr. Kejriwal] are good people. I need to change them. I will change them. Indiaâs national elections began April 7 and will continue on nine separate dates until May 12, with results expected to be announced on May 16. The vote is the worldâs largest, with 814 million eligible voters set to choose 543 members of the lower house of Parliament. The other two seats will be appointed by the president.

"Turkish PM Davutoğlu resigns as President Erdoğan tightens grip","Departure will allow Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, to further consolidate power  Constanze Letsch in Istanbul  Thu 5 May 2016 15.22 BST   First published on Thu 5 May 2016 00.13 BST   The Turkish prime minister, Ahmet Davutoğlu, has announced his resignation after 20 months in office, consolidating Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s position as Turkey’s unrivalled political leader and highlighting concerns about the country turning increasingly authoritarian. The resignation, rumoured for several days amid deteriorating relations between the two leaders, paves the way for President Erdoğan to appoint an even more loyalist party member as Davutoğlu’s successor, a move dubbed a “palace coup” by critics and opposition politicians. Speaking at the Justice and Development (AKP) party’s headquarters in Ankara, Davutoğlu said he would step down after an extraordinary party meeting on 22 May and not run for the office again. “After consultations with the president I decided that it would be more appropriate for the unity of [the AKP] to change the chairman,” Davutoğlu said, adding that his period in office had been a successful one: “I have no sense of failure or regret in taking that decision.” He said he would “continue the struggle” as a party legislator. The announcement came one day after intense talks between Erdoğan and Davutoğlu, during which they did not manage to smooth out their differences. Tension had been simmering since shortly after Davutoğlu replaced Erdoğan as prime minister in August 2014 but recently intensified. The closely watched discussion held on Wednesday night in the presidential palace in Ankara followed the publication of a posting on the anonymous Turkish blog Pelican Brief , named in a nod to the political thriller. The author, thought to be a journalist with close ties to Erdoğan, accused Davutoğlu of conspiring with Turkey’s enemies and western powers to sideline the president. But on Thursday, Davutoğlu refrained from criticising Erdoğan. “Erdoğan’s honour is my honour,” he said. “I will not accept any speculation concerning my relationship with President Erdoğan. We have always stood shoulder to shoulder.” Davutoğlu had been expected to play a backseat role as prime minister as Erdoğan pushed ahead with plans to make the largely ceremonial presidency into an all-powerful executive position, but he tried to act independently on a range of issues. His exit could pave the way for Erdoğan to hand-pick an even more loyalist and pliant head of government and push through controversial constitutional changes to strengthen the presidency. “This is a catastrophic situation,” said Levent Gültekin, a writer and columnist. “This is a decisive step towards one-man rule in Turkey. From now on the only Turkey we will be able to see is the Turkey of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan .” Gültekin added that the next party leader and prime minister would be someone “with no views or opinions of their own”. The justice minister, Bekir Bozdağ, the transport minister, Binali Yıldırım, and the government spokesman, Numan Kurtulmuş, all known to be Erdoğan loyalists, have been named as possible successors to Davutoğlu. Even Berat Albayrak, the energy minister and Erdoğan’s son-in-law, is said to be a contender. Gültekin underlined that Davutoğlu did not have sufficient support either in the AKP or among Turkey’s voters to challenge Erdoğan. “Those that don’t like Erdoğan dislike Davutoğlu even more,” he said. “The lack of support for Davutoğlu inside the AKP was one of the reasons Erdoğan chose him as prime minister in the first place. He would not have risked it if there was a chance that Davutoğlu could take even one MP with him, because Erdoğan needs the vote of every single AKP MP to reach his goals.” While there have never been open spats between the two leaders, with Davutoğlu largely appearing as Erdoğan’s compliant devotee, both men disagreed on major areas of policymaking, including the management of the economy and the possibility of the resumption of peace talks with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK) , which Erdoğan staunchly opposed. The two also differed over the pre-trial imprisonment of academics and journalists, which Davutoğlu opposed. Davutoğlu had championed a deal with the EU to stem the flow of refugees across the Aegean Sea – an issue in which the president has shown little interest. One major conflict emerged when Davutoğlu proposed and publicly backed legislation aimed at tackling corruption – known as the “transparency package”. Erdoğan, who as prime minister had been embroiled in a serious corruption scandal that involved several government officials and his immediate family, made sure the bill was withdrawn. “Erdoğan does not want anyone in the party who does not fully agree with him, or anyone who would have their own opinion on any topic,” Gültekin explained. “Davutoğlu was one of the last AK party politicians who would make suggestions of change to Erdoğan’s policies.” Rumours about a growing rift between the two boiled over last week, when the AKP’s executive board stripped Davutoğlu of his authority to appoint provincial party leaders while he was on a government visit to Qatar. “The decision to take away my authority to appoint party leaders is something I would not have expected from fellow party members,” Davutoğlu said on Thursday in a rare sign of defiance."
"Stella Rimington should stop fuelling paranoid fantasies about Jeremy Corbyn","The former MI5 chief says some of the Labour leader’s advisers were once under surveillance because they sought to ‘destroy’ democracy. No, they didn’t Contact author  Mon 16 Oct 2017 12.39 BST   Last modified on Sat 25 Nov 2017 01.54 GMT   T he former MI5 boss Stella Rimington claimed at a literary festival last week that some of the people advising Jeremy Corbyn were “familiar names”, allied to “various subversive organisations that were identified as wishing to destroy the democratic system of this country” . I don’t advise Corbyn, but I am pretty sure my name is on Dame Stella’s secret list. I was on the far left in the 80s. I actively supported the steel strike, the miners’ strike and the print strike. I opposed the Falklands war and the first Iraq war. I stood outside provincial jails shouting slogans suggesting – rightly, it turned out – that the Birmingham Six and the Guildford Four were innocent. In 1993, after Stephen Lawrence was murdered, I went on a protest march through south-east London where white racists shouted threats at us from their gardens. The police feigned deafness. Throughout this time, it was the job of special branch, not just to “find out who they were”, as Rimington suggests, but – as we now know – to disrupt the left’s activities, form fraudulent sexual relationships with activists and, in the case of the Lawrence murder, smear the victim’s family . What MI5 did is subject to the Official Secrets Act, but, given that it bugged and burgled ministers from the Wilson administration in the 60s, one can assume it was very similar. Rimington told visitors at the Cheltenham literature festival that the presence of people once targeted for surveillance around Corbyn is “quite an ironic turn of events”. In fact, it is a wonderful advertisement for democracy. The idea that the left, the miners and various environmental groups wanted to “destroy the democratic system” in the 80s was pure paranoia. If it had been true, then the thousands of hours of intelligence work at the time would have led to arrests and trials. Whatever it said in the turgid, theory-laden journals the left published, what we wanted was a left Labour government. We believed it would have to be supported by extra-parliamentary action if sabotaged by the deep state. The politicisation of policing during the miners’ strike reinforced that view. But that world is gone. Corbyn, who himself was targeted by MI5 and special branch, could soon be prime minister. With the Human Rights Act, the creation of a supreme court and the operational policing changes in the aftermath of the Macpherson report , the legal framework around policing and intelligence has tightened. The real “ironic turn of events” is that the police, armed forces and intelligence services stand to be better funded and staffed under a Labour government than the present one. The questions remain: who ordered Rimington to put the left under surveillance in the 80s, and on what grounds? There was a clear national security rationale when it came to the Communist party: it was logical to ask whether Soviet intelligence was trying to manipulate it. But Rimington wasn’t targeting the KGB: she ran an agent inside the National Union of Mineworkers, sent in “to destabilise and sabotage the union at its most critical juncture”, according to Labour MPs who signed a Commons motion. Amid the social warfare of the 80s, there are people from both sides who could say, as Rutger Hauer does in Blade Runner: “I’ve done questionable things.” Unless we’re going to have a South African-style truth and reconciliation process, the challenge is to bury the paranoia and move on. It matters because a new kind of radical social democracy stands on the brink of government. It wants to save British capitalism from wage stagnation, grotesque inequalities of wealth and the kamikaze mission of a no-deal Brexit. It wants to rescue democracy from the layers of indifference that led to the Grenfell Tower disaster. It has boosted democratic engagement, especially among the young, by building the biggest mass political party in Europe. There is zero chance of an extrajudicial reaction to a leftwing Labour government – the scenario depicted in Chris Mullin’s novel A Very British Coup . From top to bottom, the UK’s armed forces, security services and police are acutely aware of constraints on their activities by the rule of law. The law enforcement culture that allowed undercover cops to perpetrate abuses is, we must assume, gone. Likewise, by implication, the culture that allowed MI5 to “destabilise and sabotage” an entirely legal trade union must be assumed to have gone. When a serving army general told the Sunday Times in September 2015 that “the army wouldn’t stand for” a Corbyn government , few people took it seriously. Today our country is under threat: from Isis and other terrorist organisations; from Vladimir Putin’s Russia, which is waging hybrid warfare on all western democracies; and other state actors, such as with the alleged Iranian cyber-attack on parliament . The security services are our first line of defence and they need our support, as do the police and special forces who stand ready to deal with situations such as the London Bridge attack. It’s a sign of the maturity of our democracy that – in the middle of a bitterly fought election – the political parties were able to maintain cross-party unity in the face of the terrorist attacks. Briefings by unnamed former members of the security services, again designed to smear Corbyn, were largely shrugged off by the electorate. The demand for democratic change in Britain is strong. Attempts to revive the paranoid practices of the Thatcher era would have no consent among the electorate – and in an information society would be much more easily exposed. My advice to Stella Rimington is to stop replaying the 80s, get on with the 21st century and cease trying to manipulate legacy intelligence for political ends."
"Saudi arms sales are in breach of international law, Britain is told","Jamie Doward and Tom Dare  Sat 9 Jan 2016 20.01 GMT   Last modified on Sat 2 Dec 2017 04.54 GMT   The government has been put on notice that it is in breach of international law for allowing the export of British-made missiles and military equipment to Saudi Arabia that might have been used to kill civilians. The hugely embarrassing accusation comes after human rights groups, the European parliament and the UN all expressed concerns about Saudi-led coalition attacks in Yemen. Lawyers acting for the Campaign Against the Arms Trade (CAAT) have stepped up legal proceedings against the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, which approves export licences, accusing it of failing in its legal duty to take steps to prevent and suppress violations of international humanitarian law. In a 19-page legal letter seen by the Observer , CAAT warns that the government’s refusal to suspend current licences to Saudi Arabia, and its decision “to continue the granting of new licences” for military equipment that may be destined for use in Yemen, is unlawful. The letter cites article two of the EU Council Common Position on arms sales , which would compel the UK to deny an export licence if there was “a clear risk” that equipment might be used in a violation of international humanitarian law. Lawyers for CAAT have given the government 14 days to suspend licences allowing the export of military equipment to Saudi Arabia, pending the outcome of a review of its obligations under EU law and its own licensing criteria. A failure to comply would see proceedings against the government, which would force it to explain in the high court what steps it has taken to ensure that UK military hardware is not being used in breach of international law. “UK weapons have been central to a bombing campaign that has killed thousands of people, destroyed vital infrastructure and inflamed tensions in the region,” said Andrew Smith of CAAT. “The UK has been complicit in the destruction by continuing to support airstrikes and provide arms, despite strong and increasing evidence that war crimes are being committed.” The legal move places the UK’s relationship with Saudi Arabia in the spotlight at a sensitive time. Almost £6bn of UK arms have been licensed to Saudi Arabia since David Cameron took office. However, concerns about the country’s human rights record have led to calls for the UK to stop arming the Saudis. Last weekend, Saudi authorities staged a mass execution of 47 prisoners; at least four were convicted for their involvement in political protests. In the wake of the executions, Belgium announced it would ban arms sales to Saudi Arabia. Germany’s Greens have demanded their country do the same. When pressed in the past the UK has refused to suspend the arms exports, claiming that they comply with all legal frameworks. A Foreign Office minister, Tobias Ellwood, told parliament last July: “We have not seen any credible evidence that suggests that the [Saudi-led] coalition has breached the law.” However, Amnesty International has warned of “a pattern of appalling disregard for civilian lives displayed by the Saudi Arabia-led military coalition”. The UN has expressed similar concerns. Last year Saudi-led coalition strikes hit a Médecins Sans Frontières mobile clinic and hospital and several schools. Saudi coalition strikes are alleged to have targeted electricity and water plants. A spokeswoman for the Department for Business confirmed that it had received the letter, filed by law firm Leigh Day, but could not comment because of “ongoing legal action”. Last week Leigh Day defended itself against accusations that lawsuits it had brought against the government on behalf of Iraqis who claimed that they had been abused by British forces were a form of “ambulance chasing”."
"Plagiarism Is Not a Big Moral Deal","Stanley Fish on education, law and society. During my tenure as the dean of a college, I determined that an underperforming program should be closed. My wife asked me if I had ever set foot on the premises, and when I answered âno,â she said that I really should do that before wielding the axe. And so I did, in the company of my senior associate dean. We toured the offices and spoke to students and staff.Â  In the course of a conversation, one ofÂ  the programâs co-directorsÂ  pressed on me his latest book. I opened it to the concluding chapter, read the first two pages, and remarked to my associate dean, âThis is really good.â But on the way back to the administration building, I suddenly flashed on the pages I admired and began to suspect that the reason I liked them so much was that I had written them. And sure enough, when I got back to my office and pulled one of my books off the shelf, there the pages were, practically word for word. I telephoned the co-director, and told him that I had been looking at his book, and wanted to talk about it. He replied eagerly that he would come right over, but when he came in I pointed him to the two books â his and mine â set out next to each other with the relevant passages outlined by a marker.  He turned white and said that he and his co-author had divided the responsibilities for the bookâs chapters and that he had not written (perhaps âwrittenâ should be in quotes) this one. I contacted the co-author and he wrote back to me something about graduate student researchers who had given him material that was not properly identified. I made a few half-hearted efforts to contact the bookâs publisher, but IÂ didnât persist and IÂ  pretty much forgot about it, although the memory returns whenever I read yet another pieceÂ  (like one that appeared recently in The Times) about the ubiquity of plagiarism , the failure of students to understand what it is, the suspicion that they know what it is but donât care, and the outdatedness of notions like originality and single authorship on which the intelligibility of plagiarism as a concept depends. Whenever it comes up plagiarism is a hot button topic and essays about itÂ  tend to be philosophically and morally inflated. But there are really only two points to make. (1) Plagiarism is a learned sin. (2) Plagiarism is not a philosophical issue. Of course every sin is learned. Very young children do not distinguish between themselves and the world; they assume that everything belongs to them; only in time and through the conditioning of experience do they learn the distinction between mine and thine and so come to acquire the concept of stealing. The concept of plagiarism, however,Â  is learned inÂ  more specialized contexts of practice entered into only by a Â few; itâs hard to get from the notion that you shouldnât appropriate your neighborâs car to the notion that you should not repeat his words without citing him. The rule that you not use words that were first uttered or written by another without due attribution is less like the rule against stealing, which is at least culturally universal, than it is like Â the rules of golf. Â I choose golf because its rules are so much more severe and therefore so much odder than the rules of other sports.Â  In baseball you can (and should) steal bases and hide the ball. In football you can (and should) fake a pass or throw your opponent to the ground. In basketball you will be praised for obstructing an opposing playerâs view of the court by waving your hands in front of his face. In hockey â¦ well letâs not go there. Â But in golf, if you so much as move the ball accidentally while breathing on it far away from anyone who might have seen what you did, you must immediately report yourself and incur the penalty. (Think of what would happen to the base-runner called safe at home-plate who said to the umpire, âExcuse me, sir, but although you missed it, I failed to touch third base.â) Golfâs rules have been called arcane and it is not unusual to see play stopped while a P.G.A. official arrives with rule book in hand and pronounces in the manner of an I.R.S. official. Both fans and players are aware of how peculiar and âin-houseâ the rules are; knowledge of them is what links the members of a small community, and those outside the community (most people in the world) can be excused if they just donât see what the fuss is about. Plagiarism is like that; itâs an insiderâs obsession. Â If youâre a professional journalist, or an academic historian, or a philosopher, or a social scientist or a scientist, the game Â you play for a living is underwritten by the assumed value of originality and failure properly to credit the work of others is a big and obvious no-no.Â  But if youâre a musician or a novelist, the boundary lines are less clear (although there certainly are some) and if youâre a politician it may not occur to you, as it did not at one time to Joe Biden, that youâre doing anything wrong when you appropriate the speech of a revered statesman. And if youâre a student, plagiarism will seem to be an annoying guild imposition without a persuasive rationaleÂ  (who cares?); for students, learning the rules of plagiarism is worse than learning the irregular conjugations of a foreign language. It takes years, and while a knowledge of irregular verbs might conceivably come in handy if you travel, knowledge of what is and is not plagiarism in this or that professional practice is not something that will be of very much use to you unlessÂ  you end up becoming a member of the profession yourself. Â It follows that students who never quite get the concept right are by and large not committing a crime; they are just failing to become acclimated to the conventions of the little insular world they have, often through no choice of their own, wandered into. Itâs no big moral deal; which doesnât mean, I hasten to add, that plagiarism shouldnât be punished â if youâre in our house, youâve got to play by our rules â just that what youâre punishing is a breach of disciplinary decorum, not a breach of the moral universe. Now if plagiarism is an idea that makes sense only in the precincts of certain specialized practices and is not a normative philosophical notion, inquiries into its philosophical underpinnings Â are of no practical interest or import. In recent years there have been a number of assaults on the notion of originality, issuing from fields as diverse as literary theory, history, cultural studies, philosophy, anthropology, Internet studies. Single authorship, we have been told, is a recent invention of a bourgeois culture obsessed with individualism, individual rights and the myth of progress. All texts are palimpsests of earlier texts; thereâs been nothing new under the sun since Plato and AristotleÂ  and they werenât new either; everything belongs to everybody. In earlier periods works of art were produced in workshops by teams; the master artisan may have signed them, but they were communal products. In some cultures, even contemporary ones, the imitation of standard models is valued more than work that sets out to be path-breaking. (This was one of the positions in the famous quarrel between the ancients and the moderns inÂ  England and France in the 17 th and 18 th centuries.) Arguments like these (which I am reporting, not endorsing) have been so successful in academic circles that the very word âoriginalityâ often appears in quotation marks, and it has seemed to many that there is a direct path from this line of reasoning to the conclusion that plagiarism is an incoherent, even impossible, concept and that a writer or artist accused ofÂ  plagiarism is being faulted for doing something that cannot be avoided. R.M. Howard makes the point succinctly âIf there is no originality and no literary property, there is no basis for the notion ofÂ  plagiarismâ (âCollege English,â 1995). That might be true or at least plausible if, in order to have a basis, plagiarism would have to stand on some philosophical ground. But the ground plagiarism stands on is more mundane and firm; it is the ground of disciplinary practices and of the histories that have conferred on those practices a strong, even undoubted (though revisable)Â  sense of what kind of workÂ  can be appropriately done and what kind of behavior cannot be tolerated. If it is wrong to plagiarize in some context of practice, it is not because the idea of originality has been affirmed by deep philosophical reasoning, but because the ensemble of activities that take place in the practice would be unintelligibleÂ  if Â the possibility of being original Â were not presupposed. And if there should emerge Â a powerful philosophical argument saying thereâs no such thing as originality, its emergence neednât alterÂ  or even bother for a second a practice that can only get started ifÂ  originality is assumed as a baseline. It may be (to offer another example), as I have argued elsewhere, that thereâs no such thing as free speech, but if you want to have a free speech regime because you believe that it is essential to the maintenance of democracy, just forget what Stanley Fish said â after all itâs just a theoretical argument â and get down to it as lawyers and judges in fact do all the time without the benefit or hindrance of any metaphysical rap. Â Everyday disciplinary practices do not rest on a foundation of philosophy or theory; they rest on a foundation of themselves; Â no theory or philosophy can either prop them up or topple them. As long as the practice is ongoing and flourishing its conventions will command respect and allegiance and flouting them will have negative consequences. This brings me back to the (true) story I began with. Whether there is something called originality or not, the two scholars who began their concluding chapter by reproducing two of my pages are professionally culpable.

"","Advertisement  By  The New York Times  How the election and Donald Trump’s victory looks to Opinion writers.  By  Elinor Lipman  * * * *  By  Daniel K. Williams  Donald J. Trump was elected with a higher percentage of the white evangelical vote than any other Republican presidential candidate has ever received, and he has received strong support from prominent Christian Right leaders. Yet if Mr. Trump delivers on his promises, he will not give the religious right what its leaders have traditionally demanded or what the Republican Party platform calls for. Indeed, he will give them very little national legislation at all, but will instead offer them maximum latitude to pursue their agenda at the state level — a shift that may portend a potential breakthrough in the nation’s polarizing culture wars. National legislation has long been the goal of the religious right. When the movement emerged in the late 1970s, evangelical leaders such as Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson sought federal constitutional amendments to ban abortion and restore school prayer, because they wanted to reverse what liberal rights activists had done at the national level through the Supreme Court. In the early 21st century, leaders such as James Dobson continued this trend by persuading   President George W. Bush to endorse a constitutional amendment proposal to define marriage as exclusively heterosexual. In recent years, evangelicals have become so concerned about protecting their own religious liberty against federal mandates or court decisions that they have given less attention to imposing a moral agenda on the rest of the nation. Although the Republican Party platform continues to promise a constitutional amendment protecting human life from the moment of conception, the pro-life movement has not made any serious attempts to pass that amendment since the 1980s. Nor has there been much talk in the last decade of a national ban on same-sex marriage. Mr. Trump is well positioned to promote a further shift away from national moral regulation. For much of his adult life, he held culturally libertarian views on abortion and gay rights, and he evinced little interest in the religious right’s agenda. Early in his campaign, he expressed discomfort with conservative evangelicals’ opposition to the rights of transgender people to use the public restroom of their choice. But he quickly came to embrace a “states’ rights” position on same-sex marriage and transgender rights, a position that would allow culturally liberal New Yorkers the right to pursue different policies than cultural conservatives in Mississippi or North Dakota. And while Mr. Trump stumbled over abortion during his campaign, the policy that he ultimately reverted to was to leave abortion legalization up to the states — an outcome that he would try to ensure by nominating conservative Supreme Court justices who might overturn Roe v. Wade. Mr. Trump has gone further than any previous Republican presidential nominee in a generation in insisting that the religious right should enact its agenda at the state, rather than federal, level.  Although this was the policy position of many Republicans during the 1970s (including President Gerald Ford), religious right activists persuaded the G.O.P. in the early 1980s to abandon its states-rights approach to abortion and other social issues, and promise national legislation to implement the religious right’s agenda. Mr. Trump is leading the party back to its more traditional stance. While many liberals will find this outcome unsatisfactory — since it offers them no opportunity to secure national protection for individual rights that they consider inalienable — it may be the only compromise solution that can give both conservatives and liberals the freedom to pursue their own agenda at the local level without fear of a national backlash. If a socially libertarian New Yorker can deliver this compromise to the conservative white rural evangelical voters who put him in office, both conservatives and liberals should see that for what it is: a landmark opportunity to move beyond the culture wars.  By  Marwan Bishara  Just when the people of the Middle East thought things couldn’t get any worse, Donald J. Trump is elected president of the United States. Now, their apprehension about the president-elect dwarfs their disappointment with President Obama. It could be a blessing in disguise. America, in one magic moment, you’ve revealed how you’ve changed. For the worse. Poor you, you feel so insecure, vulnerable and fragile. Like the rest of us. So, instead of reaching for your famed “can-do” spirit, lifting yourselves up by the bootstraps, you turned to a strident, bellicose type of nationalism. The kind usually associated with strutting generalissimos of Third World nations with their chests covered with made-up, self-awarded medals. Maybe the people of the Middle East will look and realize that you are no longer the Great Democracy to emulate. That your modern style of empire and your role as keeper of the world order for the world’s own good are stumbling and failing, even in your own eyes; and that we in the Middle East should not be turning to you for rescue. For as long as I can remember, you’ve been on a self-assigned mission to change the Middle East. Indeed, the world. Now, it seems as if the change has flowed the other way. You’ve voted to reduce your liberties. To narrow the range of people entitled to justice and equality before the law. To live in a place where the police should not be criticized; where fighting political correctness is more important than fighting racism; where Muslims are suspected and people who appear Hispanic can be rounded up if they’re not carrying their papers. In this election you’ve revealed that your people — like Russians, Hungarians, Iraqis, Iranians and others whose politics you normally look down on — will choose a narrow, nonsensical nationalist ethos when they feel threatened by uncertainty. Your imperial outreach allowed you to experience other cultures, but now you’ve chosen to shrink your outlook, with the expectation that the world will continue to revolve around you. It won’t. Like the rest of us, you’re now divided between those who want to make their nation great again alone and those who want to make it great together. O.K., enough about you; let’s talk about us. We in the Middle East can’t decipher what exactly your incoming president wants from us. I don’t think he knows, either. Mr. Trump said he would bring back torture and ban Muslims from entering America, and he compared the threat of “radical Islam” to Soviet Communism. He wants less engagement in the region, and fewer “free riders” like the Saudis who don’t pay enough for American protection. And he wants the United States to abandon the costly nation-building in the Middle East. What nation-building? In Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Yemen, Libya and Somalia, civil wars continue unabated. The Arab and Muslim worlds only hope the United States stops contributing to the destruction.
Mr. Trump does not exactly seem concerned for the wishes of Middle Easterners and their right to live in peace. It sounds more like what he really wants to do is pal around with other strutting, authoritarian types. Expect him to cozy up to Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, and join him in supporting Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad. Expect America’s new president to work closely with Egypt’s president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, and Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. Mr. Trump has embraced Mr. Netanyahu’s positions on Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and on abandoning the two-state solution. Instead of Americanizing the Middle East, Mr. Trump seems set on “Israelizing” America, stirring fear of Muslims and trying to wall out “the other.” Arabs, and Middle Easterners in general, should take one quick look and figure out how to be less dependent on the United States, and how to resolve their conflicts within their own, regional frameworks.
Finally, some good news. President Obama has assured us that the sun will rise tomorrow, regardless. And if the Trump presidency is as bad as I expect it to be — though not so bad that it demolishes democracy entirely — he can be voted out in four years. Meanwhile, fasten your seatbelts. It’s going to be a hell of a ride.  By  Carol Giacomo  A commitment to human rights has been a fundamental precept of NATO since the alliance was created a half century ago. You would not expect that a founding member would have to be reminded of that fact. Certainly not the United States, for all those years the leader of NATO and an inspirational embodiment of its core values. Yet this is where we find ourselves now, the day after Donald Trump won the presidency: In congratulating him on his victory, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany felt compelled to set conditions for cooperation. “Germany and America are connected by values of democracy, freedom and respect for the law and the dignity of man, independent of origin, skin color, religion, gender, sexual orientation or political views,” she said in a statement, adding: “I offer the next President of the United States close cooperation on the basis of these values.” Mr. Trump’s behavior during his campaign was antithetical to those values. He has threatened to ban Muslims from the United States, refuse refugees, deport 11 million undocumented workers and build a wall on the border with Mexico. He has disparaged African Americans, Mexican Americans, women and people with disabilities. Moreover, Mr. Trump has called into question America’s commitment to NATO and displayed a befuddling penchant for defending Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, who is waging war in eastern Ukraine and destabilizing other parts of Europe by supporting far-right groups. He received no pushback on Wednesday from Theresa May, the British prime minister, who simply congratulated Mr. Trump on his win. The two leaders’ reactions were further proof that, after Britain’s decision to leave the European Union, we will have to look to Mrs. Merkel not just to lead Europe but to replace America in leading NATO as well.  By  Gil Troy  “I am scared that if Ronald Reagan gets into office, we are going to see more of the Ku Klux Klan and a resurgence of the Nazi Party,” Coretta Scott King said in November, 1980. “I’m afraid things are going to blow sky high during this next term,” a nursing student said. He’s a “nitwit,” added a Democrat. “He’s shallow, superficial and frightening,” one of that year’s historic numbers of “undecideds” insisted. Ronald Reagan “seems not to relish complexity and subtlety,” the New York Times editorial endorsing President Jimmy Carter’s re-election proclaimed. “The problem is not a loose lip but the simple answer.”  While fearing what Reagan’s own running mate, George H.W. Bush, had dismissed as Reagan’s “voodoo economics” during their primary fight, the editorial board feared “voodoo diplomacy,” too. From coast to coast, half of a divided nation abhorred —  and underestimated — the president-elect. “The American people,“ Hamilton Jordan, a key Carter aide, said, "are not going to elect a 70-year-old, right-wing, ex-movie actor to be president.” Pollsters reported in 1980 that “More voters held negative attitudes toward each presidential candidate than in any campaign since polling began” — a record we just broke in 2016. The economic dislocation of galloping inflation and the energy crisis produced a nasty campaign. Feeling neglected by Washington, millions embraced Ronald Reagan’s populism. Despite the Democratic panic, Ronald Reagan left America richer and safer after two terms as president. Reagan defied expectations by turning toward the center. He acted as president of the United States, not president of the Republican Party. Reagan used the transition period to heal wounds while claiming a broad policy mandate, despite winning only 50.7 percent of the popular vote. He vowed to “rebuild a bipartisan base for American foreign policy.” His cabinet choices were so moderate that Pat Buchanan, the conservative flamethrower whose rhetorical bluster anticipated the advent of Donald Trump, lamented: “Where is the dash, color, and controversy — the customary concomitants of a Reagan campaign?” Just weeks into Reagan’s first term, conservatives were demanding that his aides had to “Let Reagan be Reagan,” meaning: stop being so reasonable. But in adjusting, in tempering, Reagan was being Reagan. He knew the Constitution limited presidential powers — and he faced a Democratic Congress led by the formidable speaker of the House Tip O’Neill to remind him further. Illustrating Richard Neustadt’s lesson that the power of the president is mostly “the power to persuade,” many of Reagan’s achievements were symbolic. Rather than shrinking government as he promised, for example, he only lowered the federal government’s growth rate. History is not destiny. And Reagan had both a lighter touch than Mr. Trump, and eight years’ experience as  governor of California. Still, history is full of shifts and surprises. Mr. Trump must be a healer and unite America, as he tried doing in his victory speech. If he fails, the checks and balances that sometimes help crusading ideologues become effective leaders can ultimately impose a necessary gridlock. When asked about conservatives’ frustration with him, Reagan kindly insisted it was only a “very few” critics. He said: “There are some people who think that you should, on principle, jump off the cliff with the flag flying if you can’t get everything you want.” Reagan recalled that “If I found when I was governor that I could not get 100 percent of what I asked for, I took 80 percent.” So far, Mr. Trump, the political amateur and sputtering demagogue, has lacked Reagan’s magnanimity or his flexibility. Can the reality-show star turned president-elect mimic the actor turned president?  By  James R. Jones  In 1968, there was a demand among voters for change, especially regarding Vietnam and foreign policy, and there was a backlash against some of the Great Society programs. Then, as now, the Democratic candidate was tied to the departing administration and hamstrung to differentiate a new set of policies. As a result, the Democratic presidential nominee, Hubert H. Humphrey, narrowly lost to the Republican, Richard M. Nixon, a candidate who was despised by a large percentage of the electorate. One positive outcome of that election was the first organized transition from the departing to incoming governments. President Lyndon B. Johnson always believed that, after an election, Democrats and Republicans should come together to do what’s right for the country. At the time, I was President Johnson’s appointments secretary, the position that has since evolved into the White House chief of staff. Right after the 1968 results came in, the president put me in charge of organizing a transition process, something that had never been done. “Nixon is an S.O.B., but he’s the only president we’ll have,” Johnson told me. “I want him and all of his team to be fully prepared to govern after the Inauguration at 12 noon on January 20.” A few days later, Johnson and Nixon met at the White House along with Nixon’s top advisers, including H. R. Haldeman and John Mitchell. There we mapped out a program in which all of the Johnson cabinet and major White House staff members would brief their incoming counterparts as often as was desired by the new administration. My charge was to work with Haldeman, who became my successor at the White House, to make sure these briefings occurred across the new administration and in a timely fashion. One surprise was that Nixon told me that Mitchell could speak for him in all matters if he was not available. Johnson would have never delegated such authority, but that was the difference in the management style of the two men. While a smooth transition was important to Johnson, he didn’t stop being president. He was issuing orders and making appointments right up to the morning of the Inauguration. In fact, the day before the Inauguration the president told me to find out how many vacancies existed on commissions and boards and find good people that he could nominate. He kept Nixon waiting in the Blue Room on Inauguration morning while he signed those nominations (which required Senate confirmation) and had them delivered to the Congress before noon. It is a positive sign that President Obama invited Donald J. Trump to meet at the White House two days after this most contentious election. Today transitions are much more institutional now than our first one in 1968. But this process can heal many wounds and start bringing our country closer together. That’s imperative if we want to make our government work for the people again. Back in 1968, Johnson and Nixon left the White House together, along with Senator Everett Dirksen and me. We jumped into the car and headed to the Capitol. Surprisingly, Nixon wanted only to discuss how disappointed he was to have lost Texas (Johnson’s home state) and how determined he was to win it in1972. I hope the ride to the Capitol next January will be more substantive on policy.  By  Sarah Jaffe  If anything has been made clear by the results of this election, it is that the political and pundit class have underestimated the degree of anger and pain in the United States, the degree to which “recovery” has been recovery for a few and stagnation and decline for many more. One exit poll has been haunting me since I saw it: The Reuters/Ipsos early exit poll found that 75 percent of respondents agreed “America needs a strong leader to take the country back from the rich and powerful.” Only slightly fewer agreed that “the American economy is rigged to advantage the rich and powerful,” and — perhaps the kicker — 68 percent believed that “traditional parties and politicians don’t care about people like me.” There’s a lot to unpack in those statements. They may conceal white resentment of the perceived advancement past them of black and Latino people. But they also reveal the sentiment that has been there since the 2008 financial crisis laid bare the lines of power in the country and the world — when, as the protest chant went, “Banks got bailed out, we got sold out.” The downward trends have been with us for decades: the divergence of productivity gains from workers’ incomes, the substitution of credit card debt for raises, the shift of good union jobs and family wages and pensions into low-wage service jobs, and the attendant slashing of the social safety net. But the past eight years sped all that up and made it impossible to ignore. If Donald J. Trump stood out to voters from the rest of the Republican Party, aside from a willingness to say directly the kinds of things usually carefully dogwhistled, it was in his rants about trade and his lack of interest in dismantling the remnants of the welfare state. For white Americans anxiously looking at their disappearing stability, Mr. Trump was a bomb they were willing to throw at a system they felt was failing them. He emotionally echoed their outrage and gave them a place to direct their anger, the age-old right-wing populist trick of refracting it both upward at elites and downward at minorities. Hillary Clinton’s campaign and the mainstream Democratic Party were woefully unprepared to greet this wave. When your response to a cry of “Make America Great Again!” is “America Is Already Great!” you’d better be sure that it feels true to a majority of voters. The results show that it did not. To be sure, Democrats had an uneasy line to walk, between maintaining continuity with a still-popular, twice-elected Barack Obama — a continuity that won Mrs. Clinton the Democratic primary — and reaching the people who wanted and needed change. But the party’s wholehearted backing of Mrs. Clinton was a colossal misreading of a moment when rage at the establishment (of both parties) was simmering everywhere. That rage should have been visible as Mr. Trump ran away with the Republican nomination process despite the opposition of that party’s grandees, and as Bernie Sanders pushed Mrs. Clinton much harder than anyone had expected a gray-haired socialist from Vermont to do. But Mrs. Clinton opened her arms to disaffected Republicans rather than wooing the disaffected within and around her own party. Most of the television ads she ran were more about painting Trump as a dangerous aberration, an outsider unfit for office, than pitching any plan of her own for change. Democrats failed to realize that for many Trump voters, that was exactly what they liked about him.  By  Will Wilkinson  It may not be an exaggeration to say that Donald Trump both knows and cares less about the details of public policy than anyone ever elected president of the United States. This just goes to show that “politics is not about policy,” as Robin Hanson, the futurist and social theorist, likes to say. Mr. Trump’s playbook against Hillary Clinton broke with the hard-won norms of liberal democracy, went back to demagogic, authoritarian political basics, and updated them for  the reality television, social media age. Politics is, at bottom, about factions vying and coordinating to choose leaders in whom to invest authority. Throughout the campaign, Mr. Trump displayed an uncanny and unnerving mastery of the primal politics of authority, and the game of legitimizing his own and delegitimizing his rivals’ claims to authority. In Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump drew a general election opponent pre-weakened by a decades-long Republican campaign of delegitimization. He took advantage of it with shameless audacity, making the most of our culture’s lingering sexism and the popular perception of Mrs. Clinton as a member of an arrogant and corrupt elite that believes it is above the law. But tearing down his opponents was only half of Trump’s equation. The pundits and pollsters so badly botched their predictions in no small part because they failed to grasp the intense, reality-distorting power of Donald Trump’s fame. But Mr. Trump seems to have an intuitive understanding that glamour, celebrity and gaudy wealth are key ingredients in majesty — which is inherently authoritative and underwrites its own claim to legitimacy. Trump’s self-branded personal jet was more than a convenient means of transportation for a very rich man. It was a purple silk, ermine-fringed cape, Air Force One in waiting, and he knew how to use it. The United States, the world’s first nation founded on principled opposition to the pre-Enlightenment politics of majesty and unified authority, has deep-seated norms of republican modesty and propriety. Casting those norms aside and banking heavily on the atavistic political appeal of majestic celebrity gave Mr. Trump an advantage few us were prepared to acknowledge, allowing him to attract the support of an unforeseen numbers of black, Hispanic and female voters, despite his campaign’s naked racism and his scandalously misogynistic and abusive personal history. Because Mr. Trump’s strategy was so indifferent to matters of policy substance, it is incredibly difficult to say what policies Mr. Trump will actually support in office. I don’t think we’ve ever known less about what an incoming president really wants to do with his power. But we do have a clear indication of how he’s likely to wield it. He will cleverly burnish his claim to authority and relentlessly and effectively discredit his opponents, inside and outside the Republican Party, with all the tools of an executive branch that has never been more powerful and less constrained by the constitutional system America’s founders designed specifically as an alternative to and a bulwark against unitary authority.  By  Lindy West  I got up on Election Day and burst into tears — not a genteel twin trickle but a great heaving burst, zero to firehose. Tears spattered the inside of my glasses, dripped from my lips, and left mascara-tinged rosettes blooming black in my cereal milk. “Honey,” my husband crooned to me. “Honey, it’s going to be O.K. The numbers are still good. It’s O.K.” But it wasn’t the numbers. I wasn’t sobbing because I was afraid Hillary Clinton was going to lose. That would come later. I was sobbing Tuesday morning because, as I poured my coffee, I’d caught a glimpse of a cable news interview with Mrs. Clinton just after she voted for herself in Chappaqua, N.Y. She seemed breathless, exhilarated, a little overwhelmed. Over her shoulder, Bill Clinton stared at his wife and beamed. My husband stares at me like that sometimes. It’s not just love — we expect husbands to love their wives — but something less traditional, more conditional and gendered. It’s professional respect. It’s pride. We’re accustomed to that pride flowing the other direction, from wife to husband, because men in our culture get to be more than just bodies, do more than just nurture. Men get to act and excel and climb and aspire and thrive and win and rule and be the audacious, hungry fulcrum of public life. It is normal for men to have ambition. It is normal for women to stand aside. I thought about Bill Clinton meeting Hillary Rodham at Yale in 1971, and how tenacious and intense she must have been even back then, how undeniable and potent. Mr. Clinton describes the moment in his memoir . “She conveyed a sense of strength and self-possession I had rarely seen in anyone, man or woman,“ he wrote. "She was in my face from the start.” He says he once told her , during those years, “I have met all the most gifted people in our generation and you’re the best.” And then I thought about Mr. Clinton rising steadily through his political career, on the track we have built for charismatic, competent white men. He must have known, every second, how good his wife was. Not just good, but “the best.” Better than everyone he’d ever met; better than him, even. And he watched her stand next to him and wait, and wait, and wait, underestimated and degraded and excoriated for wanting more out of life than cookies. And she didn’t quit! She swallowed slander and humiliation and irrational hatred for three decades and she didn’t quit, and here she was, just a hair’s breadth from the presidency of the United States — the first woman ever to be trusted with the rudder of the world. He must be so proud of her, I thought. It made me cry. I cried because I want my daughters to feel that blazing pride, that affirmation of their boundless capacity — not from their husbands, but from their world, from the atmosphere, from inviolable wells of certainty inside themselves. I cried because it’s not fair, and I’m so tired, and every woman I know is so tired. I cried because I don’t even know what it feels like to be taken seriously — not fully, not in that whole, unequivocal, confident way that’s native to handshakes between men. I cried because it does things to you to always come second. Whatever your personal opinion of the Clintons, as politicians or as human beings, that dynamic is real. We, as a culture, do not take women seriously on a profound level. We do not believe women. We do not trust women. We do not like women. I understand that many men cannot see it, and plenty more do not care. I know that many men will read this and laugh, or become defensive, or call me hysterical, or worse, and that’s fine. I am used to it. It doesn’t make me wrong. But maybe this election was the beginning of something new, I thought. Not the death of sexism, but the birth of a world in which women’s inferiority isn’t a given. That grain of hope glowed inside me until around dinner time on Tuesday, the final day of an election so openly misogynist that the question “Sexual assault: good or bad?” was credulously presented for debate. Today doesn’t feel real. It is indistinguishable from fresh, close grief. But if there’s one lesson we can take from Mrs. Clinton, politics aside — and even Donald Trump acknowledged it in the second debate — it’s the limitlessness of human endurance. Those of us who have been left in the cold by this apparent affirmation of a white supremacist patriarchy (and sorry, white women who voted for Mr. Trump, but your shelter is illusory) are tough. We have been weathering this hurricane wall of doubt and violence for so long, and now, more crystalline than ever, we have an enemy and a mandate. We have the smirking apotheosis of our oppression sliming, paw-first, toward our genitals. We have the popular vote. We have proof, in exit polls, that white women will pawn their humanity for the safety of white supremacy. We have abortion pills to stockpile and neighbors to protect and children to teach. We have the right woman to find. We have local elections in a year. The fact that we lost doesn’t make us wrong; the fact that they don’t believe in us doesn’t make us disappear.  By  Seth Grossman  A couple of years ago, I produced a reality-TV show called “Hollywood Hillbillies,” about a family from rural Georgia who, driven by the grandson’s newfound internet fame, moves west to make it in Hollywood. The show centered on the undeniable charisma of “Mema,” the foul-mouthed matriarch who spoke her mind and poked fun at the habits and attitudes of the Los Angeles elite. The show was part of a wave of “redneck reality” shows like “Swamp People,” “Duck Dynasty,” “Bayou Billionaires” and “Moonshiners” that presented a vision of white, rural America as the last authentic place on earth, the last place untarnished by the corruption and cynicism of the elites. “Hollywood Hillbillies” aired on the Reelz Network, a channel owned by a billionaire Republican donor Stanley Hubbard , who funded a pro-Trump “super” PAC after his preferred candidates lost the primaries. Designed as a harmless comedy, the show reveled in Mema’s provocative, off-color remarks, just as Donald J. Trump’s audience revels in his. But now I’m thinking more critically about what shows like this are selling. All of these shows have one thing in common: While trafficking in rural stereotypes, they celebrate wealth and business success — whether that business is crafting hick-hop music, catching alligators or designing duck calls. Ostensibly produced for middle America, they offer a population disenfranchised by globalization and the information economy a vision of rural ingenuity rewarded. Mr. Trump based his candidacy around this population. He spoke directly to voters raised on reality TV, addressing their fears and aspirations with blunt talk. He became their perfect celebrity champion, a rich white man, his image polished by years in a reality-TV boardroom, who validated their demographic anxiety. In an election season driven more by hatred of political opponents than enthusiasm for two deeply unpopular candidates, President-Elect Donald J. Trump hated best, and won. I am wondering today if the same embarrassment that prevents some of us from admitting that we watch “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” also kept Trump supporters from admitting to pollsters that they were voting for a man they knew the media considered a bigot. Two months ago, I started working on a new series, “Trumpigration,” a travel show about where to move if Donald Trump somehow got elected. That, too, was designed as a lighthearted comedy. Now, facing the prospect of four years of a Trump presidency, it’s beginning to feel like the last chance to change the channel.  By  Roberto Suro  If you are in shock over the election results, don’t blame Latinos. They favored Hillary Clinton by better than two to one, according to the exit polls. They did not turn out in big numbers to protest Donald J. Trump, but it probably would not have mattered. It turns out that Latinos were the election’s biggest losers and not just because Mr. Trump won the presidency after a long campaign of slinging threats and insults at them. The bitterest loss was dealt by the 59.5 million mostly white people who voted for Mr. Trump. That was a rejection by their own countrymen. According to the exit polls — a rough measure of turnout at best — Latinos accounted for 11 percent of the votes cast Tuesday the same as 2012. If those numbers hold, there was little or no Trump effect, and however much the number of Latino votes increased was just a result of demography. You may have been convinced that it would be otherwise. Years of reckless commentary, news stories and advocacy insisted that Latinos would be the great demographic firewall that would safeguard progressive politics with surging population numbers. But, the firewall only stands in a few states, and the biggest of them, California, New York and Texas, are already decided. Mr. Trump concentrated instead on the old industrial states where Latinos are a sparse presence. When he demonized Mexico and unauthorized immigrants, he gained more in the Electoral College by mobilizing white voters than he lost by alienating Latinos. The national exit polls show that Mrs. Clinton drew 65 percent of the Latino vote compared with 29 percent for Mr. Trump. That is a landslide by any measure, and it is about the same margin in the exit polls for 2008 (67 percent vs. 31 percent). The disappointment sets in when you compare the outcome to 2012. President Barack Obama took 71 percent of the Latino vote in the exit polls that year compared with 27 percent for Mitt Romney. Mr. Trump was supposed to be the bucket of cold water that aroused the sleeping giant, producing not only a stronger preference for the Democratic candidate but also, more important, a spike in turnout. In 2012, with immigration reform on the line, more than 12 million Latino voters stayed home, producing a turnout rate of 48 percent compared with 64 percent for whites and 67 percent for blacks. The much ballyhooed and chronicled “Trump Effect” was supposed to have produced a surge in naturalizations and voter registration over the past year, and news organizations were churning out stories about the “surge” in Latino voting even after the polls closed Tuesday. While more time and data is needed to get a full picture of Latino turnout this year, at first glance it appears Latino numbers were up, and perhaps significantly in some places, but that in fact the giant was barely stirred. Four million more Latinos were eligible to vote Tuesday than in 2012. So, no matter who was running and no matter how low the turnout, the number of Latino votes counted Tuesday was virtually certain to be higher than 2012. In fact, demographic growth alone would have guaranteed Mrs. Clinton an additional 1.3 million votes (about 1 percent of the total votes cast), even if turnout remained at the same dismal rate as 2012, and she got two-thirds of the Latino votes. In Colorado and Nevada, Latino voters surely helped keep the states blue, and under different scenarios those states could have served as the much-advertised Latino firewall. The one real bright spot for Latino Democrats Tuesday came with the election of Catherine Cortez Masto to the Senate in Nevada. That vote may illustrate what it takes to wake up the Latino electorate: a charismatic and qualified candidate, strong mediating institutions, in this case the hospitality workers’ unions in Las Vegas, and well-organized political operation like the one created by Senator Harry Reid, the retiring Democratic leader. Meanwhile, something may have happened in Texas that needs a closer look. Mr. Trump won handily, but only by a 9 percent margin. President Obama lost the state by nearly 16 points in 2012 and by almost 12 points in 2008. A lot of non-Latino newcomers have begun to change the political complexion of the state in recent years, and that formula — newcomers plus Latinos — is what flipped Colorado and Nevada in the past. Florida is the one place where Latinos might have been able to change the results of this election and didn’t. In the exit polls, Latinos accounted for 18 percent of the total vote compared with 17 in 2012, and the split was slightly more favorable to Mrs. Clinton than it was for President Obama four years ago. Mrs. Clinton’s vote tally was more than 200,000 higher than President Obama’s, but Mr. Trump’s was more than 400,000 higher than Mr. Romney’s. And therein lies the result that Latinos will have to live with for the next four years. In a state that has vividly benefited from immigration and trade, a state where Latinos have for the most part prospered and contributed to the prosperity of their neighbors, white voters mobilized to elect a candidate who would angrily erase everything Latinos represent. No one else suffered that kind of defeat on Tuesday.  By  Kevin M. Kruse  With so many predictions about this presidential campaign having turned out to be so very wrong, comparisons to the 1948 presidential race come naturally. In that election, virtually everyone predicted that the Republican Thomas Dewey would beat the “accidental president,” the Democrat, Harry Truman. Pollsters reinforced these assumptions. Elmer Roper announced that he was so sure Dewey would win that he wouldn’t even bother reporting poll results anymore. “My silence on this point can be construed as an indication that Mr. Dewey is still so clearly ahead that we might as well just listen to his inaugural address,” he said. George Gallup kept polling until mid-October, but then rested on those results, assuming the race was over. Pundits agreed. Newsweek surveyed 50 of the nation’s top political reporters in October; every single one said Dewey would win. Republicans and Democrats alike assumed the race was over. On election night, the conservative Chicago Tribune was so confident it called the race early, rushing out a banner headline that would soon be as famous as it was wrong: “Dewey Defeats Truman.” To the amazement of nearly everyone, Truman won by considerable margins. In the popular vote, he took 49.6 percent to Dewey’s 45.1 percent. In the Electoral College, he won 303 votes to Dewey’s 189. While the margins of this year’s election are narrower, the shock and confusion of pollsters and analysts seems just as pronounced. But comparisons between the Truman and Trump campaigns are not neatly drawn. Truman was an outspoken liberal, and he campaigned on preserving and expanding the accomplishments of the New Deal welfare state. He called for expansion of Social Security, more progressive forms of taxation, a higher minimum wage, and a new national system of health insurance. Truman also committed the Democratic Party, long dominated by Southern segregationists, to a new racial liberalism. Notably, he called on Congress to protect the voting rights of African-Americans. In foreign policy, Truman set America against the growing influence of the Soviet Union. In 1947, he announced the Truman Doctrine, which prompted economic aid to Europe through the Marshall Plan and military alliances through a new North Atlantic Treaty Organization. A year later, Truman challenged Soviet expansionism with the Berlin Airlift. Mr. Trump has rejected much of the substance of Truman’s campaign, but in many ways he reflected its style. Truman’s famous “whistle-stop campaign” took him to rural communities and small towns where working-class and middle-class whites felt neglected. In fiery speeches with blunt language, he singled out sources of blame. Truman went after the “do nothing” Republican Congress as a prominent foe, but also denounced an array of “special interests,” including “bloodsuckers who have offices on Wall Street.” Truman named these enemies and promised to “give ’em’ hell.” His crowds believed him and rallied to their candidate. On Election Day, he predicted there were would be “a lot of surprised pollsters.” There were. Though he had reason to gloat, Truman was gracious in victory. The day after the election, the Washington Post staff invited him to a “crow banquet.” All the newspaper pundits, radio commentators and pollsters who predicted his defeat would wear sackcloth and force down a main course of crow; the president, in white tie and tails, would be served roast turkey. Truman declined, saying he had “no desire to crow over anybody or to see anybody eat crow, figuratively or otherwise.” He added, “We should all get together now and make a country in which everybody can eat turkey whenever he pleases.” Mr. Trump is not a politician who operates by anyone else’s playbook, but perhaps in this small but important matter, he can take a lesson from history.  By  Maureen Sullivan  I have to admit it: I am loving it. As the results poured in for Donald J. Trump, I reveled in the Facebook friends who openly mourned the end of humanity. I felt gleeful in trolling the Twitter hashtag #HesNotMyPresident: “I’m laying in bed with tears streaming down my face, just thinking about the future of this country.” This was one of the biggest election upsets in history, so of course everyone is stunned. Me too. Switching among three cable news networks and several websites I wondered: Is he really going to take Florida so easily? Did they just call North Carolina for Trump? Can he possibly win Wisconsin? Pennsylvania? Yup. I rooted for Mitt Romney in 2012 and John McCain in 2008. I ran for the school board in Hoboken, N.J., and lost once before winning the following year. I know what it’s like to have your hopes puddle up on the floor like that dollop of election-night Haagen-Dazs that you dropped and you just don’t care to wipe up. What does it matter? All is lost. You want to announce on Twitter that you are in bed letting the tears stream down your face. I saw this result coming over the summer. In July, five police officers were ambushed in Dallas and three more were killed in Baton Rouge. In August, Colin Kaepernick, the San Francisco 49ers quarterback, sat out the national anthem. In September, an Islamic terrorist, masquerading as a fried chicken salesman in my hometown, Elizabeth, N.J., set off bombs in New York and New Jersey. Mrs. Clinton proclaimed: “I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police.” She put half of Trump’s supporters in that “basket of deplorables.” People I know were angry. They were tired of being told they were racist and bigoted as they went about the business of mowing their lawns, writing college tuition checks and working their jobs as cops, secretaries and teachers’ aides. They kept being told they needed to look inward, examine their sins and judge themselves guilty. They had not forgotten when Barack Obama was running for president in 2008 and his wife, Michelle, said, “For the first time in my adult lifetime, I’m really proud of my country…” So now we have President-Elect Donald Trump. I supported him because he promised to curb regulations, cut taxes and appoint constitutionalists to the Supreme Court. I supported him because Mrs. Clinton doesn’t have what it takes to turn around a stagnant economy or stand up to the special interests that block innovation. In his victory speech, Mr. Trump lifted a line from Abraham Lincoln and spoke of “binding wounds.” I wanted him to be gracious and kind in that moment, and he was. My 89-year-old mother is still appalled by my vote and tells me, with a laugh, that she’s moving to Ireland. And one of my disappointed female friends on Facebook — who, like me is white and college-educated — wrote, “Obama helped expose the deeply racist nature of our country. Trump exposes the anti-intellectual, sexist xenophobia.” But most of my friends, some of whom I suspect cast votes like mine, have stayed quiet. I guess it’s still not politically correct to admit that you are on the Trump train.  By  Viet Thanh Nguyen  Worst-case scenario in the next four years: fascism, a wall, mass deportations, the end of Obamacare, a Trump brand on the White House and either a trade war or an actual war with China (since war is the easiest diversion from domestic unhappiness). Best-case scenario: Ruth Bader Ginsburg refuses to retire or die, the Democratic Party finds a backbone, turns away from its fixation on the center and heeds the call for an economic revolt against the 1 percent, joined by Black Lives Matter, the Occupy movement, and resurgent feminism. Both scenarios could happen at the same time. The second scenario requires Democrats to put their status quo political model to rest. They already had a significant portion of the nonwhite minority vote locked up, but have lost too many working-class white people. Bernie Sanders might not have won over the wealthier whites who were voting with Trump against the seemingly rising tide of minorities, but he might have snared the white working class and some of the white middle class. Here’s the bright side, for those, like me, who are on the liberal-to-left spectrum. If Hillary Clinton had won, she would have run again in 2020, which could have meant four more years of Wall Street liberalism and fire-and-forget perpetual warfare, conducted by drones and Special Operations over the horizon. Now perhaps Elizabeth Warren will be the 2020 Democratic candidate — a white woman, a feminist, and someone more progressive than Clinton. But all this speaks largely about domestic electoral politics. The sickness of the American body politic remains untreated, and will remain untreated, or exacerbated, in a country run by clowns, conspirators, and collaborators. That sickness is imperialism. America is an imperial country, and its decay might now be showing. The power that has brought so much benefit to the country — for white people — is now faltering in its ability to provide those benefits to all white people. The empire’s best hope is to be more inclusive, demographically and economically, but that runs counter to the imperial impulse to hoard power and profit. Warren or someone like her might be better at extracting more social and economic justice for all Americans. But unless such a person finds a way to ease control from the financial-industrial complex, the prospects of halting our decline are weak. Empires rot from the inside even as emperors blame the barbarians.  By  Robert N. Stavins  Donald J. Trump once tweeted that “the concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing noncompetitive.” Twitter messages may not be clear signs of likely public policies, but Mr. Trump followed up during the campaign with his “America First Energy Plan,” which would rescind all of President Obama’s actions on climate change. The plan includes canceling United States participation in the Paris climate agreement and stopping all American funding of United Nations climate change programs. It also includes abandoning the Clean Power Plan, a mainstay of the Obama administration’s approach to achieving its emissions reduction target for carbon dioxide under the Paris agreement. What should we make of such campaign promises? Taking Mr. Trump at his word, he will surely seek to pull the country out of the Paris pact. But because the agreement has already come into force, under the rules, any party must wait three years before requesting to withdraw, followed by a one-year notice period. Those rules would seem to be mere technicalities. The incoming Trump administration simply can disregard America’s pledge to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 26 to 28 percent below the 2005 level by 2025. That is bad enough. But the big worry is what other key countries, including the world’s largest emitter, China, as well as India and Brazil, will do if the United States reneges on its pledge. The result could be that the Paris agreement unravels, taking it from the 97 percent of global emissions currently covered by the pact to little more than the European Union’s 10 percent share. In addition, Mr. Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency probably will stop work on regulations of methane emissions (a very potent greenhouse gas) from existing oil and gas operations. Undoing complex existing regulations, such as the Clean Power Plan, will be more difficult, but a reconstituted Supreme Court will probably help President Trump when that plan inevitably comes before the court. Also, the new president will most likely ask that the Keystone XL pipeline permit application be renewed — and facilitate other oil and gas pipelines around the country. On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump promised to “bring back” the coal industry by cutting environmental regulations. That may not be so easy. The decline of that industry and related employment has been caused by technological changes in mining, and competition from low-priced natural gas for electricity generation, not by environmental regulations. At the same time, Mr. Trump has pledged to promote fracking for oil and gas, but that would make natural gas even more economically attractive, and accelerate the elimination of coal-sector jobs. If he lives up to his campaign rhetoric, Mr. Trump may indeed be able to reverse course on climate change policy, increasing the threat to our planet, and in the process destroy much of the Obama legacy in this important realm. This will make the states even more important players on this critical issue.  By  Dani Rodrik  The real costs of a Donald J. Trump presidency will most likely come on the political rather than on the economic side. We are likely to see some rise in trade barriers and unilateral economic policies. But for all his bluster, I do not expect Mr. Trump to engage in indiscriminate protectionism. We live in a world of supply chains where imposing tariffs on Mexican or Chinese imports will raise costs of United States businesses and make it hard for them to compete. Mr. Trump is a businessman, and he will understand soon, if he does not now, the senselessness of blanket protectionism. We may have plenty of trade disputes with foreign countries. It’s useful to bear in mind here the example of the 1980s, when trade frictions with Japan and other leading exporters produced a slew of so-called new protectionist barriers such as voluntary export restraints. But these did very limited damage to the world economy. Before long, the world embarked on a further and more intense round of globalization. Furthermore, we have robust international institutions, like the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization, that did not exist in the interwar period. And the political lobbies in favor of an open economy (big business and banks) are stronger and retain considerable influence in Washington. So even though the 1930s parallel is on everyone’s mind, I do not think we are in for a collapse of the international economic order and a retreat into trade war. The real danger Mr. Trump poses is the undermining of our politics — the norms that sustain our liberal democracies. His campaign was based on a divisive politics of identity. Ideals of equity, equal rights, diversity and inclusion were submerged under the weight of a rhetoric that raised racial and ethnic tensions and inflamed passions against imagined enemies — Mexican immigrants, Chinese exporters, Muslim refugees. Illiberal democracy has been the bane of several nations around the world. Under Mr. Trump, the traditions in the United States of checks and balances and of rule of law will be tested seriously. The political danger will be greatly magnified by Mr. Trump’s likely economic failure. He comes into office as the putative leader of middle and lower classes who feel they have been left behind. He has raised their expectations in ways that he cannot meet. There is little chance that incomes at the middle and lower end of income distribution will receive a large boost under his policies. The manufacturing jobs that have left will not return no matter how tough Mr. Trump’s trade policies get. These jobs have disappeared for good, largely thanks to technological changes, and not trade. When the full scale of his economic disappointment sinks in sometime during his term, Mr. Trump may well react in the time-honored fashion of global populists like President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. To keep his base mobilized and insulate himself from economic troubles, he may take shelter in an intensified form of the identity politics that worked so well for him during the presidential campaign. This would rip American society further apart along racial and ethnic cleavages. The ugliness that characterized politics during the presidential campaign may be nothing compared with what may be yet to come.  By  Teresa Tritch  Financial markets regained their footing on Wednesday, as investors and traders apparently concluded that a Donald Trump presidency might not be so bad after all. Instead of focusing on how unprepared Mr. Trump is to be president, several traders quoted in the media talked about how deregulation from ending Obamacare and the Dodd-Frank financial reforms — two Republican goals — could lift stock prices for health care companies and banks. They took special solace in Mr. Trump’s promise to boost government spending on infrastructure and in the measured tones of his acceptance speech. Unfortunately, there is no escaping the overarching conclusion that Mr. Trump’s campaign promises, if carried out, would harm the economy. His proposed rollback of Dodd-Frank reforms would invite renewed recklessness. His opposition to Obamacare would renew and intensify households’ financial insecurity. His proposed tax cuts for the rich would exacerbate income inequality, while either blowing a hole in the deficit or requiring deep budget cuts. His stance on trade would impair international commerce and cooperation. His proposed deportation of immigrants would unleash a legal and humanitarian crisis. Even his popular call for more infrastructure spending is flawed. In and of itself, Mr. Trump’s pledge to borrow vast sums to spend on infrastructure would be a sensible move at this time of low interest rates. But vastly increased federal indebtedness in addition to his other harmful economic policies would be piling risk on top of risk. Risk-taking that crosses the line into recklessness can be immensely profitable in the short run, which is what many traders care most about. But it is no way to run an economy on which everyone else depends for long-term prosperity.  By  Emily Bazelon  Now it looks like a warning shot. When Justice Antonin Scalia died in February, Donald Trump was among the first to call for stonewalling President Obama’s choice to fill the seat. “It’s called delay, delay, delay,” he said at the opening of the Republican presidential debate on Feb. 13. Senator Harry Reid, the minority leader, countered that it would be “unprecedented in recent history” for the Supreme Court to go a year without a full complement of justices. But other Republicans, chief among them the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, agreed with Mr. Trump and Senator Ted Cruz: Justice Scalia’s seat should remain vacant until after the election. Undeterred (what else was he supposed to be?), President Obama nominated Merrick Garland, a seasoned judge praised in the past by Republicans like Senator Orrin Hatch. A debate ensued over historical facts, which seems quaintly polite in retrospect. Since 1900, had the Senate ever refused to confirm a nominee in a presidential election year as a result of the impending election? The answer was no (even if Mr. Cruz tried to argue, against the facts, that Justice Anthony Kennedy wasn’t confirmed in the election year of 1988.) The Republicans’ refusal to grant Judge Garland a hearing or schedule a vote was in fact unprecedented. It was a new kind of hardball. And it succeeded. For a blip in August, Republicans took a hit in the polls for  obstructing the Garland nomination. But the moment passed, blown away in the chaos and battle of the presidential election. Judge Garland slipped from view. The parties adapted to a new reality in which both expected either his postelection, pre-inauguration confirmation, or a new nominee chosen by the next president. When they assumed Hillary Clinton would win, Republicans including Senators John McCain of Arizona  and Richard Burr of North Carolina talked about blocking Democratic Supreme Court picks indefinitely. Both were re-elected Tuesday and will return to a Senate still controlled by the Republicans. It’s hard to see how any Republican paid a price for radically altering the norms for Supreme Court appointments. Mr. Trump helped point the way, and the voters rewarded him and those who followed. Choosing a justice in Antonin Scalia’s mold, as he has promised, will allow Mr. Trump to prove himself to the social conservatives for whom the court, and Roe v. Wade, are the defining issues. Under the current rules, Democrats could filibuster his choice, but if that happens, how long will those rules last? 
Mr. Trump’s election has already run over far stronger traditions and norms. Next comes the question of how many additional Supreme Court appointments will come his way. Ruth Bader Ginsburg is 83. Anthony Kennedy is 80. Stephen Breyer is 78. In Supreme Court terms, four years is a long time.  By  Peter Wehner  To say that Donald Trump’s victory was a shock may qualify as the understatement of the century. The polls were wrong. The experts were wrong. I was wrong. Almost everyone was wrong — including those in the Trump campaign who expected to lose. His victory wasn’t just a surprise; it was an event of gigantic dimensions, its radiating effects incalculable. Mr. Trump’s win ranks among the most unlikely and stunning elections in American history. Regardless of how the Trump presidency turns out, this race will be studied a century from now. For those of us who have been vehement critics of Mr. Trump, this is a rather challenging moment. Starting on Jan. 20, he will be the only president we have. He now has a democratic legitimacy we may regret but cannot deny, and there is such a thing as democratic grace. To those who are tempted only to rage and attack and lament what has occurred, a word of counsel to them, and to myself: We need to give Mr. Trump the chance to rise to the moment, as unlikely as we think that may be. At the same time, we can’t possibly erase the history of the last 17 months — the words he said, the things he did, the conspiracy theories he wove, the ignorance, volatility and cruelty he showed — and our concerns aren’t going to evaporate now that he’s about to be in charge of the nuclear triad that during the campaign he didn’t even know existed. I believed, and still believe, that he is a man with a disordered personality and authoritarian tendencies. My job is to give him a chance to prove me wrong; his job is to prove me wrong. Among my worries is that Mr. Trump’s victory will validate his style of politics, his serrated rhetoric. The way he mistreats people will be normalized. This election has brought us to dark places. Rather than this approach being repudiated it will, for many, become a model. “All the decent drapery of life is to be rudely torn off,” in the words of Edmund Burke. If the Trump campaign foreshadows his presidency, America under Trump will be fundamentally different than it has been — coarser, less temperate and civilized, more inward and resentful. The Republican Party will fundamentally change, from a conservative party to one that champions European-style ethnic nationalism. (The Democratic Party, whose members were certain Hillary Clinton would win, will be convulsed as it enters a period of intense recrimination.) A few hours after Mr. Trump was declared the winner, I received a note from a friend of mine, the distinguished Christian writer Philip Yancey, who told me, “I’m surprised and befuddled, but not scared, thanks to the checks-and-balances strength of American democracy. I tremble, though, to think what an unpredictable leader offers to a world in growing crisis.” He added, “Some say God moves in mysterious ways.  I say, God grants humans the freedom to move in even more mysterious ways.” What happened on Nov. 8th was a mystery that may lead to calamity. I hope to God it won’t.  By  Anna North  I spent the days leading up to the election in Pennsylvania talking to some young voters , 18, 19, 20 years old. They wore flowered Doc Martens, fake fur coats, earbuds dangling from one ear. Overwhelmingly, they were open and polite. They were smart. They were angry at a political system they felt ignored them, but they hoped for better days ahead. In January, Donald Trump will be their next president. Many of these young people supported Mr. Trump. Many did so reluctantly. One young Trump supporter told me that no one knows exactly what Mr. Trump will do in office. Another described hesitating while filling out his absentee ballot, wondering if he could vote for a man who had made abhorrent comments about women. But some voted for Mr. Trump enthusiastically. Those who supported Hillary Clinton were disgusted by Mr. Trump and what he stands for. Today, they’re dealing with a new reality they didn’t expect. I’m thinking of Bria Blackshear, a 20-year-old Temple University student who had waited more than an hour at her polling place in north Philadelphia. “Donald Trump doesn’t represent the ideals I would want for this country,” she said. I’m thinking of Brooke Renner, 18, also a Temple student, who was waiting in line for a second time. She’d given up earlier, but was back and willing to wait as long as it took to cast her vote for Mrs. Clinton. Otherwise, she said, “I’d feel personally responsible if Donald Trump wins.” I’m thinking of Sierra Taylor, a 19-year-old student at the Community College of Philadelphia, who said, “black people feel like our votes don’t matter.” I’m thinking of her friend Naiya Johnson, 22, who, when asked about her hopes for the next four years, said, “I hope we make it.” I’m also thinking of the young people I saw debating the issues that matter to them. Of the table full of young men at Bucks County Community College arguing about Mr. Trump when one, the quietest, spoke up to say, “Trump has no respect for women.” Of the young man, who, as his friend criticized Mrs. Clinton’s record as secretary of state, interjected that Mr. Trump is racist, sexist and xenophobic. They’d had the argument once before, they said. I hope they keep talking. I think they will. It’s a frightening time to grow up. But these young voters are clear-eyed about the shortcomings of government and optimistic enough to imagine a better world. They can make friends with people of different viewpoints, and, when it matters, they can challenge their friends to think in a new way.  By  Seamus McGraw  BRODHEADSVILLE, Pa. — Thinking back now, I can’t for the life of me figure out how I got it so wrong. He seemed so troubled by what he was about to do, as if he knew it was a mistake, but one he felt compelled to make. The way I read the pained look on his face, I thought he was almost apologizing; maybe seeking a kind of absolution. It was just a few days before the election, and I had been canvassing for the Democrats. I wasn’t out there because I was a particularly ardent Clinton supporter. She had certainly not been my first choice, my second or even my third. I’m one of those middle-aged white men without a college degree who had been holding out for Joe Biden to change his mind. But I felt as if I had an obligation to make certain that, at least in my little corner of Pennsylvania, a man who was, to my mind, so obviously unsuited to the highest office in the world, was not just defeated, but repudiated. I expected that my neighbors and friends and the strangers down the road would do just that. Sure, I could feel and even share their frustration over the fact that the longest postwar economic recovery had left so many of my neighbors behind. I had been left behind, too. And yes, I understood the fear of an uncertain world, and the stress of profound cultural changes that were upending so many things that my neighbors took as bedrock values. But I thought the character traits that had always defined the people I knew in eastern Pennsylvania — true conservatives with a sense of responsibility and decency — would in the end lead them to reject “Trumpism,” whatever that actually is. My job wasn’t to help Clinton win. I thought — or at least the pundits were telling me — that was a done deal. The way I saw it, my only task was to drive up her margins and to do that, I was working off a carefully curated list of likely Clinton voters thoughtfully provided to me by the local campaign office. And so when I knocked on this gentleman’s door on a back road in the rural, conservative West End of Monroe County, and he told me that he was indeed planning on voting for Donald Trump, I was ready to simply turn away. But he wouldn’t let me go. “I just can’t trust her,” he said. He made eye contact and kept it. Relentlessly. He and I were of the same rough demographic. Just like me, he was well into his 50s, with teeth that had seen better days. Just like me, he was lower middle class, judging from his surroundings. And as he rattled off a list of shopworn talking points — Benghazi, emails, pay for play — I felt as if I was hearing a stranger’s confession. I felt as if he wanted me to understand and forgive him for what he was about to do. I remember thinking to myself that when this was over, I was going to have to find a way to build a bridge back to this guy who was, in so many ways, just like me. Such was my arrogance. Late last night, as I watched Pennsylvania turn red for the first time in a generation, I kept thinking back to that man, and how I so misread his expression and his words. It wasn’t sorrow etched in his face. It was pity. For me. Because he knew, long before I did, how wrong I was.  —  Seamus McGraw is the author of “Betting the Farm on a Drought.”   By  Beverly Gage  In his victory speech last night, Donald J. Trump paid homage to “the forgotten men and women of our country,” vowing that they “will be forgotten no longer.” This essential political idea — that a vast segment of the nation’s white citizens have been overlooked, or looked down upon — has driven every major realignment in American politics since the New Deal. In 1932, at the darkest moment of the Great Depression, Franklin Roosevelt evoked the “forgotten man” as a reason to rebuild the economy from the “bottom up.” More than three decades later, after Richard Nixon’s 1968 victory, the journalist Peter Schrag identified the “Forgotten American” — the white “lower middle class” voter — as the key to the nation’s apparent rejection of the Great Society and the New Deal order. “In the guise of the working class — or the American yeoman or John Smith — he was once the hero of the civic books, the man that Andrew Jackson called ‘the bone and sinew of the country,’ ” Mr. Schrag wrote. “Now he is ‘the forgotten man,’ perhaps the most alienated person in America.” That this “forgotten” American could be used both to uphold and to dismantle liberalism suggests that this American political identity has never been especially fixed: Democrat or Republican, liberal or conservative, but populist above all. Since the 1960s, the phrase has also implied that the country was paying too much attention to the wrong sorts of people — most notably, to African-Americans — at the expense of the white working class.
It is no coincidence that the “forgotten men and women of our country” began their migration into the Republican Party at the very moment that African-Americans were asserting their right to vote, and voting Democratic, in large numbers for the first time. Mr. Trump’s victory will go down as one of the great upsets in United States history, but it is also the product of a long and bitter struggle over race and class in this country. The Yale sociologist William Graham Sumner is often credited with coining the term “forgotten man.” Writing near the dawn of the Progressive Era, he lamented the lost autonomy of hard-working citizens suddenly forced to pay for high-flown programs of social reform. Sumner’s most famous political essay, “What the Social Classes Owe to Each Other,” rejected the very idea that government might mitigate class antagonisms by sharing the social wealth. What did social classes owe to each other? Not much, in Sumner’s view. And his “forgotten man” owed the least of all. In his 1932 campaign for the presidency, Roosevelt sought to claim the term for a different and more expansive purpose. “These unhappy times call for the building of plans that rest upon the forgotten,” he said in a radio address from Albany in April 1932, for plans “that build from the bottom up and not from the top down, that put their faith once more in the forgotten man at the bottom of the economic pyramid.” To Roosevelt, the “forgotten man” encompassed the industrial worker and struggling farmer and Keynesian consumer — ordinary citizens without whom a modern economy would falter. He built the New Deal around this image, establishing the minimum wage, Social Security and the federal right to organize unions. Those reforms cemented the loyalty of the white working class to the Democratic Party for a generation. But the New Deal also “forgot” — or excluded — many people, including African-Americans. When the Great Society came along, Lyndon Johnson tried to make up for that by expanding federal programs serving the poor and by championing the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts. As the country started to “remember” its long-delayed promises of equality, however, the “forgotten American” began to emerge as term of exclusion and resistance to change. “There is hardly a language to describe him, or even a set of social statistics,” Mr. Schrag wrote in his August 1969 essay, “ The Forgotten American .” “Just names: racist-bigot-redneck-ethnic-Irish-Italian-Pole-Hunkie-Yahoo. The lower middle class. A blank.” As Mr. Schrag noted, all of that name-calling was part of the problem, a refusal on the part of liberal elites to recognize the real grievances and desires of what had once been a bedrock Democratic constituency. In the 1968 campaign, Nixon capitalized on this resentment with calls for “law and order,” a phrase that evoked not only fears of crime, but also anger at protesters and rioters and the college-campus liberals who tolerated them. Mr. Trump put that phrase back into political circulation in 2016, a gesture of solidarity with the old ways of thinking about the “silent majority” — and the “forgotten American.” And though he included “men and women” in his victory speech, Mr. Trump’s campaign mobilized around the same image that once animated the Roosevelt coalition: the “forgotten” white working-class man. Race, too, remains an indelible part of today’s conversation about who has been “forgotten” and who deserves to be seen. To dismiss this language as simple racism, however, is to miss at least some of its political significance. What happened in the late 1960s and 1970s was not only that the Republican Party reclaimed and redefined Roosevelt’s “forgotten man” for a more conservative age. During those years, the Democratic Party itself began to turn away from the New Deal and its working-class politics, especially from its commitment to organized labor. With Mr. Trump’s election, we may be witnessing the rise of a new party system, with the Democrats now the standard-bearers of racial tolerance and free-market globalization, and the Republicans the party of nationalist populist revolt. But as Roosevelt showed, this need not be a fixed political equation. If the 2016 election marks the final, gasping end of the New Deal coalition, it should also mark the start of a new reckoning within the Democratic Party.  By  Helen Lewis  LONDON — You can’t throw a peanut in a Westminster pub without hitting an obsessive follower of American politics. Start a conversation about “The West Wing” with any member of Parliament and expect to get a long disquisition on that American political drama’s best episodes. During Britain’s last general election, in 2015, both main political parties here proudly boasted about being advised by veterans of Barack Obama’s campaign. Until now, our Americophilia has been unrequited. Then in August, Donald J. Trump declared himself “Mr. Brexit.” For Mr. Trump and his supporters, Britain’s vote in June to leave the European Union was evidence of a growing popular revolt against multiculturalism, porous borders and political elites. If the British electorate could deliver a result that baffled its financial sector, its scientists and metropolitan liberals – and was not widely predicted by pollsters – couldn’t the same sort of upset happen in America? It just did. Mr. Trump’s victory feels like a flashback to June, although where Brexit divided members of Britain’s political class, the American election results have united them. Politicians of the mainstream right and left alike are dumbfounded that the United States  would elect someone who uses the extreme language Mr. Trump does and who seems to have little love for institutions like NATO. Last December, Britain’s former Conservative prime minister, David Cameron, described Mr. Trump’s proposed ban on Muslims entering America as “divisive, stupid and wrong.” The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan of the Labour Party, has called the president-elect’s views on Islam “ignorant.” Apart from Nigel Farage, the face of the far-right U.K. Independence Party, it is difficult to find a British politician with a good word to say about Mr. Trump. Nationalism, white anger and protectionism are now driving politics in Britain and across Europe. The sound is of doors slamming. Brexit felt like a referendum on border control, and on rapid demographic change among white communities that felt themselves deprived of attention and resources. It is tempting to draw comparisons with the United States: The big cities in both Britain and the United States, which are most diverse, are also most relaxed about that diversity. In smaller communities, immigration feels more disruptive. There are other parallels. Mr. Trump’s victory was driven by older, white voters, who were struggling but not destitute. He won white men without college degrees by a landslide. A typical Leave supporter has a similar demographic profile. Such voters are on the decline, as both Britain and the United States become more diverse and younger generations are better-educated, and more open to immigration and change. But as both the Brexit vote and Mr. Trump’s victory showed, they are far from a spent force.  By  Susan Chira  Women, as Hillary Clinton showed this morning , know how to absorb pain. And Mrs. Clinton has had plenty of practice about how to stand before the cameras after public humiliation. Clearly, she needed time to compose herself. She made no appearances overnight, instead calling Donald J. Trump to concede. But when she strode onstage in purple and gray, Bill Clinton behind her in a purple tie, her voice did not waver. Women seldom have the luxury of giving in to pain. Many have children or grandchildren or aging parents to tend, whether they themselves are sick or in emotional turmoil. So Mrs. Clinton faced her despondent campaign staff and her despondent half of the country and tried to rally them. She spoke most directly to young people, and to women and girls. She had hoped to stand before them as a symbol of all that women could achieve. Now she had to demonstrate once again what women can endure. “I’ve had successes and setbacks, sometimes really painful ones,” she told them. It was hard not to recall her standing beside Bill Clinton after the whole world knew graphic and humiliating details about the affairs he had denied having. “To all the women and especially the young women who put their faith in me I want you to know that nothing has made me prouder than to be your champion,” she said, and here she had to clear her throat. “I know we still have not shattered that highest and hardest glass ceiling but some day somebody will, and hopefully sooner than we might think right now.” It’s difficult to know right now all that stood in the way of shattering that ceiling. Was it a woman, or this woman? Was it Mrs. Clinton as symbol of the Washington establishment, as a consummate insider in a time of profound distrust of the elite? We do know that voters disproportionately punish women who are seen as dishonest. We do know that it’s hard for strong, assertive and ambitious women to be seen as likable and competent at the same time. Political scientists and cultural commentators will long debate what happened in this election, to this woman and to many women.  The question is whether the image of Mrs. Clinton, composed and gracious in defeat, persevering through pain, will inspire women to try again?  By  Felix Salmon  Markets always move after seismic events, like the unexpected election of Donald J. Trump. Still, market moves need to be interpreted. Even if you believe that markets are right, it’s not always obvious what they’re saying. One way to think about the market’s gyrations is the idea of mean and variation. When Barack Obama (a.k.a. No Drama Obama) was elected president, it was possible to anticipate — correctly, it turned out — that he would help steer America back onto a course of steady growth, low inflation and falling unemployment. Think of that as the Obama mean: the baseline expectation. When the stock market expects good things like that, it tends to rise, just as it has during the Obama presidency. But the variation is just as important as the mean. Mr. Obama didn’t always give the markets what they wanted, but by the same token he was always clear about what he was going to do. He promised them something much more valuable: a low-risk upward economic trajectory. Mr. Trump is the exact opposite of Mr. Obama. His baseline is worse, for starters: to establish expectations for his presidency, you have to factor in his hugely irresponsible fiscal policy, potential trade wars and maybe even reckless brinkmanship over repaying the national debt. Put those things together, and a severe recession becomes possible. But it gets even worse because Mr. Trump is by his nature highly unpredictable. However bad you think he’s going to be, it’s entirely possible that your prediction will turn out to be ridiculously optimistic. Mr. Trump has vastly more downside risk than Mr. Obama ever had, and so markets are going to trade at a discount to his already-discounted baseline. If you transition, then, from low-risk positive expectations to high-risk negative expectations, you have to expect the markets to take some precipitous plunges along the way. Much of that will be noise. The markets always fluctuate randomly in the short term, and there’s no point in trying to read anything meaningful into those moves. That’s why it’s dangerous to read too much into midnight stock-market futures trading, or a sudden plunge in the value of the Mexican peso once it becomes obvious that Mr. Trump will become president. Those moves might be a rational response to the lower expected value of the assets in question. On the other hand, they might just be the result of panicky hedging — or indeed they could simply represent dealers second-guessing and trying to outmaneuver one another. Once the market has been trading steadily for a few months, its general direction under the auspices of the new government is going to be pretty clear. Fluctuations over just a few hours, by contrast, are much harder to read. They might look like signals — but all too often they turn out to be nothing but noise. And as we’ve learned during this long, brutal election, separating noise from signals can be a very tricky business.  By  Michael Lerner  It turns out that shaming the supporters of Donald J. Trump is not a good political strategy. Though job loss and economic stagnation played a role in his victory, so did shame. As the principal investigator on a study of the middle class for the National Institute of Mental Health, I found that working people’s stress is often intensified by shame at their failure to “make it” in what they are taught is a meritocratic American economy. The right has been very successful at persuading working people that they are vulnerable not because they themselves have failed, but because of the selfishness of some other villain (African-Americans, feminists, immigrants, Muslims, Jews, liberals, progressives; the list keeps growing). Instead of challenging this ideology of shame, the left has buttressed it by blaming white people as a whole for slavery, genocide of the Native Americans and a host of other sins, as though whiteness itself was something about which people ought to be ashamed. The rage many white working-class people feel in response is rooted in the sense that once again, as has happened to them throughout their lives, they are being misunderstood. So please understand what is happening here. Many Trump supporters very legitimately feel that it is they who have been facing an unfair reality. The upper 20 percent of income earners, many of them quite liberal and rightly committed to the defense of minorities and immigrants, also believe in the economic meritocracy and their own right to have so much more than those who are less fortunate. So while they may be progressive on issues of discrimination against the obvious victims of racism and sexism, they are blind to their own class privilege and to the hidden injuries of class that are internalized by much of the country as self-blame. The right’s ability to portray liberals as elitists is further strengthened by the phobia toward religion that prevails in the left. Many religious people are drawn by the teachings of their tradition to humane values and caring about the oppressed. Yet they often find that liberal culture is hostile to religion of any sort, believing it is irrational and filled with hate. People on the left rarely open themselves to the possibility that there could be a spiritual crisis in society that plays a role in the lives of many who feel misunderstood and denigrated by the fancy intellectuals and radical activists. The left needs to stop ignoring people’s inner pain and fear. The racism, sexism and xenophobia used by Mr. Trump to advance his candidacy does not reveal an inherent malice in the majority of Americans. If the left could abandon all this shaming, it could rebuild its political base by helping Americans see that much of people’s suffering is rooted in the hidden injuries of class and in the spiritual crisis that the global competitive marketplace generates. Democrats need to become as conscious and articulate about the suffering caused by classism as we are about other forms of suffering. We need to reach out to Trump voters in a spirit of empathy and contrition. Only then can we help working people understand that they do not live in a meritocracy, that their intuition that the system is rigged is correct (but it is not by those whom they had been taught to blame) and that their pain and rage is legitimate."
"","Advertisement  By  The New York Times  How the election and Donald Trump’s victory looks to Opinion writers.  By  Lindy West  I got up on Election Day and burst into tears — not a genteel twin trickle but a great heaving burst, zero to firehose. Tears spattered the inside of my glasses, dripped from my lips, and left mascara-tinged rosettes blooming black in my cereal milk. “Honey,” my husband crooned to me. “Honey, it’s going to be O.K. The numbers are still good. It’s O.K.” But it wasn’t the numbers. I wasn’t sobbing because I was afraid Hillary Clinton was going to lose. That would come later. I was sobbing Tuesday morning because, as I poured my coffee, I’d caught a glimpse of a cable news interview with Mrs. Clinton just after she voted for herself in Chappaqua, N.Y. She seemed breathless, exhilarated, a little overwhelmed. Over her shoulder, Bill Clinton stared at his wife and beamed. My husband stares at me like that sometimes. It’s not just love — we expect husbands to love their wives — but something less traditional, more conditional and gendered. It’s professional respect. It’s pride. We’re accustomed to that pride flowing the other direction, from wife to husband, because men in our culture get to be more than just bodies, do more than just nurture. Men get to act and excel and climb and aspire and thrive and win and rule and be the audacious, hungry fulcrum of public life. It is normal for men to have ambition. It is normal for women to stand aside. I thought about Bill Clinton meeting Hillary Rodham at Yale in 1971, and how tenacious and intense she must have been even back then, how undeniable and potent. Mr. Clinton describes the moment in his memoir . “She conveyed a sense of strength and self-possession I had rarely seen in anyone, man or woman,“ he wrote. "She was in my face from the start.” He says he once told her , during those years, “I have met all the most gifted people in our generation and you’re the best.” And then I thought about Mr. Clinton rising steadily through his political career, on the track we have built for charismatic, competent white men. He must have known, every second, how good his wife was. Not just good, but “the best.” Better than everyone he’d ever met; better than him, even. And he watched her stand next to him and wait, and wait, and wait, underestimated and degraded and excoriated for wanting more out of life than cookies. And she didn’t quit! She swallowed slander and humiliation and irrational hatred for three decades and she didn’t quit, and here she was, just a hair’s breadth from the presidency of the United States — the first woman ever to be trusted with the rudder of the world. He must be so proud of her, I thought. It made me cry. I cried because I want my daughters to feel that blazing pride, that affirmation of their boundless capacity — not from their husbands, but from their world, from the atmosphere, from inviolable wells of certainty inside themselves. I cried because it’s not fair, and I’m so tired, and every woman I know is so tired. I cried because I don’t even know what it feels like to be taken seriously — not fully, not in that whole, unequivocal, confident way that’s native to handshakes between men. I cried because it does things to you to always come second. Whatever your personal opinion of the Clintons, as politicians or as human beings, that dynamic is real. We, as a culture, do not take women seriously on a profound level. We do not believe women. We do not trust women. We do not like women. I understand that many men cannot see it, and plenty more do not care. I know that many men will read this and laugh, or become defensive, or call me hysterical, or worse, and that’s fine. I am used to it. It doesn’t make me wrong. But maybe this election was the beginning of something new, I thought. Not the death of sexism, but the birth of a world in which women’s inferiority isn’t a given. That grain of hope glowed inside me until around dinner time on Tuesday, the final day of an election so openly misogynist that the question “Sexual assault: good or bad?” was credulously presented for debate. Today doesn’t feel real. It is indistinguishable from fresh, close grief. But if there’s one lesson we can take from Mrs. Clinton, politics aside — and even Donald Trump acknowledged it in the second debate — it’s the limitlessness of human endurance. Those of us who have been left in the cold by this apparent affirmation of a white supremacist patriarchy (and sorry, white women who voted for Mr. Trump, but your shelter is illusory) are tough. We have been weathering this hurricane wall of doubt and violence for so long, and now, more crystalline than ever, we have an enemy and a mandate. We have the smirking apotheosis of our oppression sliming, paw-first, toward our genitals. We have the popular vote. We have proof, in exit polls, that white women will pawn their humanity for the safety of white supremacy. We have abortion pills to stockpile and neighbors to protect and children to teach. We have the right woman to find. We have local elections in a year. The fact that we lost doesn’t make us wrong; the fact that they don’t believe in us doesn’t make us disappear.  By  Daniel K. Williams  Donald J. Trump was elected with a higher percentage of the white evangelical vote than any other Republican presidential candidate has ever received, and he has received strong support from prominent Christian Right leaders. Yet if Mr. Trump delivers on his promises, he will not give the religious right what its leaders have traditionally demanded or what the Republican Party platform calls for. Indeed, he will give them very little national legislation at all, but will instead offer them maximum latitude to pursue their agenda at the state level — a shift that may portend a potential breakthrough in the nation’s polarizing culture wars. National legislation has long been the goal of the religious right. When the movement emerged in the late 1970s, evangelical leaders such as Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson sought federal constitutional amendments to ban abortion and restore school prayer, because they wanted to reverse what liberal rights activists had done at the national level through the Supreme Court. In the early 21st century, leaders such as James Dobson continued this trend by persuading   President George W. Bush to endorse a constitutional amendment proposal to define marriage as exclusively heterosexual. In recent years, evangelicals have become so concerned about protecting their own religious liberty against federal mandates or court decisions that they have given less attention to imposing a moral agenda on the rest of the nation. Although the Republican Party platform continues to promise a constitutional amendment protecting human life from the moment of conception, the pro-life movement has not made any serious attempts to pass that amendment since the 1980s. Nor has there been much talk in the last decade of a national ban on same-sex marriage. Mr. Trump is well positioned to promote a further shift away from national moral regulation. For much of his adult life, he held culturally libertarian views on abortion and gay rights, and he evinced little interest in the religious right’s agenda. Early in his campaign, he expressed discomfort with conservative evangelicals’ opposition to the rights of transgender people to use the public restroom of their choice. But he quickly came to embrace a “states’ rights” position on same-sex marriage and transgender rights, a position that would allow culturally liberal New Yorkers the right to pursue different policies than cultural conservatives in Mississippi or North Dakota. And while Mr. Trump stumbled over abortion during his campaign, the policy that he ultimately reverted to was to leave abortion legalization up to the states — an outcome that he would try to ensure by nominating conservative Supreme Court justices who might overturn Roe v. Wade. Mr. Trump has gone further than any previous Republican presidential nominee in a generation in insisting that the religious right should enact its agenda at the state, rather than federal, level.  Although this was the policy position of many Republicans during the 1970s (including President Gerald Ford), religious right activists persuaded the G.O.P. in the early 1980s to abandon its states-rights approach to abortion and other social issues, and promise national legislation to implement the religious right’s agenda. Mr. Trump is leading the party back to its more traditional stance. While many liberals will find this outcome unsatisfactory — since it offers them no opportunity to secure national protection for individual rights that they consider inalienable — it may be the only compromise solution that can give both conservatives and liberals the freedom to pursue their own agenda at the local level without fear of a national backlash. If a socially libertarian New Yorker can deliver this compromise to the conservative white rural evangelical voters who put him in office, both conservatives and liberals should see that for what it is: a landmark opportunity to move beyond the culture wars.  By  Marwan Bishara  Just when the people of the Middle East thought things couldn’t get any worse, Donald J. Trump is elected president of the United States. Now, their apprehension about the president-elect dwarfs their disappointment with President Obama. It could be a blessing in disguise. America, in one magic moment, you’ve revealed how you’ve changed. For the worse. Poor you, you feel so insecure, vulnerable and fragile. Like the rest of us. So, instead of reaching for your famed “can-do” spirit, lifting yourselves up by the bootstraps, you turned to a strident, bellicose type of nationalism. The kind usually associated with strutting generalissimos of Third World nations with their chests covered with made-up, self-awarded medals. Maybe the people of the Middle East will look and realize that you are no longer the Great Democracy to emulate. That your modern style of empire and your role as keeper of the world order for the world’s own good are stumbling and failing, even in your own eyes; and that we in the Middle East should not be turning to you for rescue. For as long as I can remember, you’ve been on a self-assigned mission to change the Middle East. Indeed, the world. Now, it seems as if the change has flowed the other way. You’ve voted to reduce your liberties. To narrow the range of people entitled to justice and equality before the law. To live in a place where the police should not be criticized; where fighting political correctness is more important than fighting racism; where Muslims are suspected and people who appear Hispanic can be rounded up if they’re not carrying their papers. In this election you’ve revealed that your people — like Russians, Hungarians, Iraqis, Iranians and others whose politics you normally look down on — will choose a narrow, nonsensical nationalist ethos when they feel threatened by uncertainty. Your imperial outreach allowed you to experience other cultures, but now you’ve chosen to shrink your outlook, with the expectation that the world will continue to revolve around you. It won’t. Like the rest of us, you’re now divided between those who want to make their nation great again alone and those who want to make it great together. O.K., enough about you; let’s talk about us. We in the Middle East can’t decipher what exactly your incoming president wants from us. I don’t think he knows, either. Mr. Trump said he would bring back torture and ban Muslims from entering America, and he compared the threat of “radical Islam” to Soviet Communism. He wants less engagement in the region, and fewer “free riders” like the Saudis who don’t pay enough for American protection. And he wants the United States to abandon the costly nation-building in the Middle East. What nation-building? In Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Yemen, Libya and Somalia, civil wars continue unabated. The Arab and Muslim worlds only hope the United States stops contributing to the destruction.
Mr. Trump does not exactly seem concerned for the wishes of Middle Easterners and their right to live in peace. It sounds more like what he really wants to do is pal around with other strutting, authoritarian types. Expect him to cozy up to Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, and join him in supporting Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad. Expect America’s new president to work closely with Egypt’s president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, and Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. Mr. Trump has embraced Mr. Netanyahu’s positions on Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and on abandoning the two-state solution. Instead of Americanizing the Middle East, Mr. Trump seems set on “Israelizing” America, stirring fear of Muslims and trying to wall out “the other.” Arabs, and Middle Easterners in general, should take one quick look and figure out how to be less dependent on the United States, and how to resolve their conflicts within their own, regional frameworks.
Finally, some good news. President Obama has assured us that the sun will rise tomorrow, regardless. And if the Trump presidency is as bad as I expect it to be — though not so bad that it demolishes democracy entirely — he can be voted out in four years. Meanwhile, fasten your seatbelts. It’s going to be a hell of a ride.  By  Carol Giacomo  A commitment to human rights has been a fundamental precept of NATO since the alliance was created a half century ago. You would not expect that a founding member would have to be reminded of that fact. Certainly not the United States, for all those years the leader of NATO and an inspirational embodiment of its core values. Yet this is where we find ourselves now, the day after Donald Trump won the presidency: In congratulating him on his victory, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany felt compelled to set conditions for cooperation. “Germany and America are connected by values of democracy, freedom and respect for the law and the dignity of man, independent of origin, skin color, religion, gender, sexual orientation or political views,” she said in a statement, adding: “I offer the next President of the United States close cooperation on the basis of these values.” Mr. Trump’s behavior during his campaign was antithetical to those values. He has threatened to ban Muslims from the United States, refuse refugees, deport 11 million undocumented workers and build a wall on the border with Mexico. He has disparaged African Americans, Mexican Americans, women and people with disabilities. Moreover, Mr. Trump has called into question America’s commitment to NATO and displayed a befuddling penchant for defending Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, who is waging war in eastern Ukraine and destabilizing other parts of Europe by supporting far-right groups. He received no pushback on Wednesday from Theresa May, the British prime minister, who simply congratulated Mr. Trump on his win. The two leaders’ reactions were further proof that, after Britain’s decision to leave the European Union, we will have to look to Mrs. Merkel not just to lead Europe but to replace America in leading NATO as well.  By  Gil Troy  “I am scared that if Ronald Reagan gets into office, we are going to see more of the Ku Klux Klan and a resurgence of the Nazi Party,” Coretta Scott King said in November, 1980. “I’m afraid things are going to blow sky high during this next term,” a nursing student said. He’s a “nitwit,” added a Democrat. “He’s shallow, superficial and frightening,” one of that year’s historic numbers of “undecideds” insisted. Ronald Reagan “seems not to relish complexity and subtlety,” the New York Times editorial endorsing President Jimmy Carter’s re-election proclaimed. “The problem is not a loose lip but the simple answer.”  While fearing what Reagan’s own running mate, George H.W. Bush, had dismissed as Reagan’s “voodoo economics” during their primary fight, the editorial board feared “voodoo diplomacy,” too. From coast to coast, half of a divided nation abhorred —  and underestimated — the president-elect. “The American people,“ Hamilton Jordan, a key Carter aide, said, "are not going to elect a 70-year-old, right-wing, ex-movie actor to be president.” Pollsters reported in 1980 that “More voters held negative attitudes toward each presidential candidate than in any campaign since polling began” — a record we just broke in 2016. The economic dislocation of galloping inflation and the energy crisis produced a nasty campaign. Feeling neglected by Washington, millions embraced Ronald Reagan’s populism. Despite the Democratic panic, Ronald Reagan left America richer and safer after two terms as president. Reagan defied expectations by turning toward the center. He acted as president of the United States, not president of the Republican Party. Reagan used the transition period to heal wounds while claiming a broad policy mandate, despite winning only 50.7 percent of the popular vote. He vowed to “rebuild a bipartisan base for American foreign policy.” His cabinet choices were so moderate that Pat Buchanan, the conservative flamethrower whose rhetorical bluster anticipated the advent of Donald Trump, lamented: “Where is the dash, color, and controversy — the customary concomitants of a Reagan campaign?” Just weeks into Reagan’s first term, conservatives were demanding that his aides had to “Let Reagan be Reagan,” meaning: stop being so reasonable. But in adjusting, in tempering, Reagan was being Reagan. He knew the Constitution limited presidential powers — and he faced a Democratic Congress led by the formidable speaker of the House Tip O’Neill to remind him further. Illustrating Richard Neustadt’s lesson that the power of the president is mostly “the power to persuade,” many of Reagan’s achievements were symbolic. Rather than shrinking government as he promised, for example, he only lowered the federal government’s growth rate. History is not destiny. And Reagan had both a lighter touch than Mr. Trump, and eight years’ experience as  governor of California. Still, history is full of shifts and surprises. Mr. Trump must be a healer and unite America, as he tried doing in his victory speech. If he fails, the checks and balances that sometimes help crusading ideologues become effective leaders can ultimately impose a necessary gridlock. When asked about conservatives’ frustration with him, Reagan kindly insisted it was only a “very few” critics. He said: “There are some people who think that you should, on principle, jump off the cliff with the flag flying if you can’t get everything you want.” Reagan recalled that “If I found when I was governor that I could not get 100 percent of what I asked for, I took 80 percent.” So far, Mr. Trump, the political amateur and sputtering demagogue, has lacked Reagan’s magnanimity or his flexibility. Can the reality-show star turned president-elect mimic the actor turned president?  By  James R. Jones  In 1968, there was a demand among voters for change, especially regarding Vietnam and foreign policy, and there was a backlash against some of the Great Society programs. Then, as now, the Democratic candidate was tied to the departing administration and hamstrung to differentiate a new set of policies. As a result, the Democratic presidential nominee, Hubert H. Humphrey, narrowly lost to the Republican, Richard M. Nixon, a candidate who was despised by a large percentage of the electorate. One positive outcome of that election was the first organized transition from the departing to incoming governments. President Lyndon B. Johnson always believed that, after an election, Democrats and Republicans should come together to do what’s right for the country. At the time, I was President Johnson’s appointments secretary, the position that has since evolved into the White House chief of staff. Right after the 1968 results came in, the president put me in charge of organizing a transition process, something that had never been done. “Nixon is an S.O.B., but he’s the only president we’ll have,” Johnson told me. “I want him and all of his team to be fully prepared to govern after the Inauguration at 12 noon on January 20.” A few days later, Johnson and Nixon met at the White House along with Nixon’s top advisers, including H. R. Haldeman and John Mitchell. There we mapped out a program in which all of the Johnson cabinet and major White House staff members would brief their incoming counterparts as often as was desired by the new administration. My charge was to work with Haldeman, who became my successor at the White House, to make sure these briefings occurred across the new administration and in a timely fashion. One surprise was that Nixon told me that Mitchell could speak for him in all matters if he was not available. Johnson would have never delegated such authority, but that was the difference in the management style of the two men. While a smooth transition was important to Johnson, he didn’t stop being president. He was issuing orders and making appointments right up to the morning of the Inauguration. In fact, the day before the Inauguration the president told me to find out how many vacancies existed on commissions and boards and find good people that he could nominate. He kept Nixon waiting in the Blue Room on Inauguration morning while he signed those nominations (which required Senate confirmation) and had them delivered to the Congress before noon. It is a positive sign that President Obama invited Donald J. Trump to meet at the White House two days after this most contentious election. Today transitions are much more institutional now than our first one in 1968. But this process can heal many wounds and start bringing our country closer together. That’s imperative if we want to make our government work for the people again. Back in 1968, Johnson and Nixon left the White House together, along with Senator Everett Dirksen and me. We jumped into the car and headed to the Capitol. Surprisingly, Nixon wanted only to discuss how disappointed he was to have lost Texas (Johnson’s home state) and how determined he was to win it in1972. I hope the ride to the Capitol next January will be more substantive on policy.  By  Sarah Jaffe  If anything has been made clear by the results of this election, it is that the political and pundit class have underestimated the degree of anger and pain in the United States, the degree to which “recovery” has been recovery for a few and stagnation and decline for many more. One exit poll has been haunting me since I saw it: The Reuters/Ipsos early exit poll found that 75 percent of respondents agreed “America needs a strong leader to take the country back from the rich and powerful.” Only slightly fewer agreed that “the American economy is rigged to advantage the rich and powerful,” and — perhaps the kicker — 68 percent believed that “traditional parties and politicians don’t care about people like me.” There’s a lot to unpack in those statements. They may conceal white resentment of the perceived advancement past them of black and Latino people. But they also reveal the sentiment that has been there since the 2008 financial crisis laid bare the lines of power in the country and the world — when, as the protest chant went, “Banks got bailed out, we got sold out.” The downward trends have been with us for decades: the divergence of productivity gains from workers’ incomes, the substitution of credit card debt for raises, the shift of good union jobs and family wages and pensions into low-wage service jobs, and the attendant slashing of the social safety net. But the past eight years sped all that up and made it impossible to ignore. If Donald J. Trump stood out to voters from the rest of the Republican Party, aside from a willingness to say directly the kinds of things usually carefully dogwhistled, it was in his rants about trade and his lack of interest in dismantling the remnants of the welfare state. For white Americans anxiously looking at their disappearing stability, Mr. Trump was a bomb they were willing to throw at a system they felt was failing them. He emotionally echoed their outrage and gave them a place to direct their anger, the age-old right-wing populist trick of refracting it both upward at elites and downward at minorities. Hillary Clinton’s campaign and the mainstream Democratic Party were woefully unprepared to greet this wave. When your response to a cry of “Make America Great Again!” is “America Is Already Great!” you’d better be sure that it feels true to a majority of voters. The results show that it did not. To be sure, Democrats had an uneasy line to walk, between maintaining continuity with a still-popular, twice-elected Barack Obama — a continuity that won Mrs. Clinton the Democratic primary — and reaching the people who wanted and needed change. But the party’s wholehearted backing of Mrs. Clinton was a colossal misreading of a moment when rage at the establishment (of both parties) was simmering everywhere. That rage should have been visible as Mr. Trump ran away with the Republican nomination process despite the opposition of that party’s grandees, and as Bernie Sanders pushed Mrs. Clinton much harder than anyone had expected a gray-haired socialist from Vermont to do. But Mrs. Clinton opened her arms to disaffected Republicans rather than wooing the disaffected within and around her own party. Most of the television ads she ran were more about painting Trump as a dangerous aberration, an outsider unfit for office, than pitching any plan of her own for change. Democrats failed to realize that for many Trump voters, that was exactly what they liked about him.  By  Will Wilkinson  It may not be an exaggeration to say that Donald Trump both knows and cares less about the details of public policy than anyone ever elected president of the United States. This just goes to show that “politics is not about policy,” as Robin Hanson, the futurist and social theorist, likes to say. Mr. Trump’s playbook against Hillary Clinton broke with the hard-won norms of liberal democracy, went back to demagogic, authoritarian political basics, and updated them for  the reality television, social media age. Politics is, at bottom, about factions vying and coordinating to choose leaders in whom to invest authority. Throughout the campaign, Mr. Trump displayed an uncanny and unnerving mastery of the primal politics of authority, and the game of legitimizing his own and delegitimizing his rivals’ claims to authority. In Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump drew a general election opponent pre-weakened by a decades-long Republican campaign of delegitimization. He took advantage of it with shameless audacity, making the most of our culture’s lingering sexism and the popular perception of Mrs. Clinton as a member of an arrogant and corrupt elite that believes it is above the law. But tearing down his opponents was only half of Trump’s equation. The pundits and pollsters so badly botched their predictions in no small part because they failed to grasp the intense, reality-distorting power of Donald Trump’s fame. But Mr. Trump seems to have an intuitive understanding that glamour, celebrity and gaudy wealth are key ingredients in majesty — which is inherently authoritative and underwrites its own claim to legitimacy. Trump’s self-branded personal jet was more than a convenient means of transportation for a very rich man. It was a purple silk, ermine-fringed cape, Air Force One in waiting, and he knew how to use it. The United States, the world’s first nation founded on principled opposition to the pre-Enlightenment politics of majesty and unified authority, has deep-seated norms of republican modesty and propriety. Casting those norms aside and banking heavily on the atavistic political appeal of majestic celebrity gave Mr. Trump an advantage few us were prepared to acknowledge, allowing him to attract the support of an unforeseen numbers of black, Hispanic and female voters, despite his campaign’s naked racism and his scandalously misogynistic and abusive personal history. Because Mr. Trump’s strategy was so indifferent to matters of policy substance, it is incredibly difficult to say what policies Mr. Trump will actually support in office. I don’t think we’ve ever known less about what an incoming president really wants to do with his power. But we do have a clear indication of how he’s likely to wield it. He will cleverly burnish his claim to authority and relentlessly and effectively discredit his opponents, inside and outside the Republican Party, with all the tools of an executive branch that has never been more powerful and less constrained by the constitutional system America’s founders designed specifically as an alternative to and a bulwark against unitary authority.  By  Lindy West  I got up on Election Day and burst into tears — not a genteel twin trickle but a great heaving burst, zero to firehose. Tears spattered the inside of my glasses, dripped from my lips, and left mascara-tinged rosettes blooming black in my cereal milk. “Honey,” my husband crooned to me. “Honey, it’s going to be O.K. The numbers are still good. It’s O.K.” But it wasn’t the numbers. I wasn’t sobbing because I was afraid Hillary Clinton was going to lose. That would come later. I was sobbing Tuesday morning because, as I poured my coffee, I’d caught a glimpse of a cable news interview with Mrs. Clinton just after she voted for herself in Chappaqua, N.Y. She seemed breathless, exhilarated, a little overwhelmed. Over her shoulder, Bill Clinton stared at his wife and beamed. My husband stares at me like that sometimes. It’s not just love — we expect husbands to love their wives — but something less traditional, more conditional and gendered. It’s professional respect. It’s pride. We’re accustomed to that pride flowing the other direction, from wife to husband, because men in our culture get to be more than just bodies, do more than just nurture. Men get to act and excel and climb and aspire and thrive and win and rule and be the audacious, hungry fulcrum of public life. It is normal for men to have ambition. It is normal for women to stand aside. I thought about Bill Clinton meeting Hillary Rodham at Yale in 1971, and how tenacious and intense she must have been even back then, how undeniable and potent. Mr. Clinton describes the moment in his memoir . “She conveyed a sense of strength and self-possession I had rarely seen in anyone, man or woman,“ he wrote. "She was in my face from the start.” He says he once told her , during those years, “I have met all the most gifted people in our generation and you’re the best.” And then I thought about Mr. Clinton rising steadily through his political career, on the track we have built for charismatic, competent white men. He must have known, every second, how good his wife was. Not just good, but “the best.” Better than everyone he’d ever met; better than him, even. And he watched her stand next to him and wait, and wait, and wait, underestimated and degraded and excoriated for wanting more out of life than cookies. And she didn’t quit! She swallowed slander and humiliation and irrational hatred for three decades and she didn’t quit, and here she was, just a hair’s breadth from the presidency of the United States — the first woman ever to be trusted with the rudder of the world. He must be so proud of her, I thought. It made me cry. I cried because I want my daughters to feel that blazing pride, that affirmation of their boundless capacity — not from their husbands, but from their world, from the atmosphere, from inviolable wells of certainty inside themselves. I cried because it’s not fair, and I’m so tired, and every woman I know is so tired. I cried because I don’t even know what it feels like to be taken seriously — not fully, not in that whole, unequivocal, confident way that’s native to handshakes between men. I cried because it does things to you to always come second. Whatever your personal opinion of the Clintons, as politicians or as human beings, that dynamic is real. We, as a culture, do not take women seriously on a profound level. We do not believe women. We do not trust women. We do not like women. I understand that many men cannot see it, and plenty more do not care. I know that many men will read this and laugh, or become defensive, or call me hysterical, or worse, and that’s fine. I am used to it. It doesn’t make me wrong. But maybe this election was the beginning of something new, I thought. Not the death of sexism, but the birth of a world in which women’s inferiority isn’t a given. That grain of hope glowed inside me until around dinner time on Tuesday, the final day of an election so openly misogynist that the question “Sexual assault: good or bad?” was credulously presented for debate. Today doesn’t feel real. It is indistinguishable from fresh, close grief. But if there’s one lesson we can take from Mrs. Clinton, politics aside — and even Donald Trump acknowledged it in the second debate — it’s the limitlessness of human endurance. Those of us who have been left in the cold by this apparent affirmation of a white supremacist patriarchy (and sorry, white women who voted for Mr. Trump, but your shelter is illusory) are tough. We have been weathering this hurricane wall of doubt and violence for so long, and now, more crystalline than ever, we have an enemy and a mandate. We have the smirking apotheosis of our oppression sliming, paw-first, toward our genitals. We have the popular vote. We have proof, in exit polls, that white women will pawn their humanity for the safety of white supremacy. We have abortion pills to stockpile and neighbors to protect and children to teach. We have the right woman to find. We have local elections in a year. The fact that we lost doesn’t make us wrong; the fact that they don’t believe in us doesn’t make us disappear.  By  Seth Grossman  A couple of years ago, I produced a reality-TV show called “Hollywood Hillbillies,” about a family from rural Georgia who, driven by the grandson’s newfound internet fame, moves west to make it in Hollywood. The show centered on the undeniable charisma of “Mema,” the foul-mouthed matriarch who spoke her mind and poked fun at the habits and attitudes of the Los Angeles elite. The show was part of a wave of “redneck reality” shows like “Swamp People,” “Duck Dynasty,” “Bayou Billionaires” and “Moonshiners” that presented a vision of white, rural America as the last authentic place on earth, the last place untarnished by the corruption and cynicism of the elites. “Hollywood Hillbillies” aired on the Reelz Network, a channel owned by a billionaire Republican donor Stanley Hubbard , who funded a pro-Trump “super” PAC after his preferred candidates lost the primaries. Designed as a harmless comedy, the show reveled in Mema’s provocative, off-color remarks, just as Donald J. Trump’s audience revels in his. But now I’m thinking more critically about what shows like this are selling. All of these shows have one thing in common: While trafficking in rural stereotypes, they celebrate wealth and business success — whether that business is crafting hick-hop music, catching alligators or designing duck calls. Ostensibly produced for middle America, they offer a population disenfranchised by globalization and the information economy a vision of rural ingenuity rewarded. Mr. Trump based his candidacy around this population. He spoke directly to voters raised on reality TV, addressing their fears and aspirations with blunt talk. He became their perfect celebrity champion, a rich white man, his image polished by years in a reality-TV boardroom, who validated their demographic anxiety. In an election season driven more by hatred of political opponents than enthusiasm for two deeply unpopular candidates, President-Elect Donald J. Trump hated best, and won. I am wondering today if the same embarrassment that prevents some of us from admitting that we watch “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” also kept Trump supporters from admitting to pollsters that they were voting for a man they knew the media considered a bigot. Two months ago, I started working on a new series, “Trumpigration,” a travel show about where to move if Donald Trump somehow got elected. That, too, was designed as a lighthearted comedy. Now, facing the prospect of four years of a Trump presidency, it’s beginning to feel like the last chance to change the channel.  By  Roberto Suro  If you are in shock over the election results, don’t blame Latinos. They favored Hillary Clinton by better than two to one, according to the exit polls. They did not turn out in big numbers to protest Donald J. Trump, but it probably would not have mattered. It turns out that Latinos were the election’s biggest losers and not just because Mr. Trump won the presidency after a long campaign of slinging threats and insults at them. The bitterest loss was dealt by the 59.5 million mostly white people who voted for Mr. Trump. That was a rejection by their own countrymen. According to the exit polls — a rough measure of turnout at best — Latinos accounted for 11 percent of the votes cast Tuesday the same as 2012. If those numbers hold, there was little or no Trump effect, and however much the number of Latino votes increased was just a result of demography. You may have been convinced that it would be otherwise. Years of reckless commentary, news stories and advocacy insisted that Latinos would be the great demographic firewall that would safeguard progressive politics with surging population numbers. But, the firewall only stands in a few states, and the biggest of them, California, New York and Texas, are already decided. Mr. Trump concentrated instead on the old industrial states where Latinos are a sparse presence. When he demonized Mexico and unauthorized immigrants, he gained more in the Electoral College by mobilizing white voters than he lost by alienating Latinos. The national exit polls show that Mrs. Clinton drew 65 percent of the Latino vote compared with 29 percent for Mr. Trump. That is a landslide by any measure, and it is about the same margin in the exit polls for 2008 (67 percent vs. 31 percent). The disappointment sets in when you compare the outcome to 2012. President Barack Obama took 71 percent of the Latino vote in the exit polls that year compared with 27 percent for Mitt Romney. Mr. Trump was supposed to be the bucket of cold water that aroused the sleeping giant, producing not only a stronger preference for the Democratic candidate but also, more important, a spike in turnout. In 2012, with immigration reform on the line, more than 12 million Latino voters stayed home, producing a turnout rate of 48 percent compared with 64 percent for whites and 67 percent for blacks. The much ballyhooed and chronicled “Trump Effect” was supposed to have produced a surge in naturalizations and voter registration over the past year, and news organizations were churning out stories about the “surge” in Latino voting even after the polls closed Tuesday. While more time and data is needed to get a full picture of Latino turnout this year, at first glance it appears Latino numbers were up, and perhaps significantly in some places, but that in fact the giant was barely stirred. Four million more Latinos were eligible to vote Tuesday than in 2012. So, no matter who was running and no matter how low the turnout, the number of Latino votes counted Tuesday was virtually certain to be higher than 2012. In fact, demographic growth alone would have guaranteed Mrs. Clinton an additional 1.3 million votes (about 1 percent of the total votes cast), even if turnout remained at the same dismal rate as 2012, and she got two-thirds of the Latino votes. In Colorado and Nevada, Latino voters surely helped keep the states blue, and under different scenarios those states could have served as the much-advertised Latino firewall. The one real bright spot for Latino Democrats Tuesday came with the election of Catherine Cortez Masto to the Senate in Nevada. That vote may illustrate what it takes to wake up the Latino electorate: a charismatic and qualified candidate, strong mediating institutions, in this case the hospitality workers’ unions in Las Vegas, and well-organized political operation like the one created by Senator Harry Reid, the retiring Democratic leader. Meanwhile, something may have happened in Texas that needs a closer look. Mr. Trump won handily, but only by a 9 percent margin. President Obama lost the state by nearly 16 points in 2012 and by almost 12 points in 2008. A lot of non-Latino newcomers have begun to change the political complexion of the state in recent years, and that formula — newcomers plus Latinos — is what flipped Colorado and Nevada in the past. Florida is the one place where Latinos might have been able to change the results of this election and didn’t. In the exit polls, Latinos accounted for 18 percent of the total vote compared with 17 in 2012, and the split was slightly more favorable to Mrs. Clinton than it was for President Obama four years ago. Mrs. Clinton’s vote tally was more than 200,000 higher than President Obama’s, but Mr. Trump’s was more than 400,000 higher than Mr. Romney’s. And therein lies the result that Latinos will have to live with for the next four years. In a state that has vividly benefited from immigration and trade, a state where Latinos have for the most part prospered and contributed to the prosperity of their neighbors, white voters mobilized to elect a candidate who would angrily erase everything Latinos represent. No one else suffered that kind of defeat on Tuesday.  By  Kevin M. Kruse  With so many predictions about this presidential campaign having turned out to be so very wrong, comparisons to the 1948 presidential race come naturally. In that election, virtually everyone predicted that the Republican Thomas Dewey would beat the “accidental president,” the Democrat, Harry Truman. Pollsters reinforced these assumptions. Elmer Roper announced that he was so sure Dewey would win that he wouldn’t even bother reporting poll results anymore. “My silence on this point can be construed as an indication that Mr. Dewey is still so clearly ahead that we might as well just listen to his inaugural address,” he said. George Gallup kept polling until mid-October, but then rested on those results, assuming the race was over. Pundits agreed. Newsweek surveyed 50 of the nation’s top political reporters in October; every single one said Dewey would win. Republicans and Democrats alike assumed the race was over. On election night, the conservative Chicago Tribune was so confident it called the race early, rushing out a banner headline that would soon be as famous as it was wrong: “Dewey Defeats Truman.” To the amazement of nearly everyone, Truman won by considerable margins. In the popular vote, he took 49.6 percent to Dewey’s 45.1 percent. In the Electoral College, he won 303 votes to Dewey’s 189. While the margins of this year’s election are narrower, the shock and confusion of pollsters and analysts seems just as pronounced. But comparisons between the Truman and Trump campaigns are not neatly drawn. Truman was an outspoken liberal, and he campaigned on preserving and expanding the accomplishments of the New Deal welfare state. He called for expansion of Social Security, more progressive forms of taxation, a higher minimum wage, and a new national system of health insurance. Truman also committed the Democratic Party, long dominated by Southern segregationists, to a new racial liberalism. Notably, he called on Congress to protect the voting rights of African-Americans. In foreign policy, Truman set America against the growing influence of the Soviet Union. In 1947, he announced the Truman Doctrine, which prompted economic aid to Europe through the Marshall Plan and military alliances through a new North Atlantic Treaty Organization. A year later, Truman challenged Soviet expansionism with the Berlin Airlift. Mr. Trump has rejected much of the substance of Truman’s campaign, but in many ways he reflected its style. Truman’s famous “whistle-stop campaign” took him to rural communities and small towns where working-class and middle-class whites felt neglected. In fiery speeches with blunt language, he singled out sources of blame. Truman went after the “do nothing” Republican Congress as a prominent foe, but also denounced an array of “special interests,” including “bloodsuckers who have offices on Wall Street.” Truman named these enemies and promised to “give ’em’ hell.” His crowds believed him and rallied to their candidate. On Election Day, he predicted there were would be “a lot of surprised pollsters.” There were. Though he had reason to gloat, Truman was gracious in victory. The day after the election, the Washington Post staff invited him to a “crow banquet.” All the newspaper pundits, radio commentators and pollsters who predicted his defeat would wear sackcloth and force down a main course of crow; the president, in white tie and tails, would be served roast turkey. Truman declined, saying he had “no desire to crow over anybody or to see anybody eat crow, figuratively or otherwise.” He added, “We should all get together now and make a country in which everybody can eat turkey whenever he pleases.” Mr. Trump is not a politician who operates by anyone else’s playbook, but perhaps in this small but important matter, he can take a lesson from history.  By  Maureen Sullivan  I have to admit it: I am loving it. As the results poured in for Donald J. Trump, I reveled in the Facebook friends who openly mourned the end of humanity. I felt gleeful in trolling the Twitter hashtag #HesNotMyPresident: “I’m laying in bed with tears streaming down my face, just thinking about the future of this country.” This was one of the biggest election upsets in history, so of course everyone is stunned. Me too. Switching among three cable news networks and several websites I wondered: Is he really going to take Florida so easily? Did they just call North Carolina for Trump? Can he possibly win Wisconsin? Pennsylvania? Yup. I rooted for Mitt Romney in 2012 and John McCain in 2008. I ran for the school board in Hoboken, N.J., and lost once before winning the following year. I know what it’s like to have your hopes puddle up on the floor like that dollop of election-night Haagen-Dazs that you dropped and you just don’t care to wipe up. What does it matter? All is lost. You want to announce on Twitter that you are in bed letting the tears stream down your face. I saw this result coming over the summer. In July, five police officers were ambushed in Dallas and three more were killed in Baton Rouge. In August, Colin Kaepernick, the San Francisco 49ers quarterback, sat out the national anthem. In September, an Islamic terrorist, masquerading as a fried chicken salesman in my hometown, Elizabeth, N.J., set off bombs in New York and New Jersey. Mrs. Clinton proclaimed: “I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police.” She put half of Trump’s supporters in that “basket of deplorables.” People I know were angry. They were tired of being told they were racist and bigoted as they went about the business of mowing their lawns, writing college tuition checks and working their jobs as cops, secretaries and teachers’ aides. They kept being told they needed to look inward, examine their sins and judge themselves guilty. They had not forgotten when Barack Obama was running for president in 2008 and his wife, Michelle, said, “For the first time in my adult lifetime, I’m really proud of my country…” So now we have President-Elect Donald Trump. I supported him because he promised to curb regulations, cut taxes and appoint constitutionalists to the Supreme Court. I supported him because Mrs. Clinton doesn’t have what it takes to turn around a stagnant economy or stand up to the special interests that block innovation. In his victory speech, Mr. Trump lifted a line from Abraham Lincoln and spoke of “binding wounds.” I wanted him to be gracious and kind in that moment, and he was. My 89-year-old mother is still appalled by my vote and tells me, with a laugh, that she’s moving to Ireland. And one of my disappointed female friends on Facebook — who, like me is white and college-educated — wrote, “Obama helped expose the deeply racist nature of our country. Trump exposes the anti-intellectual, sexist xenophobia.” But most of my friends, some of whom I suspect cast votes like mine, have stayed quiet. I guess it’s still not politically correct to admit that you are on the Trump train.  By  Viet Thanh Nguyen  Worst-case scenario in the next four years: fascism, a wall, mass deportations, the end of Obamacare, a Trump brand on the White House and either a trade war or an actual war with China (since war is the easiest diversion from domestic unhappiness). Best-case scenario: Ruth Bader Ginsburg refuses to retire or die, the Democratic Party finds a backbone, turns away from its fixation on the center and heeds the call for an economic revolt against the 1 percent, joined by Black Lives Matter, the Occupy movement, and resurgent feminism. Both scenarios could happen at the same time. The second scenario requires Democrats to put their status quo political model to rest. They already had a significant portion of the nonwhite minority vote locked up, but have lost too many working-class white people. Bernie Sanders might not have won over the wealthier whites who were voting with Trump against the seemingly rising tide of minorities, but he might have snared the white working class and some of the white middle class. Here’s the bright side, for those, like me, who are on the liberal-to-left spectrum. If Hillary Clinton had won, she would have run again in 2020, which could have meant four more years of Wall Street liberalism and fire-and-forget perpetual warfare, conducted by drones and Special Operations over the horizon. Now perhaps Elizabeth Warren will be the 2020 Democratic candidate — a white woman, a feminist, and someone more progressive than Clinton. But all this speaks largely about domestic electoral politics. The sickness of the American body politic remains untreated, and will remain untreated, or exacerbated, in a country run by clowns, conspirators, and collaborators. That sickness is imperialism. America is an imperial country, and its decay might now be showing. The power that has brought so much benefit to the country — for white people — is now faltering in its ability to provide those benefits to all white people. The empire’s best hope is to be more inclusive, demographically and economically, but that runs counter to the imperial impulse to hoard power and profit. Warren or someone like her might be better at extracting more social and economic justice for all Americans. But unless such a person finds a way to ease control from the financial-industrial complex, the prospects of halting our decline are weak. Empires rot from the inside even as emperors blame the barbarians.  By  Robert N. Stavins  Donald J. Trump once tweeted that “the concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing noncompetitive.” Twitter messages may not be clear signs of likely public policies, but Mr. Trump followed up during the campaign with his “America First Energy Plan,” which would rescind all of President Obama’s actions on climate change. The plan includes canceling United States participation in the Paris climate agreement and stopping all American funding of United Nations climate change programs. It also includes abandoning the Clean Power Plan, a mainstay of the Obama administration’s approach to achieving its emissions reduction target for carbon dioxide under the Paris agreement. What should we make of such campaign promises? Taking Mr. Trump at his word, he will surely seek to pull the country out of the Paris pact. But because the agreement has already come into force, under the rules, any party must wait three years before requesting to withdraw, followed by a one-year notice period. Those rules would seem to be mere technicalities. The incoming Trump administration simply can disregard America’s pledge to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 26 to 28 percent below the 2005 level by 2025. That is bad enough. But the big worry is what other key countries, including the world’s largest emitter, China, as well as India and Brazil, will do if the United States reneges on its pledge. The result could be that the Paris agreement unravels, taking it from the 97 percent of global emissions currently covered by the pact to little more than the European Union’s 10 percent share. In addition, Mr. Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency probably will stop work on regulations of methane emissions (a very potent greenhouse gas) from existing oil and gas operations. Undoing complex existing regulations, such as the Clean Power Plan, will be more difficult, but a reconstituted Supreme Court will probably help President Trump when that plan inevitably comes before the court. Also, the new president will most likely ask that the Keystone XL pipeline permit application be renewed — and facilitate other oil and gas pipelines around the country. On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump promised to “bring back” the coal industry by cutting environmental regulations. That may not be so easy. The decline of that industry and related employment has been caused by technological changes in mining, and competition from low-priced natural gas for electricity generation, not by environmental regulations. At the same time, Mr. Trump has pledged to promote fracking for oil and gas, but that would make natural gas even more economically attractive, and accelerate the elimination of coal-sector jobs. If he lives up to his campaign rhetoric, Mr. Trump may indeed be able to reverse course on climate change policy, increasing the threat to our planet, and in the process destroy much of the Obama legacy in this important realm. This will make the states even more important players on this critical issue.  By  Dani Rodrik  The real costs of a Donald J. Trump presidency will most likely come on the political rather than on the economic side. We are likely to see some rise in trade barriers and unilateral economic policies. But for all his bluster, I do not expect Mr. Trump to engage in indiscriminate protectionism. We live in a world of supply chains where imposing tariffs on Mexican or Chinese imports will raise costs of United States businesses and make it hard for them to compete. Mr. Trump is a businessman, and he will understand soon, if he does not now, the senselessness of blanket protectionism. We may have plenty of trade disputes with foreign countries. It’s useful to bear in mind here the example of the 1980s, when trade frictions with Japan and other leading exporters produced a slew of so-called new protectionist barriers such as voluntary export restraints. But these did very limited damage to the world economy. Before long, the world embarked on a further and more intense round of globalization. Furthermore, we have robust international institutions, like the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization, that did not exist in the interwar period. And the political lobbies in favor of an open economy (big business and banks) are stronger and retain considerable influence in Washington. So even though the 1930s parallel is on everyone’s mind, I do not think we are in for a collapse of the international economic order and a retreat into trade war. The real danger Mr. Trump poses is the undermining of our politics — the norms that sustain our liberal democracies. His campaign was based on a divisive politics of identity. Ideals of equity, equal rights, diversity and inclusion were submerged under the weight of a rhetoric that raised racial and ethnic tensions and inflamed passions against imagined enemies — Mexican immigrants, Chinese exporters, Muslim refugees. Illiberal democracy has been the bane of several nations around the world. Under Mr. Trump, the traditions in the United States of checks and balances and of rule of law will be tested seriously. The political danger will be greatly magnified by Mr. Trump’s likely economic failure. He comes into office as the putative leader of middle and lower classes who feel they have been left behind. He has raised their expectations in ways that he cannot meet. There is little chance that incomes at the middle and lower end of income distribution will receive a large boost under his policies. The manufacturing jobs that have left will not return no matter how tough Mr. Trump’s trade policies get. These jobs have disappeared for good, largely thanks to technological changes, and not trade. When the full scale of his economic disappointment sinks in sometime during his term, Mr. Trump may well react in the time-honored fashion of global populists like President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. To keep his base mobilized and insulate himself from economic troubles, he may take shelter in an intensified form of the identity politics that worked so well for him during the presidential campaign. This would rip American society further apart along racial and ethnic cleavages. The ugliness that characterized politics during the presidential campaign may be nothing compared with what may be yet to come.  By  Teresa Tritch  Financial markets regained their footing on Wednesday, as investors and traders apparently concluded that a Donald Trump presidency might not be so bad after all. Instead of focusing on how unprepared Mr. Trump is to be president, several traders quoted in the media talked about how deregulation from ending Obamacare and the Dodd-Frank financial reforms — two Republican goals — could lift stock prices for health care companies and banks. They took special solace in Mr. Trump’s promise to boost government spending on infrastructure and in the measured tones of his acceptance speech. Unfortunately, there is no escaping the overarching conclusion that Mr. Trump’s campaign promises, if carried out, would harm the economy. His proposed rollback of Dodd-Frank reforms would invite renewed recklessness. His opposition to Obamacare would renew and intensify households’ financial insecurity. His proposed tax cuts for the rich would exacerbate income inequality, while either blowing a hole in the deficit or requiring deep budget cuts. His stance on trade would impair international commerce and cooperation. His proposed deportation of immigrants would unleash a legal and humanitarian crisis. Even his popular call for more infrastructure spending is flawed. In and of itself, Mr. Trump’s pledge to borrow vast sums to spend on infrastructure would be a sensible move at this time of low interest rates. But vastly increased federal indebtedness in addition to his other harmful economic policies would be piling risk on top of risk. Risk-taking that crosses the line into recklessness can be immensely profitable in the short run, which is what many traders care most about. But it is no way to run an economy on which everyone else depends for long-term prosperity.  By  Emily Bazelon  Now it looks like a warning shot. When Justice Antonin Scalia died in February, Donald Trump was among the first to call for stonewalling President Obama’s choice to fill the seat. “It’s called delay, delay, delay,” he said at the opening of the Republican presidential debate on Feb. 13. Senator Harry Reid, the minority leader, countered that it would be “unprecedented in recent history” for the Supreme Court to go a year without a full complement of justices. But other Republicans, chief among them the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, agreed with Mr. Trump and Senator Ted Cruz: Justice Scalia’s seat should remain vacant until after the election. Undeterred (what else was he supposed to be?), President Obama nominated Merrick Garland, a seasoned judge praised in the past by Republicans like Senator Orrin Hatch. A debate ensued over historical facts, which seems quaintly polite in retrospect. Since 1900, had the Senate ever refused to confirm a nominee in a presidential election year as a result of the impending election? The answer was no (even if Mr. Cruz tried to argue, against the facts, that Justice Anthony Kennedy wasn’t confirmed in the election year of 1988.) The Republicans’ refusal to grant Judge Garland a hearing or schedule a vote was in fact unprecedented. It was a new kind of hardball. And it succeeded. For a blip in August, Republicans took a hit in the polls for  obstructing the Garland nomination. But the moment passed, blown away in the chaos and battle of the presidential election. Judge Garland slipped from view. The parties adapted to a new reality in which both expected either his postelection, pre-inauguration confirmation, or a new nominee chosen by the next president. When they assumed Hillary Clinton would win, Republicans including Senators John McCain of Arizona  and Richard Burr of North Carolina talked about blocking Democratic Supreme Court picks indefinitely. Both were re-elected Tuesday and will return to a Senate still controlled by the Republicans. It’s hard to see how any Republican paid a price for radically altering the norms for Supreme Court appointments. Mr. Trump helped point the way, and the voters rewarded him and those who followed. Choosing a justice in Antonin Scalia’s mold, as he has promised, will allow Mr. Trump to prove himself to the social conservatives for whom the court, and Roe v. Wade, are the defining issues. Under the current rules, Democrats could filibuster his choice, but if that happens, how long will those rules last? 
Mr. Trump’s election has already run over far stronger traditions and norms. Next comes the question of how many additional Supreme Court appointments will come his way. Ruth Bader Ginsburg is 83. Anthony Kennedy is 80. Stephen Breyer is 78. In Supreme Court terms, four years is a long time.  By  Peter Wehner  To say that Donald Trump’s victory was a shock may qualify as the understatement of the century. The polls were wrong. The experts were wrong. I was wrong. Almost everyone was wrong — including those in the Trump campaign who expected to lose. His victory wasn’t just a surprise; it was an event of gigantic dimensions, its radiating effects incalculable. Mr. Trump’s win ranks among the most unlikely and stunning elections in American history. Regardless of how the Trump presidency turns out, this race will be studied a century from now. For those of us who have been vehement critics of Mr. Trump, this is a rather challenging moment. Starting on Jan. 20, he will be the only president we have. He now has a democratic legitimacy we may regret but cannot deny, and there is such a thing as democratic grace. To those who are tempted only to rage and attack and lament what has occurred, a word of counsel to them, and to myself: We need to give Mr. Trump the chance to rise to the moment, as unlikely as we think that may be. At the same time, we can’t possibly erase the history of the last 17 months — the words he said, the things he did, the conspiracy theories he wove, the ignorance, volatility and cruelty he showed — and our concerns aren’t going to evaporate now that he’s about to be in charge of the nuclear triad that during the campaign he didn’t even know existed. I believed, and still believe, that he is a man with a disordered personality and authoritarian tendencies. My job is to give him a chance to prove me wrong; his job is to prove me wrong. Among my worries is that Mr. Trump’s victory will validate his style of politics, his serrated rhetoric. The way he mistreats people will be normalized. This election has brought us to dark places. Rather than this approach being repudiated it will, for many, become a model. “All the decent drapery of life is to be rudely torn off,” in the words of Edmund Burke. If the Trump campaign foreshadows his presidency, America under Trump will be fundamentally different than it has been — coarser, less temperate and civilized, more inward and resentful. The Republican Party will fundamentally change, from a conservative party to one that champions European-style ethnic nationalism. (The Democratic Party, whose members were certain Hillary Clinton would win, will be convulsed as it enters a period of intense recrimination.) A few hours after Mr. Trump was declared the winner, I received a note from a friend of mine, the distinguished Christian writer Philip Yancey, who told me, “I’m surprised and befuddled, but not scared, thanks to the checks-and-balances strength of American democracy. I tremble, though, to think what an unpredictable leader offers to a world in growing crisis.” He added, “Some say God moves in mysterious ways.  I say, God grants humans the freedom to move in even more mysterious ways.” What happened on Nov. 8th was a mystery that may lead to calamity. I hope to God it won’t.  By  Anna North  I spent the days leading up to the election in Pennsylvania talking to some young voters , 18, 19, 20 years old. They wore flowered Doc Martens, fake fur coats, earbuds dangling from one ear. Overwhelmingly, they were open and polite. They were smart. They were angry at a political system they felt ignored them, but they hoped for better days ahead. In January, Donald Trump will be their next president. Many of these young people supported Mr. Trump. Many did so reluctantly. One young Trump supporter told me that no one knows exactly what Mr. Trump will do in office. Another described hesitating while filling out his absentee ballot, wondering if he could vote for a man who had made abhorrent comments about women. But some voted for Mr. Trump enthusiastically. Those who supported Hillary Clinton were disgusted by Mr. Trump and what he stands for. Today, they’re dealing with a new reality they didn’t expect. I’m thinking of Bria Blackshear, a 20-year-old Temple University student who had waited more than an hour at her polling place in north Philadelphia. “Donald Trump doesn’t represent the ideals I would want for this country,” she said. I’m thinking of Brooke Renner, 18, also a Temple student, who was waiting in line for a second time. She’d given up earlier, but was back and willing to wait as long as it took to cast her vote for Mrs. Clinton. Otherwise, she said, “I’d feel personally responsible if Donald Trump wins.” I’m thinking of Sierra Taylor, a 19-year-old student at the Community College of Philadelphia, who said, “black people feel like our votes don’t matter.” I’m thinking of her friend Naiya Johnson, 22, who, when asked about her hopes for the next four years, said, “I hope we make it.” I’m also thinking of the young people I saw debating the issues that matter to them. Of the table full of young men at Bucks County Community College arguing about Mr. Trump when one, the quietest, spoke up to say, “Trump has no respect for women.” Of the young man, who, as his friend criticized Mrs. Clinton’s record as secretary of state, interjected that Mr. Trump is racist, sexist and xenophobic. They’d had the argument once before, they said. I hope they keep talking. I think they will. It’s a frightening time to grow up. But these young voters are clear-eyed about the shortcomings of government and optimistic enough to imagine a better world. They can make friends with people of different viewpoints, and, when it matters, they can challenge their friends to think in a new way.  By  Seamus McGraw  BRODHEADSVILLE, Pa. — Thinking back now, I can’t for the life of me figure out how I got it so wrong. He seemed so troubled by what he was about to do, as if he knew it was a mistake, but one he felt compelled to make. The way I read the pained look on his face, I thought he was almost apologizing; maybe seeking a kind of absolution. It was just a few days before the election, and I had been canvassing for the Democrats. I wasn’t out there because I was a particularly ardent Clinton supporter. She had certainly not been my first choice, my second or even my third. I’m one of those middle-aged white men without a college degree who had been holding out for Joe Biden to change his mind. But I felt as if I had an obligation to make certain that, at least in my little corner of Pennsylvania, a man who was, to my mind, so obviously unsuited to the highest office in the world, was not just defeated, but repudiated. I expected that my neighbors and friends and the strangers down the road would do just that. Sure, I could feel and even share their frustration over the fact that the longest postwar economic recovery had left so many of my neighbors behind. I had been left behind, too. And yes, I understood the fear of an uncertain world, and the stress of profound cultural changes that were upending so many things that my neighbors took as bedrock values. But I thought the character traits that had always defined the people I knew in eastern Pennsylvania — true conservatives with a sense of responsibility and decency — would in the end lead them to reject “Trumpism,” whatever that actually is. My job wasn’t to help Clinton win. I thought — or at least the pundits were telling me — that was a done deal. The way I saw it, my only task was to drive up her margins and to do that, I was working off a carefully curated list of likely Clinton voters thoughtfully provided to me by the local campaign office. And so when I knocked on this gentleman’s door on a back road in the rural, conservative West End of Monroe County, and he told me that he was indeed planning on voting for Donald Trump, I was ready to simply turn away. But he wouldn’t let me go. “I just can’t trust her,” he said. He made eye contact and kept it. Relentlessly. He and I were of the same rough demographic. Just like me, he was well into his 50s, with teeth that had seen better days. Just like me, he was lower middle class, judging from his surroundings. And as he rattled off a list of shopworn talking points — Benghazi, emails, pay for play — I felt as if I was hearing a stranger’s confession. I felt as if he wanted me to understand and forgive him for what he was about to do. I remember thinking to myself that when this was over, I was going to have to find a way to build a bridge back to this guy who was, in so many ways, just like me. Such was my arrogance. Late last night, as I watched Pennsylvania turn red for the first time in a generation, I kept thinking back to that man, and how I so misread his expression and his words. It wasn’t sorrow etched in his face. It was pity. For me. Because he knew, long before I did, how wrong I was.  —  Seamus McGraw is the author of “Betting the Farm on a Drought.”   By  Beverly Gage  In his victory speech last night, Donald J. Trump paid homage to “the forgotten men and women of our country,” vowing that they “will be forgotten no longer.” This essential political idea — that a vast segment of the nation’s white citizens have been overlooked, or looked down upon — has driven every major realignment in American politics since the New Deal. In 1932, at the darkest moment of the Great Depression, Franklin Roosevelt evoked the “forgotten man” as a reason to rebuild the economy from the “bottom up.” More than three decades later, after Richard Nixon’s 1968 victory, the journalist Peter Schrag identified the “Forgotten American” — the white “lower middle class” voter — as the key to the nation’s apparent rejection of the Great Society and the New Deal order. “In the guise of the working class — or the American yeoman or John Smith — he was once the hero of the civic books, the man that Andrew Jackson called ‘the bone and sinew of the country,’ ” Mr. Schrag wrote. “Now he is ‘the forgotten man,’ perhaps the most alienated person in America.” That this “forgotten” American could be used both to uphold and to dismantle liberalism suggests that this American political identity has never been especially fixed: Democrat or Republican, liberal or conservative, but populist above all. Since the 1960s, the phrase has also implied that the country was paying too much attention to the wrong sorts of people — most notably, to African-Americans — at the expense of the white working class.
It is no coincidence that the “forgotten men and women of our country” began their migration into the Republican Party at the very moment that African-Americans were asserting their right to vote, and voting Democratic, in large numbers for the first time. Mr. Trump’s victory will go down as one of the great upsets in United States history, but it is also the product of a long and bitter struggle over race and class in this country. The Yale sociologist William Graham Sumner is often credited with coining the term “forgotten man.” Writing near the dawn of the Progressive Era, he lamented the lost autonomy of hard-working citizens suddenly forced to pay for high-flown programs of social reform. Sumner’s most famous political essay, “What the Social Classes Owe to Each Other,” rejected the very idea that government might mitigate class antagonisms by sharing the social wealth. What did social classes owe to each other? Not much, in Sumner’s view. And his “forgotten man” owed the least of all. In his 1932 campaign for the presidency, Roosevelt sought to claim the term for a different and more expansive purpose. “These unhappy times call for the building of plans that rest upon the forgotten,” he said in a radio address from Albany in April 1932, for plans “that build from the bottom up and not from the top down, that put their faith once more in the forgotten man at the bottom of the economic pyramid.” To Roosevelt, the “forgotten man” encompassed the industrial worker and struggling farmer and Keynesian consumer — ordinary citizens without whom a modern economy would falter. He built the New Deal around this image, establishing the minimum wage, Social Security and the federal right to organize unions. Those reforms cemented the loyalty of the white working class to the Democratic Party for a generation. But the New Deal also “forgot” — or excluded — many people, including African-Americans. When the Great Society came along, Lyndon Johnson tried to make up for that by expanding federal programs serving the poor and by championing the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts. As the country started to “remember” its long-delayed promises of equality, however, the “forgotten American” began to emerge as term of exclusion and resistance to change. “There is hardly a language to describe him, or even a set of social statistics,” Mr. Schrag wrote in his August 1969 essay, “ The Forgotten American .” “Just names: racist-bigot-redneck-ethnic-Irish-Italian-Pole-Hunkie-Yahoo. The lower middle class. A blank.” As Mr. Schrag noted, all of that name-calling was part of the problem, a refusal on the part of liberal elites to recognize the real grievances and desires of what had once been a bedrock Democratic constituency. In the 1968 campaign, Nixon capitalized on this resentment with calls for “law and order,” a phrase that evoked not only fears of crime, but also anger at protesters and rioters and the college-campus liberals who tolerated them. Mr. Trump put that phrase back into political circulation in 2016, a gesture of solidarity with the old ways of thinking about the “silent majority” — and the “forgotten American.” And though he included “men and women” in his victory speech, Mr. Trump’s campaign mobilized around the same image that once animated the Roosevelt coalition: the “forgotten” white working-class man. Race, too, remains an indelible part of today’s conversation about who has been “forgotten” and who deserves to be seen. To dismiss this language as simple racism, however, is to miss at least some of its political significance. What happened in the late 1960s and 1970s was not only that the Republican Party reclaimed and redefined Roosevelt’s “forgotten man” for a more conservative age. During those years, the Democratic Party itself began to turn away from the New Deal and its working-class politics, especially from its commitment to organized labor. With Mr. Trump’s election, we may be witnessing the rise of a new party system, with the Democrats now the standard-bearers of racial tolerance and free-market globalization, and the Republicans the party of nationalist populist revolt. But as Roosevelt showed, this need not be a fixed political equation. If the 2016 election marks the final, gasping end of the New Deal coalition, it should also mark the start of a new reckoning within the Democratic Party.  By  Helen Lewis  LONDON — You can’t throw a peanut in a Westminster pub without hitting an obsessive follower of American politics. Start a conversation about “The West Wing” with any member of Parliament and expect to get a long disquisition on that American political drama’s best episodes. During Britain’s last general election, in 2015, both main political parties here proudly boasted about being advised by veterans of Barack Obama’s campaign. Until now, our Americophilia has been unrequited. Then in August, Donald J. Trump declared himself “Mr. Brexit.” For Mr. Trump and his supporters, Britain’s vote in June to leave the European Union was evidence of a growing popular revolt against multiculturalism, porous borders and political elites. If the British electorate could deliver a result that baffled its financial sector, its scientists and metropolitan liberals – and was not widely predicted by pollsters – couldn’t the same sort of upset happen in America? It just did. Mr. Trump’s victory feels like a flashback to June, although where Brexit divided members of Britain’s political class, the American election results have united them. Politicians of the mainstream right and left alike are dumbfounded that the United States  would elect someone who uses the extreme language Mr. Trump does and who seems to have little love for institutions like NATO. Last December, Britain’s former Conservative prime minister, David Cameron, described Mr. Trump’s proposed ban on Muslims entering America as “divisive, stupid and wrong.” The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan of the Labour Party, has called the president-elect’s views on Islam “ignorant.” Apart from Nigel Farage, the face of the far-right U.K. Independence Party, it is difficult to find a British politician with a good word to say about Mr. Trump. Nationalism, white anger and protectionism are now driving politics in Britain and across Europe. The sound is of doors slamming. Brexit felt like a referendum on border control, and on rapid demographic change among white communities that felt themselves deprived of attention and resources. It is tempting to draw comparisons with the United States: The big cities in both Britain and the United States, which are most diverse, are also most relaxed about that diversity. In smaller communities, immigration feels more disruptive. There are other parallels. Mr. Trump’s victory was driven by older, white voters, who were struggling but not destitute. He won white men without college degrees by a landslide. A typical Leave supporter has a similar demographic profile. Such voters are on the decline, as both Britain and the United States become more diverse and younger generations are better-educated, and more open to immigration and change. But as both the Brexit vote and Mr. Trump’s victory showed, they are far from a spent force.  By  Susan Chira  Women, as Hillary Clinton showed this morning , know how to absorb pain. And Mrs. Clinton has had plenty of practice about how to stand before the cameras after public humiliation. Clearly, she needed time to compose herself. She made no appearances overnight, instead calling Donald J. Trump to concede. But when she strode onstage in purple and gray, Bill Clinton behind her in a purple tie, her voice did not waver. Women seldom have the luxury of giving in to pain. Many have children or grandchildren or aging parents to tend, whether they themselves are sick or in emotional turmoil. So Mrs. Clinton faced her despondent campaign staff and her despondent half of the country and tried to rally them. She spoke most directly to young people, and to women and girls. She had hoped to stand before them as a symbol of all that women could achieve. Now she had to demonstrate once again what women can endure. “I’ve had successes and setbacks, sometimes really painful ones,” she told them. It was hard not to recall her standing beside Bill Clinton after the whole world knew graphic and humiliating details about the affairs he had denied having. “To all the women and especially the young women who put their faith in me I want you to know that nothing has made me prouder than to be your champion,” she said, and here she had to clear her throat. “I know we still have not shattered that highest and hardest glass ceiling but some day somebody will, and hopefully sooner than we might think right now.” It’s difficult to know right now all that stood in the way of shattering that ceiling. Was it a woman, or this woman? Was it Mrs. Clinton as symbol of the Washington establishment, as a consummate insider in a time of profound distrust of the elite? We do know that voters disproportionately punish women who are seen as dishonest. We do know that it’s hard for strong, assertive and ambitious women to be seen as likable and competent at the same time. Political scientists and cultural commentators will long debate what happened in this election, to this woman and to many women.  The question is whether the image of Mrs. Clinton, composed and gracious in defeat, persevering through pain, will inspire women to try again?  By  Felix Salmon  Markets always move after seismic events, like the unexpected election of Donald J. Trump. Still, market moves need to be interpreted. Even if you believe that markets are right, it’s not always obvious what they’re saying. One way to think about the market’s gyrations is the idea of mean and variation. When Barack Obama (a.k.a. No Drama Obama) was elected president, it was possible to anticipate — correctly, it turned out — that he would help steer America back onto a course of steady growth, low inflation and falling unemployment. Think of that as the Obama mean: the baseline expectation. When the stock market expects good things like that, it tends to rise, just as it has during the Obama presidency. But the variation is just as important as the mean. Mr. Obama didn’t always give the markets what they wanted, but by the same token he was always clear about what he was going to do. He promised them something much more valuable: a low-risk upward economic trajectory. Mr. Trump is the exact opposite of Mr. Obama. His baseline is worse, for starters: to establish expectations for his presidency, you have to factor in his hugely irresponsible fiscal policy, potential trade wars and maybe even reckless brinkmanship over repaying the national debt. Put those things together, and a severe recession becomes possible. But it gets even worse because Mr. Trump is by his nature highly unpredictable. However bad you think he’s going to be, it’s entirely possible that your prediction will turn out to be ridiculously optimistic. Mr. Trump has vastly more downside risk than Mr. Obama ever had, and so markets are going to trade at a discount to his already-discounted baseline. If you transition, then, from low-risk positive expectations to high-risk negative expectations, you have to expect the markets to take some precipitous plunges along the way. Much of that will be noise. The markets always fluctuate randomly in the short term, and there’s no point in trying to read anything meaningful into those moves. That’s why it’s dangerous to read too much into midnight stock-market futures trading, or a sudden plunge in the value of the Mexican peso once it becomes obvious that Mr. Trump will become president. Those moves might be a rational response to the lower expected value of the assets in question. On the other hand, they might just be the result of panicky hedging — or indeed they could simply represent dealers second-guessing and trying to outmaneuver one another. Once the market has been trading steadily for a few months, its general direction under the auspices of the new government is going to be pretty clear. Fluctuations over just a few hours, by contrast, are much harder to read. They might look like signals — but all too often they turn out to be nothing but noise. And as we’ve learned during this long, brutal election, separating noise from signals can be a very tricky business.  By  Michael Lerner  It turns out that shaming the supporters of Donald J. Trump is not a good political strategy. Though job loss and economic stagnation played a role in his victory, so did shame. As the principal investigator on a study of the middle class for the National Institute of Mental Health, I found that working people’s stress is often intensified by shame at their failure to “make it” in what they are taught is a meritocratic American economy. The right has been very successful at persuading working people that they are vulnerable not because they themselves have failed, but because of the selfishness of some other villain (African-Americans, feminists, immigrants, Muslims, Jews, liberals, progressives; the list keeps growing). Instead of challenging this ideology of shame, the left has buttressed it by blaming white people as a whole for slavery, genocide of the Native Americans and a host of other sins, as though whiteness itself was something about which people ought to be ashamed. The rage many white working-class people feel in response is rooted in the sense that once again, as has happened to them throughout their lives, they are being misunderstood. So please understand what is happening here. Many Trump supporters very legitimately feel that it is they who have been facing an unfair reality. The upper 20 percent of income earners, many of them quite liberal and rightly committed to the defense of minorities and immigrants, also believe in the economic meritocracy and their own right to have so much more than those who are less fortunate. So while they may be progressive on issues of discrimination against the obvious victims of racism and sexism, they are blind to their own class privilege and to the hidden injuries of class that are internalized by much of the country as self-blame. The right’s ability to portray liberals as elitists is further strengthened by the phobia toward religion that prevails in the left. Many religious people are drawn by the teachings of their tradition to humane values and caring about the oppressed. Yet they often find that liberal culture is hostile to religion of any sort, believing it is irrational and filled with hate. People on the left rarely open themselves to the possibility that there could be a spiritual crisis in society that plays a role in the lives of many who feel misunderstood and denigrated by the fancy intellectuals and radical activists. The left needs to stop ignoring people’s inner pain and fear. The racism, sexism and xenophobia used by Mr. Trump to advance his candidacy does not reveal an inherent malice in the majority of Americans. If the left could abandon all this shaming, it could rebuild its political base by helping Americans see that much of people’s suffering is rooted in the hidden injuries of class and in the spiritual crisis that the global competitive marketplace generates. Democrats need to become as conscious and articulate about the suffering caused by classism as we are about other forms of suffering. We need to reach out to Trump voters in a spirit of empathy and contrition. Only then can we help working people understand that they do not live in a meritocracy, that their intuition that the system is rigged is correct (but it is not by those whom they had been taught to blame) and that their pain and rage is legitimate."
"How Much Of The World Is In a Liquidity Trap?","As I’ve written many times in various contexts since the crisis began, being in a liquidity trap reverses many of the usual rules of economic policy. Virtue becomes vice: attempts to save more actually make us poorer, in both the short and the long run. Prudence becomes folly: a stern determination to balance budgets and avoid any risk of inflation is the road to disaster. Mercantilism works: countries that subsidize exports and restrict imports actually do gain at their trading partners’ expense. For the moment — or more likely for the next several years — we’re living in a world in which none of what you learned in Econ 101 applies. But what’s the definition of a liquidity trap? How much of the world is in one? There’s a lot of confusion on that point; here’s how I see it. In my analysis, you’re in a liquidity trap when conventional open-market operations — purchases of short-term government debt by the central bank — have lost traction, because short-term rates are close to zero. Now, you may object that there are other things central banks can do, and that they actually do these things to some extent: they can purchase longer-term government securities or other assets, they can try to raise their inflation targets in a credible way. And I very much want the Fed to do more of these things. But the reality is that unconventional monetary policy is difficult, perceived as risky, and never pursued with the vigor of conventional monetary policy. Consider the Fed, which under Bernanke is more adventurous than it would have been under anyone else. Even so, it has gone nowhere near engaging in enough unconventional expansion to offset the limitations created by the zero lower bound. A while back Goldman estimated that if it weren’t for the lower bound, the current Fed funds rate would be minus 5 percent, and that to achieve the same effect as a further 5 points of Fed funds cuts the Fed would have to expand its balance sheet to $10 trillion; I wouldn’t stake my life on those estimates, but they seem in the right ballpark. Obviously, the Fed isn’t doing that. Or put it a different way: suppose the real economic outlook were the same as it is — with all indications being that unemployment will stay very high for years to come — but that the current Fed funds rate were, say, 4 percent. Clearly the Fed would feel obliged to engage in a lot more expansion, cutting rates sharply and rapidly. But with short-term rates at zero, the Fed is instead merely on hold — it is not expanding its quantitative easing, and is in fact in the process of pulling back. The point is that while you can think of things the Fed can do even at the zero lower bound, that lower bound is in practice a major constraint on policy. By all means let’s yell at the Fed to do more, but when you’re considering other issues — like the effects of fiscal policy or the effects of renminbi undervaluation — you have to assess them in terms of the central bank you have, not the central bank you wish you had. And by that criterion, how much of the world is currently in a liquidity trap? Almost all advanced countries. The US, obviously; Japan, even more obviously; the eurozone, because the ECB probably couldn’t engage in Fed-style quantitative easing even if it wanted to, given the lack of a single backing government; Britain. Not Australia, I guess. But still: essentially the whole advanced world, accounting for 70 percent of world GDP at market prices , is in a liquidity trap.

"","Former Russian spy chief Nikolai Patrushev challenges western perspectives on the standoff between Moscow and Kiev in an interview with Rossiyskaya Gazeta  Fri 24 Oct 2014 10.25 BST   Last modified on Wed 12 Apr 2017 15.23 BST   Nikolai Patrushev: Our experts warned that a worsening of the situation in Ukraine was likely under conditions of political and economic instability, particularly in the case of outside influence. But I have to admit that the possibility of a sudden seizure of power in Kiev, relying on armed units of self-proclaimed Nazis, hadn’t then been considered. It’s worth remembering that until that coup, Moscow fulfilled all its obligations to Kiev in full. Without the material and financial help that we constantly supplied, Ukraine wouldn’t have been able to deal with its economic problems, which had become chronic. To help our neighbour, we marshalled material and financial resources worth tens of millions of dollars. For many people in Ukraine, this help came to seem so routine that they simply forgot how important it was for the survival of the country. But if you’re talking about longer-term predictions, the Ukraine crisis was a totally predictable outcome of the actions of the US and its closest allies. A whole generation of Ukrainians [have been] brought up to hate Russia and believe in the mythology of ‘European values’ For the last quarter of a century, these actions were designed to wrest Ukraine and other former Soviet republics away from Russia and to redesign the post-Soviet space in America’s interests. The US created the conditions and pretexts for the coloured revolutions and financed them lavishly. Victoria Nuland, the US assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, has said that her country spent $5bn between 1991 and 2013 “supporting the aspirations of the people of Ukraine for a stronger, more democratic government”. Even open sources, such as congressional documents, show that government spent no less than $2.4bn on various American “aid” programmes to Ukraine between 2001 and 2012. That’s comparable to the annual budget of some small states. The US Agency for International Development spent around half a billion dollars, the State Department nearly half a million and the Pentagon more than $370m. According to Congress, organisations like Millennium Challenge Corporation, the Peace Corps and the Open World Center participated in aid programmes to Ukraine, in addition to USAID and other government agencies. It is not hard to guess why and for whom American volunteers and diplomatic missions have been “opening up the world” in the 23 years since the fall of the Soviet Union. Nikolai Patrushev: I don’t know if its possible to talk of good causes if you consider that as a result of this activity, a whole generation in Ukraine was brought up to hate Russia and believe in the mythology of “European values”. This generation doesn’t grasp that these values, even if they are given a positive spin, are not, in fact, meant for Ukrainians. No one intends to raise the standard of living in Ukraine or to provide for young Ukrainians in a Europe that is itself struggling with very serious challenges and threats. Ukraine simply cannot prosper without Russia, whether it likes it or not ... The complete severing of these ties would be a painful blow for Russia but it would be a catastrophe for Ukraine I think that when Ukrainians do come to their senses, it will be difficult and painful. We can only hope that this happens quite fast. Rapid disillusionment is possible for a whole range of reasons. I want to mention one more factor that is crucial. However events develop from here, the importance that Russia and Ukraine represent for one another will endure. Ukraine simply cannot prosper without Russia, whether it likes it or not. That interdependence of economic, logistical and other ties evolved over centuries. The complete severing of these ties would be a painful blow for Russia but it would be a catastrophe for Ukraine. Not for nothing was President Petro Poroshenko forced to delay implementing the economic part of the Association Agreement with the EU, just as his ousted predecessor was. I expect that the victorious euphoria amongst Kiev’s other rulers will give way to a more sober assessment of the real state of affairs. Nikolai Patrushev: Yes, if the catastrophe in Ukraine had not occurred, another pretext would have been found to activate the policy of “containment” towards our country. This policy has been followed religiously for many decades: only the forms and tactics by which it has been realised have changed.  It is well known that after the second world war, the confrontation between the Soviet Union and the west, headed by the US, took the form of a cold war. The military-political element of this conflict rested with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato), which was established on 4 April 1949 at the initiative of the US. An analysis of Nato’s actions shows that, having created the alliance, the US pursued two main goals. First, a military bloc formed under American leadership, aimed against the USSR. Second, Washington pre-empted the emergence in western Europe of an independent group of states that could have competed with the US. It is worth remembering that although, essentially, the US exerted unilateral control over its allies, its territory was not included in Nato’s sphere of responsibility. After the fall of the Soviet Union and the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, which united the socialist countries of Europe and whose very existence was regarded by Nato as a grave danger, the bloc was not only not dissolved, it grew further, both numerically and militarily. Nikolai Patrushev: During the cold war, a whole series of doctrines appeared in the west to justify this anti-Soviet political course. The author of one such doctrine was the American political scientist and statesman of Polish extraction, Zbigniew Brzezinski . He came up with what became known as the strategy of “weak points”, the crux of which lay in identifying the weaknesses of a potential adversary and turning them into serious problems. This strategy served to divert an opponent’s strength away from true confrontation with the US by forcing it to focus its resources on resolving its own mounting problem. In the 1970s, Brzezinski adapted this to the Soviet Union and under former president Ronald Reagan , he became America’s most important politician in relation to our country. The US national security council was in charge of implementing the strategy, with the president at the helm. The CIA was responsible for identifying and pinpointing our weak points, as well as working out how to transform them into serious problems for the USSR. It is worth remembering that the then-director of the CIA, William Casey, decided to bring in noted scholars, above all economists, but also specialists from the business world who had personal experience of fighting off competitors. In the course of extensive analytical work, the political, economic, ideological and other weak points of the USSR were defined and studied systematically. Our country’s main weak point, the CIA found, was its economy. After detailed modelling, the American specialists discovered its weakest link, namely, the chronic dependence of the USSR’s budget on the export of hydrocarbons. They came up with a strategy for bankrupting the Soviet state by pursuing two interrelated goals: slashing the USSR’s income from foreign trade at the same time as increasing its expenditure on resolving externally-provoked problems. Depressing world oil prices was seen as the main way of cutting the state’s income. This was achieved in the mid-1980s when, as a result of an agreement between the US and a range of oil-producing countries, a surplus of oil flooded onto the market and oil prices fell by a factor of four. They increased the Soviet Union’s expenditure in a number of ways: moving away from a strategy of confronting the USSR in Afghanistan towards one of entangling it in the Afghan war; inciting acts of hostility to the government in Poland and other Socialist states with the aim of goading Moscow into spending more on stabilising Eastern Europe; stepping up the arms race by, among other things, bluffing over the Strategic Defense Initiative. It must be said that the Americans achieved their aims. As a result of their actions, the USSR’s expenditure came to greatly exceed its income, provoking a deep economic crisis that spread to the spheres of politics and ideology. The Soviet leadership’s shortsighted attempts to retrieve the situation by accepting financial help from abroad gave Washington additional leverage over Moscow. “Invigorating” measures designed to liberalise the terms of foreign trade were proposed by the west and implemented by the IMF and the World Bank but, in the absence of a smooth transition from the former monopolistic system, they led to the final collapse of the economy. The strategy of weak points, American experts believe, demonstrated that an economic cold war was far more effective than a hot war and was decisive in bringing about the liquidation of the USSR and the Warsaw Pact. Nikolai Patrushev: At the end of the 20th century, fault lines opened up in the sociopolitical landscape of this region: they emerged in greatest relief during the collapse of the multinational, multi-confessional Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia. America’s leaders and those leading Nato took advantage of the fact that the military-political situation was evolving in their favour to realise their long-term aims in south-eastern Europe. In the Balkans we see particularly clearly how Russia unilaterally surrendered its assets on the world stage without being compensated at all In the 1990s, for reasons both internal and external, Russia lost the dominant influence that the Soviet Union had possessed in the Balkans and went down the route of compromise with the west. In the Balkans we see particularly clearly how Russia unilaterally surrendered its assets on the world stage without being compensated at all. The people who made our foreign policy between 1991 and 1996 had no understanding of the “national interest”. They expected gratitude for obeying their western partners and hoped to reap some special benefit for our country by cooperating closely and unconditionally with the US. In fact, our American partners stopped taking us seriously almost instantly and only gave us a condescending pat on the back from time to time. Under the cover of peacekeeping operations and encountering no serious objections from our side, Nato overstepped its mandate with ever growing confidence: it obtained the right to rent strategic infrastructure for long periods of time and, in a variety of ways, subordinated the military command of a range of countries to its control. The alliance’s units entrenched themselves firmly in the region. Other states that participated in the peacekeeping missions, Russia included, did not try to match Nato. Instead, they resigned themselves to the role of junior partners and did not wish to recognise the obvious truth that the Balkans was but a dress rehearsal and prologue for wider attempts to carve up the world. For the last 20 years, the US has acted particularly assertively and shamelessly in this area and round about. America’s ruling circles took heart from the decline and fall of the USSR and did everything in their power to gain control of Russia and central Asia’s main sources of raw materials, as well as the transit routes by which they were exported. Washington planned to extend its sphere of direct influence to the Black Sea, Caucasus and Caspian regions. All these territories were deemed to be areas of strategic national interest for the US. Russia alone hindered the implementation of America’s plans to exert total control over these deposits and transport routes because it was still capable, militarily, of inflicting unacceptable damage on the US. The resolution of this problem, American strategists believed, lay in the final destruction of our system of government and the ultimate dismemberment of our country. The first region to leave Russia ought to be the North Caucasus, they thought. Special importance was attached to Chechnya , which was clamouring for independence and had been under the de-facto control of the west for some time. In Russia, extremists and their acolytes were lent help by the British and American Secret Services, as well as their allies in Europe and the Islamic world. It was in these circumstances that the Russian leadership took a firm and principled stand to defend the integrity of the state. President Vladimir Putin revealed the strength of his political will and, by great efforts, succeeded in halting attempts to separate Chechnya from Russia. He then strengthened the republic within the Federation. After 9/11, the international community recognised that the threat from terrorism was global in scope and paramount in importance. It came to realise that combating this threat would demand a united effort. As a result of our campaign against international terrorism in the Caucasus, the west’s attacks on Russia abated somewhat and we didn’t protest about the operation of America and its allies in Afghanistan. An announcement followed that a wide anti-terrorist coalition had been formed. Washington showed some readiness to cooperate (with us) at that time but, in actual fact, they never rejected the policy of “containment” towards Russia. Nato facilities moved closer to our borders. International law was replaced by the rule of force (recall the dismemberment of first Yugoslavia, then Serbia, the occupation of Iraq and the invasion of so-called coalition forces into Afghanistan). After August 2008, when the Georgian leadership tried to annihilate South Ossetia with US help, the world changed radically once again. For the first time in many decades Washington lent direct aid to a foreign government that was attacking Russian citizens and peacekeepers. The Georgian dictator was betting on a sudden attack. Launched on the opening day of the Olympic Games, it would put Russia in a quandary, allowing the Georgians to unleash their “blitzkrieg”. But the Russian leadership reacted quickly to the deteriorating situation and took the measures necessary to halt the aggression. Nikolai Patrushev: After the events of August in the Caucasus, Washington was clearly alarmed by Russia’s readiness to take its place among the world powers of the 21 st century, to defend the principle of equal rights and absolute independence in world politics and to convert income from the exploitation of natural resources into real economic and military potential, into human capital. Future Russian cooperation with China and India was clearly not to the liking of the American leadership, nor was the reality of Brics summits, the formation of the Customs Union or the success of other organisations in which Russia plays a leading role (the Collective Security Treaty Organisation , the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and the Eurasian Economic Community ) Washington was clearly alarmed by Russia’s readiness to take its place among the world powers of the 21 st century As the world economic crisis deepened, the US attached growing importance to the rising players on the international scene, such as China, India, Brazil and Iran, as well as to the burgeoning economies of south-east Asia and South Korea. So arose new conceptual frameworks: a special partnership between American and China, strategic cooperation between the US and India, direct dialogue between Washington and Iran, and so on. The new Obama administration gave off signals about the crucial importance of restoring a mutually beneficial dialogue with Russia on a whole range of questions. The American authorities’ positive approach was to be welcomed. But it soon became clear that Washington was not interested in real cooperation. They limited themselves to mere expressions of friendship and to initiating some lines of negotiation which turned out in the end to be of almost no benefit to Russia. After a while, even these positive dialogues, non-binding as they were, came to an end and the US’s approach to our country became reminiscent of the cold war once again. Nikolai Patrushev: The coup in Kiev, which was clearly carried out with the help of the US, conformed to a classical model worked out in Latin America, Africa and the Middle East. But never before had such a coup impinged on Russia’s interests so directly. Analysis shows that by provoking Russia into retaliatory measures, the Americans are pursuing the very same goals as in the 1980s vis-a-vis the USSR. Just like back then, they are trying to define our country’s “weak points”. At the same time, of course, they are neutralising economic competitors in Europe who have grown too close to Moscow, as they see it. Analysis shows that by provoking Russia into retaliatory measures, the Americans are pursuing the very same goals as in the 1980s vis-a-vis the USSR It’s worth remembering that Washington always strived to exert leverage over Russia. In 1974, the well-known Jackson Vanik amendment was passed, limiting trade with our country. To all appearances, it became obsolete the moment the USSR fell but it nevertheless remained in force right up until 2012, when it was replaced by the so-called Magnitsky list . The current sanctions are part of the same trend. The actions of the American administration during the Ukraine crisis are part of a new current in White House foreign policy designed to preserve America’s position of leadership in the world by containing the growing power of Russia and other centres of power. What is more, Washington is actively using the possibilities that Nato offers to exert political and economic pressure on its allies and partners and thereby prevent them from wavering. Nikolai Patrushev: Specialists are convinced, in fact, that a real alternative to fossil fuels as the basis of energy production won’t appear in the next few decades. What is more, the dominant belief in the west is that the combined power generated by nuclear, hydro, wind and solar can satisfy no more than a fifth of world demand. Don’t forget another important point. In the world today, there is a growing shortage of food and drinking water for the planet’s rising population. Lacking the most basic means of survival, desperate people turn to extremism, terrorism, piracy and criminality. This accounts, in part, for the sharp disparities between countries and regions, as well as for mass migration. A shortage of water and irrigable land often causes discord, not least between the republics of Central Asia. Water represents an acute problem for a range of other countries in Asia and, especially, in Africa. Many American experts, including the former US secretary of state Madeleine Albright, claim that Moscow ended up with such vast swathes of territory that it is incapable of exploiting it all: this territory does not, therefore, “serve the interests of humanity as a whole”. We continue to hear claims that (the world’s) natural resources were divided up “unfairly” and that (Russia) must grant foreign states “free access” to them. The Americans are convinced that many other people reason in the same way, especially in the states bordering Russia, which are already banding together to support such claims on our country and will continue to do so in future. As in the case of Ukraine, they propose to solve problems at Russia’s expense and without taking its interests into account. Even during periods of relative détente between Russia/USSR and the US, such statements always held true. That is why, whatever the nuances of American behaviour, or that of its allies, this challenge will remain forever present before Russia’s leaders: to guarantee the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the homeland, to protect and multiply its wealth and to dispose of that wealth sensibly in the interests of the multinational people of the Russian Federation.

"Full Transcript of the Vice-Presidential Debate","Advertisement OCT. 11, 2012  MARTHA RADDATZ: Good evening, and welcome to the first and only vice presidential debate of 2012, sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. I’m Martha Raddatz of ABC News, and I am honored to moderate this debate between two men who have dedicated much of their lives to public service. Tonight’s debate is divided between domestic and foreign policy issues. And I’m going to move back and forth between foreign and domestic since that is what a vice president or president would have to do. We will have nine different segments. At the beginning of each segment, I will ask both candidates a question, and they will each have two minutes to answer. Then I will encourage a discussion between the candidates with follow-up questions. By coin toss, it has been determined that Vice President Biden will be first to answer the opening question. Advertisement We have a wonderful audience here at Centre College tonight. You will no doubt hear their enthusiasm at the end of the debate and right now as we welcome Vice President Biden and Congressman Paul Ryan. (Applause.) Advertisement Very nice to see you. Very nice to see you. VICE PRESIDENT JOSEPH BIDEN: How you doing? MS. RADDATZ: Hey, you got your little wave to the families in. That’s great. Good evening, gentlemen. It really is an honor to be here with both of you. I would like to begin with Libya on a rather somber note. One month ago tonight, on the anniversary of 9/11, Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other brave Americans were killed in a terrorist attack in Benghazi. The State Department has now made clear there were no protesters there. It was a pre-planned assault by heavily armed men. Wasn’t this a massive intelligence failure, Vice President Biden? VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: What it was, it was a tragedy, Martha. It -- Chris Stevens was one of our best. We lost three other brave Americans. And I can make absolutely two commitments to you and all of the American people tonight: One, we will find and bring to justice the men who did this. And secondly, we will get to the bottom of it, and whatever -- wherever the facts lead us, wherever they lead us, w will make clear to the American public, because whatever mistakes were made will not be made again. When you’re looking at a president, Martha, it seems to me that you should take a look at his most important responsibility. That’s carrying forward the national security of the country. And the best way to do that is take a look at how he’s handled he issues of the day. On Iraq, the president said he would end the war. Governor Romney said that was a tragic mistake; we should have left -- that he ended it -- Governor Romney said that was a tragic mistake; we should have left 30,000 troops there. Advertisement With regard to Afghanistan, he said he will end the war in 2014. Governor Romney said we should not set a date, number one, and number two, with regard to 2014, it depends. When it came to Osama bin Laden, the president, the first day in office -- I was sitting with him in the Oval Office. He called in the CIA and signed an order saying, my highest priority is to get bin Laden. Prior to the election, prior to the -- him being sworn in, Governor Romney was asked a question about how he would proceed. He said, I wouldn’t move heaven and earth to get bin Laden. He didn’t understand it was more than about taking a -- a murderer off the battlefield; it was about restoring America’s heart and letting terrorists around the world know if you do harm to America, we will track you to the gates of hell, if need be. And lastly, the -- the president of the United States has -- has led with a steady hand and clear vision. Governor Romney, the opposite. The last thing we need now is another war. MS. RADDATZ: Congressman Ryan. REP. RYAN: (Sighs.) We mourn the loss of these four Americans who were murdered. When you take a look at what has happened just in the last few weeks, they sent the U.N. ambassador out to say that this was because of a protest and a YouTube video. It took the president two weeks to acknowledge that this was a terrorist attack. He went to the U.N., and in his speech at the U.N. he said six times -- he talked about the YouTube video. Look, if we are hit by terrorists, we’re going to call it for what it is, a terrorist attack. Our ambassador in Paris has a Marine detachment guarding him. Shouldn’t we have a Marine detachment guarding our ambassador in Benghazi, a place where we knew that there was an al-Qaida cell with arms? This is becoming more troubling by the day. They first blamed the YouTube video; now they’re trying to blame the Romney-Ryan ticket for making this an issue. And with respect to Iraq, we had the same position before the withdrawal, which was we agreed with the Obama administration: Let’s have a Status of Forces Agreement to make sure that we secure our gains. The vice president was put in charge of those negotiations by President Obama, and they failed to get the agreement. We don’t have a Status of Forces Agreement because they failed to get one. That’s what we are talking about. And when it comes to our veterans, we owe them a great debt of gratitude for what they’ve done for us, including your son Beau. But we also want to make sure that we don’t lose the things we fought so hard to get. Advertisement And with respect to Afghanistan and the 2014 deadline, we agree with a 2014 transition. But what we also want to do is make sure that we’re not projecting weakness abroad, and that’s what’s happening here. This Benghazi issue would be a tragedy in and of itself. But unfortunately it’s indicative of a broader problem, and that is what we are watching on our TV screens is the unraveling of the Obama foreign policy, which is making the world more -- more chaotic and us less safe. MS. RADDATZ: I just want to talk to you about right in the middle of the crisis. Governor Romney -- and you’re talking about this again tonight -- talked about the weakness, talked about apologies from the Obama administration. Was that really appropriate right in the middle of the crisis? REP. RYAN: On that same day, the Obama administration had the exact same position. Let’s recall that they disavowed their own statement that they had put out earlier in the day in Cairo. So we had the same position, but we will -- it’s never to early to speak out for our values. We should have spoken out right away when the Green Revolution was up and starting, when the mullahs in Iran were attacking their people. We should not have called Bashar Assad a reformer when he was turning his Russian-provided guns on his own people. We should always stand up for peace, for democracy, for individual rights, and we should not be imposing these devastating defense cuts, because what that does when we equivocate on our values, when we show that we’re cutting our own defense -- VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Am I going to get to say anything here? REP. RYAN: -- it makes us more weak. It projects weakness, and when we look weak, our adversaries are much more willing to test us, they’re more brazen in their attacks, and our allies are less willing to -- VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: With all due respect, that’s a bunch of malarkey. In fact -- MS. RADDATZ: And why is that so? VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Because not a single thing he said is accurate. First of all -- MS. RADDATZ: Be specific. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: I will be very specific. Number one, the -- this lecture on embassy security -- the congressman here cut embassy security in his budget by $300 million below what we asked for, number one. So much for the embassy security piece. Advertisement Number two, Governor Romney, before he knew the facts, before he even knew that our ambassador was killed, he was out making a political statement which was panned by the media around the world. And this talk about this -- this weakness, I -- I don’t understand what my friend’s talking about here. We -- this is a president who’s gone out and done everything he has said he was going to do. This is the guy who’s repaired our alliances so the rest of the world follows us again. This is the guy who brought the entire world, including Russia and China, to bring about the most devastating, most devastating -- the most devastating efforts on Iran to make sure that they in fact stop with their -- look, I -- I -- I just -- I mean, these guys bet against America all the time. REP. RYAN: I -- MS. RADDATZ: Can we talk about -- let me go back to Libya. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Yeah, sure. MS. RADDATZ: What were you first told about the attack? Why were people talking about protests? When people in the consulate first saw armed men attacking with guns, there were no protesters. Why did that go on for weeks? VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Because that’s exactly what we were told -- MS. RADDATZ: By who? VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: -- by the intelligence community. The intelligence community told us that. As they learned more facts about exactly what happened, they changed their assessment. That’s why there’s also an investigation headed by Tom Pickering, a leading diplomat in the -- from the Reagan years, who is doing an investigation as to whether or not there were any lapses, what the lapses were, so that they will never happen again. But -- MS. RADDATZ: And they wanted more security there. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Well, we weren’t told they wanted more security again. We did not know they wanted more security again. And by the way, at the time we were told exactly -- we said exactly what the intelligence community told us that they knew. That was the assessment. And as the intelligence community changed their view, we made it clear they changed their view. That’s why I said, we will get to the bottom of this. You know, usually when there’s a crisis, we pull together. We pull together as a nation. But as I said, even before we knew what happened to the ambassador, the governor was holding a press conference -- was holding a press conference. That’s not presidential leadership. MS. RADDATZ: Mr. Ryan, I want to ask you about -- the Romney campaign talks a lot about no apologies. He has a book called “No Apologies.” Should the U.S. have apologized for Americans burning Qurans in Afghanistan? Should the U.S. apologize for U.S. Marines urinating on Taliban corpses? Advertisement REP. RYAN: Oh, gosh, yes. Urinating on Taliban corpses? What we should not apologize for -- MS. RADDATZ: Burning Qurans (immediately ?)? REP. RYAN: What -- what we should not be apologizing for are standing up for our values. What we should not be doing is saying to the Egyptian people, while Mubarak is cracking down on them, that he’s a good guy and then the next week say he ought to go. What we should not be doing is rejecting claims for -- calls for more security in our barracks, in our Marine -- we need Marines in Benghazi when the commander on the ground says we need more forces for security. There were requests for extra security. Those requests were not honored. Look, this was the anniversary of 9/11. It was Libya, a country we knew we had al-Qaida cells there. As we know, al-Qaida and its affiliates are on the rise in northern Africa. And we did not give our ambassador in Benghazi a Marine detachment? Of course there is an investigation so we can make sure that this never happens again. But when it comes to speaking up for our values, we should not apologize for those. Here is the problem. Look at all the various issues out there and that’s unraveling before our eyes. The vice president talks about sanctions on Iran. They got -- we’ve had four -- MS. RADDATZ: Let’s move to Iran. I’d actually like to move to Iran because there is really no bigger national security -- REP. RYAN: Absolutely. MS. RADDATZ: -- this country is facing. Both President Obama and Governor Romney have said they will prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, even if that means military action. Last week former Defense Secretary Bob Gates said a strike on Iran’s facilities would not work and, quote, could prove catastrophic, haunting us for generations. Can the two of you be absolutely clear and specific to the American people how effective would a military strike be? Congressman Ryan. REP. RYAN: We cannot allow Iran to gain a nuclear weapons capability. Now, let’s take a look at where we’ve gone -- come from. When Barack Obama was elected, they had enough fissile material, nuclear material, to make one bomb. Now they have enough for five. They’re racing toward a nuclear weapon. They’re four years closer toward a nuclear weapons capability. We’ve had four different sanctions at the U.N. on Iran, three from the Bush administration, one here. And the only reason we got it is because Russia watered it down and prevented the -- the sanctions from hitting the central bank. Mitt Romney proposed these sanctions in 2007. In Congress, I’ve been fighting for these sanctions since 2009. The administration was blocking us every step of the way. Advertisement Only because we had strong bipartisan support for these tough sanctions were we able to overrule their objections and put them in spite of the administration. Imagine what would have happened if we had these sanctions in place earlier. You think Iran’s not brazen? Look at what they’re doing. They’re stepping up their terrorist attacks. They tried a terrorist attack in the United States last year when they tried to blow up the Saudi ambassador at a restaurant in Washington, D.C. And talk about credibility. When this administration says that all options are on the table, they send out senior administration officials that send all these mixed signals. And so in order solve this peacefully, which is everybody’s goal, you have to have the ayatollahs change their minds. Look at where they are. They’re moving faster toward a nuclear weapon. It’s because this administration has no credibility on this issue. It’s because this administration watered down sanctions, delayed sanctions, tried to stop us from putting the tough sanctions in place. Now we have them in place because of Congress. They say the military option’s on the table but it’s not being viewed as credible, and the key is to do this peacefully, is to make sure that we have credibility. Under a Romney administration, we will have credibility on this issue. MS. RADDATZ: Vice President Biden. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Incredible. (Chuckles.) Look, imagine had we let the Republican Congress work out the sanctions. You think there’s any possibility the entire world would have joined us, Russia and China, all of our allies? These are the most crippling sanctions in the history of sanctions, period, period. When Governor Romney’s asked about it, he said, we got to keep these sanctions. When they said, well, you’re talking about doing more, what are you -- are you -- you’re going to go to war? Is that you want to do now? REP. RYAN: We want to prevent war! VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: (Inaudible) -- and I -- the interesting thing is, how they’re going to prevent war. How are they going to prevent war if they say that there’s nothing more that we -- that they say we should do than what we’ve already done, number one? And number two, with regard to the ability of the United States to take action militarily, it is -- it is not in my purview to talk about classified information. But we feel quite confident we could deal a serious blow to the Iranians. But number two, the Iranians are -- the Israelis and the United States -- our military and intelligence communities are absolutely the same exact place in terms of how close -- how close the Iranians are to getting a nuclear weapon. They are a good way away. There is no difference between our view and theirs. Advertisement When my friend talks about fissile material, they have to take this highly enriched uranium, get it from 20 percent up. Then they have to be able to have something to put it in. There is no weapon that the Iranians have at this point. Both the Israelis and we know we’ll know if they start the process of building a weapon. So all this bluster I keep hearing, all this loose talk -- what are they talking about? Are you talking about to be more credible? What -- what more can the president do? Stand before the United Nations, tell the whole world, directly communicate to the ayatollah: We will not let them acquire a nuclear weapon, period, unless he’s talking about going to war. REP. RYAN: Martha, let’s just -- MS. RADDATZ: Congressman Ryan. REP. RYAN: -- let’s look at this from the view of the ayatollahs. What do they see? They see this administration trying to water down sanctions in Congress for over two years. They’re moving faster toward a nuclear weapon; they’re spinning the centrifuges faster. They see us saying, when we come into the administration, when they’re sworn in, we need more space with our ally Israel. They see President Obama in New York City the same day Bibi Netanyahu is, and he’s -- instead of meeting with him goes on a -- on a daily talk show. They see -- when we say that these options are on the table, the secretary of defense walked them back. They are not changing their mind. That’s what we have to do, is change their mind so they stop pursuing nuclear weapons, and they’re going faster. MS. RADDATZ: How will you do it so quickly? Look, you both saw Benjamin Netanyahu hold up that picture of a bomb with the red line and talking about the red line being in spring. So can you solve this -- if the Romney-Ryan ticket is elected, can you solve this in two months before spring and avoid nuclear -- REP. RYAN: We -- we can debate a timeline. MS. RADDATZ: (Inaudible.) REP. RYAN: We can debate the timeline, whether there’s -- it’s that short a time or longer. I -- I agree that it’s probably longer. Number two, it’s all about credibility. MS. RADDATZ: You don’t agree with that bomb and what the Israelis -- VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: No, look -- (inaudible) -- REP. RYAN: (Inaudible) -- look, we -- we both -- (inaudible) -- MS. RADDATZ: Vice President Biden. REP. RYAN: I don’t want to go into classified stuff, but we both agree that to do this peacefully, you’ve got to get them to change their minds. They’re not changing their minds, and look at what this administration does -- MS. RADDATZ: But what do you do -- (inaudible) -- VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Let me tell you what the ayatollah sees. Advertisement REP. RYAN: You have to have credibility. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: The ayatollah sees his economy being crippled. The ayatollah sees that there are 50 percent fewer exports of oil. He sees the currency going into the tank. He sees the economy going into free fall, and he sees the world for the first time totally united in opposition to him getting a nuclear weapon. Now, with regard to Bibi, he’s been my friend for 39 years. The president has met with Bibi a dozen times. He’s spoken to Bibi Netanyahu as much as he’s spoken to anybody. The idea that we’re not -- I was in a -- just before he went to the U.N., I was in a conference call with the -- with the president, with him talking to Bibi, for well over an hour in -- in -- in -- in -- in stark relief and detail about what was going on. This is a bunch of stuff. Look, here’s the deal -- MS. RADDATZ: What does that mean, “a bunch of stuff”? VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Well, it means it’s simply inaccurate. REP. RYAN: It’s Irish. (Chuckles.) VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: It is. (Laughter.) We Irish call it malarkey. MS. RADDATZ: Thanks for the translation. OK. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: No, we Irish call it malarkey. (Laughter.) But last thing: the secretary of defense has made it absolutely clear. He didn’t walk anything back. We will not allow the Iranians to get a nuclear weapon. What Bibi held up there was when they get to the point where they can enrich uranium enough to put into a weapon, they don’t have a weapon to put it into. Let’s all calm down a little bit here. Iran is more isolated today than when we took office. It was on the ascendancy when we took office. It is totally isolated. MS. RADDATZ: Congressman Ryan -- VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: I don’t know what world you guys are in. MS. RADDATZ: Congressman Ryan -- REP. RYAN: Thank -- thank heavens we have these sanctions in place. It’s in spite of their opposition. Advertisement VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: (Chuckles.) Oh, God. REP. RYAN: They have given 20 waivers to this sanction. And all I have to point to are the results. They’re four years closer toward a nuclear weapon. I think that case speaks for itself. MS. RADDATZ: Can you tell the American people what’s worse -- VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: By the way, they’re -- no, no, they are not four years closer to a nuclear weapon. MS. RADDATZ: -- another war in the Middle East or -- VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: They’re -- they’re closer to being able to get enough fissile material to put in a weapon if they had a weapon. But -- MS. RADDATZ: You’re acting a little bit like they don’t want one, though. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Oh, I didn’t say -- no, I’m not saying -- (look ?), facts matter, Martha. You’re a foreign policy expert. Facts matter. All this loose talk about them -- all they have to do is get to -- enrich uranium in a certain amount and they have a weapon -- not true. Not true. They are more -- and if we ever have to take action, unlike where we took office, we will have the world behind us, and that matters. That matters. MS. RADDATZ: What about Bob Gates’ statement? Let me read that again: “Could prove catastrophic, haunting us for generations.” VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: He is right. It could prove catastrophic if we do -- we do it with -- (inaudible) -- MS. RADDATZ: Congressman Ryan? REP. RYAN: And what it does is it -- and it undermines our credibility by backing up the point when we make it that all options are on the table. That’s the point. The ayatollahs see these kinds of statements, and they think, I’m going to get a nuclear weapon. When -- when we see the kind of equivocation that took place because this administration wanted a precondition policy -- so when the Green Revolution started up, they were silent for nine days. When they see us putting -- when they see us putting daylight between ourselves and our allies in Israel, that gives them encouragement. When they see Russia watering down any further sanctions -- and the only reason we got a U.N. sanction is because Russia watered it down and prevented these -- (there ?) from being sanctions in the first place. So when they see this kind of activity, they are encouraged to continue, and that’s the problem. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Martha, let me tell you what Russia’s -- (inaudible) -- Advertisement MS. RADDATZ: What -- let me ask you what’s worse: war in the Middle East, another war in the Middle East, or a nuclear-armed Iran? REP. RYAN: I’ll tell you what’s worse. I’ll tell you what’s worse. MS. RADDATZ: Quickly. REP. RYAN: A nuclear-armed Iran, which triggers a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. This is the world’s largest sponsor of -- of terrorism. They’ve dedicated themselves -- VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: That’s the only thing my -- REP. RYAN: -- to wiping an entire country off the map. They call us the Great Satan. And if they get nuclear weapons, other people in the neighborhood will pursue their nuclear weapons as well. MS. RADDATZ: Vice President Biden. REP. RYAN: We can’t live with that. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: War should always be the absolute last resort. That’s why these crippling sanctions, what Bibi Netanyahu says we should continue -- which, if I’m not mistaken, Governor Romney says we -- we should continue. If I -- I may be mistaken; he changes his mind so often, I could be wrong. But the fact of the matter is, he says they’re working. And the fact is that they are being crippled by them. And we’ve made it clear, big nations can’t bluff. This president doesn’t bluff. MS. RADDATZ: Gentlemen, I want to bring the conversation to a different kind of national security issue, the state of our economy. The number one issue here at home is jobs. The percentage of unemployed just fell below 8 percent for the first time in 43 months. The Obama administration had projected that it would fall below 6 percent now after the addition of close to a trillion dollars in stimulus money. So will both of you level with the American people? Can you get unemployment to under 6 percent, and how long will it take? VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: I don’t know how long it will take. MS. RADDATZ: Vice President Biden. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: We can and we will get it under 6 percent. Let’s look at the -- let’s take a look at the facts. Let’s look at where we were when we came to office. The economy was in free fall. We had -- the Great Recession hit. Nine million people lost their job, 1.7 -- $1.6 trillion in wealth lost in equity in your homes, in retirement accounts from the middle class. We knew we had to act for the middle class. We immediately went out and rescued General Motors. We went ahead and made sure that we cut taxes for the middle class. And in addition to that, when that -- and when that occurred, what did Romney do? Romney said, no, let Detroit go bankrupt. We moved in and helped people refinance their homes. Governor Romney said, no, let foreclosures hit the bottom. Advertisement But it shouldn’t be surprising for a guy who says 47 percent of the American people are unwilling to take responsibility for their own lives. My friend recently, in a speech in Washington, said 30% of the American people are takers. These people are my mom and dad, the people I grew up with, my neighbors. They pay more effective tax than Governor Romney pays in his federal income tax. They are elderly people who in fact are living off of Social Security. They are veterans and people fighting in Afghanistan right now who are, quote, not paying any taxes. I’ve had it up to here with this notion that 47 percent -- it’s about time they take some responsibility here. And instead of signing pledges to Grover Norquist not to ask the wealthiest among us to contribute to bring back the middle class, they should be signing a pledge saying to the middle class, we’re going to level the playing field. We’re going to give you a fair shot again. We are going to not repeat the mistakes we made in the past by having a different set of rules for Wall Street and Main Street, making sure that we continue to hemorrhage these tax cuts for the superwealthy. They’re pushing the continuation of a tax cut that will give an additional $500 billion in tax cuts to 120,000 families. And they’re holding hostage the middle-class tax cut because they say, we won’t pass -- we won’t continue the middle-class tax cut unless you give the tax cut for the superwealthy. It’s about time they take some responsibility. MS. RADDATZ: Mr. Ryan. REP. RYAN: Joe and I are from similar towns. He’s from Scranton, Pennsylvania. I’m from Janesville, Wisconsin. You know what the unemployment rate in Scranton is today? VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: I sure do. REP. RYAN: It’s 10 percent. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Yeah. REP. RYAN: You know what it was the day you guys came in? VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: No. REP. RYAN: Eight-point-five percent. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Yeah. REP. RYAN: That’s how it’s going all around America. Look -- VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: You don’t read the statistics. That’s not “how it’s going.” It’s going down. MS. RADDATZ: (Inaudible) -- two-minute answer, please. REP. RYAN: Look -- (chuckles) -- did they come in and inherit a tough situation? Absolutely. Advertisement VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: (Chuckles.) REP. RYAN: But we’re going in the wrong direction! Look at where we are. The economy is barely limping along. It’s growing at 1.3 percent. That’s slower than it grew last year, and last year was slower than the year before. Job growth in September was slower than it was in August, and August was slower than it was in July. We’re heading in the wrong direction. Twenty-three million Americans are struggling for work today. Fifteen percent of Americans are living in poverty today. This is not what a real recovery looks like. We need real reforms for a real recovery, and that’s exactly what Mitt Romney and I are proposing. It’s five-point plan. Get America energy-independent in North America by the end of the decade. Help people who are hurting get the skills they need to get the jobs they want. Get this deficit and debt under control to prevent a debt crisis. Make trade work for America so we can make more things in America and sell them overseas and champion small businesses. Don’t raise taxes on small businesses, because they’re our job creators. He talks about Detroit. Mitt Romney’s a car guy. They keep misquoting him, but let me tell you about the Mitt Romney I know. This is a guy who -- I was talking to a family in Northborough, Massachusetts the other day, Cheryl and Mark Nixon (sp). Their kids were hit in a car crash, four of them -- two of them, Rob (sp) and Reid (sp), were paralyzed. The Romneys didn’t know them. They went to the same church. They never met before. Mitt asked if he could come over on Christmas. He brought his boys, his wife and gifts. Later on he said, I know you’re struggling, Mark (sp). Don’t worry about their college; I’ll pay for it. When Mark (sp) told me this story -- because you know what, Mitt Romney doesn’t tell these stories. The Nixons told this story. When he told me this story, he said it wasn’t the help -- the cash help; it’s that he gave his time, and he has consistently. This is a man who gave 30 percent of his income to charity, more than the two of us combined. Mitt Romney’s a good man. He cares about a hundred percent of Americans in this country. And with respect to that quote, I think the vice president very well knows that sometimes the words don’t come out of your mouth the right way. (Laughter.) VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: But I always say what I mean. MS. RADDATZ: You -- VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: And so does Romney. Advertisement REP. RYAN: We want everybody to succeed. We want to get people out of poverty, in the middle class, on to lives of self-sufficiency. We believe in opportunity and upward mobility. That’s what we’re going to push for in a Romney administration. MS. RADDATZ: Vice President? VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Look -- MS. RADDATZ: I have a feeling you have a few things to say here. (Laughter.) VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: (Chuckles.) The idea, if you heard that -- that little soliloquy on 47 percent, and you think he just made a mistake, then I think you’re -- I -- I -- I -- I -- I got a bridge to sell you. Look, I don’t doubt his personal generosity, and I understand what it’s like. When I was a little younger than the congressman, my wife was in an accident, killed my daughter and my wife, and my two sons survived. I have sat in the homes of many people who’ve gone through what I get through because the one thing you can give people solace is to know they know you’ve been through it, that they can make it. So I don’t doubt his personal commitment to individuals. But you know what, I know he had no commitment to the automobile industry. He just let -- he said, let it go bankrupt, period, let it drop out. All this talk -- we saved a million jobs. Two hundred thousand people are working today. And I have never met two guys who are more down on America across the board. We’re told everything is going bad. We have 5.2 million new jobs, private sector jobs. We need more, but 5.2 million -- if they’d get out of the way, if they get out of the way and let us pass the tax cut for the middle class, make it permanent, if they get out of the way and pass the -- pass the jobs bill, if they get out of the way and let us allow 14 million people who are struggling to stay in their homes because their mortgages are upside-down, but they never missed a mortgage payment -- just get out of the way. Stop talking about how you care about people. Show me something. Show me a policy. Show me a policy where you take responsibility. And by the way, they talk about this Great Recession if it fell out of the sky, like, oh my goodness, where did it come from? It came from this man voting to put two wars in a credit card, to at the same time put a prescription drug benefit on the credit card, a trillion- dollar tax cut for a -- very wealthy. I was there. I voted against him. I said, no, we can’t afford that. And now all of a sudden these guys are so seized with a concern about the debt that they created -- MS. RADDATZ: Congressman Ryan. REP. RYAN: Let’s not forget that they came in with one-party control. When Barack Obama was elected, his party controlled everything. They had the ability to do everything of their choosing, and look at where we are right now. They passed a stimulus, the idea that we could borrow $831 billion, spend it on all these special interest groups and that it would work out just fine, that unemployment would never get to 8 percent. It went up above 8 percent for 43 months. They said that right now, if we just pass this stimulus, the economy would grow at 4 percent. It’s growing at 1.3 (percent). Advertisement MS. RADDATZ: When could you get it below 6 percent? REP. RYAN: That’s what our entire premise of our pro-growth plan for a stronger middle class is all about: getting the economy growing at 4 percent, creating 12 million jobs over the next four years. Look at just the $90 billion in stimulus, and -- and the vice president was in charge of overseeing this, $90 billion in green pork to campaign contributors and special interest groups. There are just at the Department of Energy over 100 criminal investigations that have been launched into just how -- VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Martha -- REP. RYAN: -- stimulus -- (inaudible) -- are being spent -- MS. RADDATZ: Go ahead. Go ahead, Vice -- VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Martha, look. His colleague runs an investigative committee -- REP. RYAN: Crony capitalism -- (inaudible). VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: -- spent months and months and months going into this -- REP. RYAN: This is the -- this is the inspector general. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: -- months and months. They found no evidence of cronyism. And I love my friend here. I -- I’m not allowed to show letters, but go on our website: He sent me two letters saying, by the way, can you send me some stimulus money for companies here in the state of Wisconsin? We sent millions of dollars. You know why he said he needed -- MS. RADDATZ: You did ask for stimulus money, correct? VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Sure he did. By the way -- (inaudible) -- REP. RYAN: On two occasions, we -- we -- we advocated for constituents who were applying for grants. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: (Chuckles.) REP. RYAN: That’s what we do. We do that for all constituents who are -- (inaudible) -- for grants. Advertisement VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: I love that. I love that. This is such a bad program, and he writes me a letter saying -- writes the Department of Energy a letter saying, the reason we need this stimulus -- it will create growth and jobs. He -- his words. And now he’s sitting here looking at me -- and by the way, that program -- again, investigated -- what the Congress said was, it was a model: less than four-tenths of 1 percent waste or fraud in the program. And all this talk about cronyism -- they investigated, investigated; did not find one single piece of evidence. I wish he would just tell -- be a little more candid. REP. RYAN: Was it a good idea to spend taxpayer dollars on electric cars in Finland or on windmills in China? VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Look -- REP. RYAN: Was it a good idea to borrow all this money from countries like China -- VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: (Chuckles.) REP. RYAN: -- and spend it on all these various different interest groups? VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Let me tell you it was a good idea. It was a good idea -- Moody’s and others said that this was exactly what we needed that stopped us from going off the cliff. It set the conditions to be able to grow again. We have -- in fact, 4 percent of those green jobs didn’t go under -- or went -- went -- went under -- didn’t work. It’s a better batting average than investment bankers have. They have about a 40 percent -- (inaudible) -- loss. REP. RYAN: Where are the 5 million green jobs that were being promised -- MS. RADDATZ: I want to move on here to Medicare and entitlements. I think we’ve gone over this quite enough. And both -- VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: And by the way, any letter you send me I’ll entertain. REP. RYAN: I appreciate that, Joe. (Laughter.) MS. RADDATZ: Let’s talk about Medicare and entitlements. Both Medicare and Social Security are going broke and taking a larger share of the budget in the process. Will benefits for Americans under these programs have to change for the programs to survive, Mr. Ryan? REP. RYAN: Absolutely. Medicare and Social Security are going bankrupt. These are indisputable facts. Look, when I look at these programs, we’ve all had tragedies in our lives. I think about what they’ve done for my own family. My mom and I had my grandmother move in with us who was facing Alzheimer’s. Medicare was there for her, just like it’s there for my mom right now who’s a Florida senior. After my dad died, my mom and I got Social Security survivors benefits. Helped me pay for college. It helped her go back to college in her 50s, where she started a small business because of the new skills she got. She paid all of her taxes on the promise that these programs would be there for her. We will honor this promise. And the best way to do it is reform it for my generation. You see, if you reform these programs for my generation, people 54 and below, you can guarantee they don’t change for people in or near retirement, which is precisely what Mitt Romney and I are proposing. Look at what -- look what “Obamacare” does. “Obamacare” takes $716 billion from Medicare to spend on “Obamacare.” Even their own chief actuary at Medicare backs this up. He says you can’t spend the same dollar twice. You can’t claim that this money goes to Medicare and “Obamacare.” And then they put this new “Obamacare” board in charge of cutting Medicare each and every year in ways that will lead to denied care for current seniors. This board, by the way, it’s 15 people. The president’s supposed to appoint them next year. And not one of them even has to have medical training. And Social Security, if we don’t shore up Social Security, when we run out of the IOUs, when the program goes bankrupt, a 25 percent across-the-board benefit cut kicks in on current seniors in the middle of their retirement. We’re going to stop that from happening. They haven’t put a credible solution on the table. He’ll tell you about vouchers. He’ll say all these things to try and scare people. Here’s what we’re saying: Give younger people, when they become Medicare-eligible, guaranteed coverage options that you can’t be denied, including traditional Medicare. Choose your plan, and then Medicare subsidizes your premiums, not as much for the wealthy people, more coverage for middle-income people and total out-of-pocket coverage for the poor and the sick. Choice and competition -- we would rather have 50 million future seniors determine how their Medicare is delivered to them instead of 15 bureaucrats deciding what -- if, where, when they get it. MS. RADDATZ: Vice President Biden, two minutes. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: You know, I heard that death panel argument from Sarah Palin. It seems that every vice presidential debate, I hear this kind of stuff about panels. But let’s talk about Medicare. What we did is we saved $716 billion and put it back -- applied it to Medicare. We cut the cost of Medicare. We stopped overpaying insurance companies when doctors and hospitals -- the AMA supported what we did. AARP endorsed what we did. And it extends the life of Medicare to 2024. They want to wipe this all out. It also gave more benefits. Any senior out there, ask yourself: Do you have more benefits today? You do. If you’re near the doughnut hole, you have $600 more to help your prescription drug costs. You get wellness visits without copays. They wipe all of this out, and Medicare goes -- becomes insolvent in 2016, number one. Number two, guaranteed benefit -- it’s a voucher. When they first proposed -- when the congressman had his first voucher program, the CBO said it would cost $6,400 a year, Martha, more for every senior 55 and below when they got there. He knew that, yet he got it -- all the guys in Congress, and women in the Republican party to vote for it. Governor Romney, knowing that, said, I -- I -- I would sign it were I there. Who you believe, the AMA? Me? A guy who’s fought his whole life for this? Or somebody who had actually put in motion a plan that knowingly cut -- added $6,400 a year more to the cost of Medicare? Now they got a new plan. Trust me, it’s not going to cost you any more. Folks, follow your instincts on this one. And with regard to Social Security, we will not -- we will not privatize it. If we had listened to Romney, to Governor Romney and the congressman during the Bush years, imagine where all those seniors would be now if their money had been in the market. Their ideas are old, and their ideas are bad, and they eliminate the guarantee of Medicare. REP. RYAN: Here’s the problem. They got caught with their hands in the cookie jar turning Medicare into a piggy bank for “Obamacare”. Their own actuary from the administration came to Congress and said one out of six hospitals and nursing homes are going to go out of business as a result of this. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: That’s not what they said. REP. RYAN: Seven point four million seniors are projected to lose the current Medicare Advantage coverage they have. That’s a $3,200 benefit cut. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: That didn’t happen. REP. RYAN: What we’re saying -- VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: More people signed up. REP. RYAN: These are from your own actuaries. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: More -- more -- more people signed up for Medicare Advantage after the change. REP. RYAN: What -- what they’re -- VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: No -- nobody is getting shut down. REP. RYAN: Mr. Vice President, I know -- VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: No -- no -- (inaudible) -- REP. RYAN: Mr. Vice President, I know you’re under a lot of duress -- (laughter) -- to make up for lost ground -- (laughter) -- but I think people would be better served if we don’t keep interrupting each other. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Well, don’t take all the four minutes, then. REP. RYAN: Now let me just -- let me say this. We are not -- we are saying, don’t change benefits for people 55 and above. They already organized their retirement around these promises. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: They already are -- REP. RYAN: But you want to -- (inaudible) -- these programs for those of us -- MS. RADDATZ: Let me ask you this: what is your specific plan for seniors who really can’t afford to make up the difference in the value of what you call a premium support plan and others call a voucher? REP. RYAN: A hundred percent coverage for them. MS. RADDATZ: And what -- REP. RYAN: That’s what we’re saying. MS. RADDATZ: -- what cost -- REP. RYAN: So we’re saying income-adjust -- MS. RADDATZ: How do you make that up? REP. RYAN: -- these premium support payments by taking down the subsidies for wealthy people. Look, this is a plan -- by the way, that $6,400 number, it was misleading then. It’s totally inaccurate now. This is a plan that’s bipartisan. It’s a plan I put together with a prominent Democrat senator from Oregon. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: There’s not one Democrat who endorsed his -- REP. RYAN: It’s a plan -- VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: -- not one Democrat who signed his plan. REP. RYAN: Our partner is a Democrat from Oregon. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: And he said he does no longer support (you for that ?). REP. RYAN: We -- we put it -- we put it together with the former Clinton budget director. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Who disavows it. (Chuckles.) REP. RYAN: This idea -- this idea came from the Clinton commission to save Medicare, chaired by Senator John Breaux. Here’s the point, Martha. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Which was rejected. REP. RYAN: If we don’t -- if we don’t fix this problem pretty soon, then current seniors get cut! Here’s the problem. Ten thousand people are retiring every single day in America today, and they will for 20 years. That’s not a political thing. That’s a math thing. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Martha, if we just did one thing, if we just -- if they allow Medicare to bargain for the cost of drugs like Medicaid can, that would save $156 billion right off the bat. REP. RYAN: And it would deny seniors choices. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: All -- all -- all -- REP. RYAN: It -- it has restricted (formula ?) -- VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Seniors are not denied. REP. RYAN: Absolutely. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Sorry, they are not denied. Look, folks, and all you seniors out there, have you been denied choices? Have you lost Medicare Advantage or, if you have signed up -- REP. RYAN: Because it’s working well right now. VICE RESIDENT BIDEN: Because we changed the law! MS. RADDATZ: Vice President Biden, let me ask you, if it could help solve the problem, why not very slowly raise the Medicare eligibility age by two years, as Congressman Ryan suggests? VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Look, I was there when we did that with Social Security, in 1983. I was one of eight people sitting in the room that included Tip O’Neill negotiating with President Reagan. We all got together, and everybody said, as long as everybody’s in the deal, everybody’s in the deal, and everybody is making some sacrifice, we can find a way. We made the system solvent to 2033. We will not, though, be part of any voucher plan eliminating -- the voucher says, Mom, when you’re -- when you’re 65, go out there, shop for the best insurance you can get; you’re out of Medicare. You can buy back in, if you want, with this voucher, which will not keep pace -- will not keep pace with health care costs, because if it did keep pace with health care costs, there would be no savings. That’s why they go the voucher -- they -- we will be no part of a voucher program or the privatization of Social Security. REP. RYAN: A voucher is you go to your mailbox, get a check and buy something. Nobody’s proposing that. Barack Obama, four years ago, running for president, said if you don’t have any fresh ideas, use stale tactics to scare voters. If you don’t have a good record to run on, paint your opponent as someone people should run from. Make a big election about small ideas. MS. RADDATZ: You were one of the few lawmakers to stand with President Bush when he was seeking to partially privatize Social Security. REP. RYAN: For younger people. What we said then and what I’ve always agreed is let younger Americans have a voluntary choice of making their money work faster for them within the Social Security system. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: You saw how well that worked. REP. RYAN: That’s not what Mitt Romney’s proposing. What we’re saying is no changes for anybody 55 and above. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: What Mitt Romney is proposing -- REP. RYAN: And then the kinds of the changes we’re talking about for younger people like myself is don’t increase the benefits for wealthy people as fast as everybody else -- VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Martha -- REP. RYAN: -- slowly raise the retirement age over time. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Martha -- REP. RYAN: It wouldn’t get to the age of 70 until the year 2103, according to the actuaries. Now, here’s the issue. MS. RADDATZ: Quickly, Vice President. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Quickly, the bottom line here is that all the studies show that if we went with Social Security proposal made by Mitt Romney, if you’re 40 -- in your 40s now, you will pay $2,600 a year -- you get $2,600 a year less in Social Security. If you’re in your 20s now, you get $4,700 a year less. The idea of changing -- and change being, in this case, to cut the benefits for people without taking other action you could do to make it work -- is absolutely the wrong way. These -- look, these guys haven’t been big on Medicare from the beginning. Their party’s not been big on Medicare from the beginning. And they’ve always been about Social Security as little as you can do. Look, folks, use your common sense. Who do you trust on this? A man who introduced a bill that would raise it $6,400 a year, knowing it and passing it, and Romney saying he’d sign it? Or me and the president? REP. RYAN: That statistic was completely misleading. But more importantly -- VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: That’s -- there are the facts, right? REP. RYAN: -- this is -- this is what politicians do when they don’t have a record to run on: try to scare people from voting for you. If you don’t get ahead of this problem, it’s going to -- (inaudible) -- VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Medicare beneficiaries have more benefits now -- (inaudible) -- REP. RYAN: We are not going to run away -- we are not going to run away -- MS. RADDATZ: OK. We’re going to -- we’re going to move on to a very simple question to you both. REP. RYAN: Medicare and Social Security did so much for my own family. We are not going to jeopardize this program, but we have to save it for the next generation so it doesn’t go bankrupt. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: You are jeopardizing the program. You’re changing the program from a guaranteed benefit to a premium support. Whatever you call it, the bottom line is people are going to have to pay more money out of their pocket. REP. RYAN: The wealthy would. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: And the families I know and the families I come from -- they don’t have the money to pay more out of -- (inaudible). MS. RADDATZ: Gentlemen, gentlemen -- REP. RYAN: That’s why we’re saying more for lower-income people and less for higher-income people. MS. RADDATZ: I would like to move on to a very simple question for both of you. And something tells me -- VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: (Chuckles.) MS. RADDATZ: -- I won’t get a very simple answer. But let me ask you this. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: I gave you a simple answer: He’s raising the cost of Medicare. MS. RADDATZ: OK, on to taxes. If your ticket is elected, who will pay more in taxes? Who will pay less? And we’re starting with Vice President Biden for two minutes. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: The middle class will pay less, and people making a million dollars or more will begin to contribute slightly more. Let me give you one concrete example: the continuation of the Bush tax cuts. We’re arguing that the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy should be allowed to expire. Of the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy, 800 million -- billion dollars of that goes to people making a minimum of a million dollars. We see no justification in these economic times for those -- and they’re patriotic Americans. They’re -- they’re not asking for this continued tax cut; they’re not suggesting it; but my friends are insisting on it. A hundred and twenty thousand families, by continuing that tax cut, will get an additional $500 billion in tax relief in the next 10 years, and their income is an average of $8 million. We want to extend permanently the middle-class tax cut for -- permanently from the Bush middle-class tax cut. These guys won’t allow us to. You what we’re saying? We say let’s have a vote. Let’s have a vote on the middle-class tax cut, and let’s have a vote on the upper tax cut. Let’s go ahead and vote on it. They’re saying no. They’re holding hostage the middle-class tax cut to the super wealthy. And on top of that, they got another tax cut coming that’s $5 trillion that all of the studies point out will, in fact, give another $250 million dollar -- yeah, $250,000 a year to those 120,000 families and raise taxes for people who are middle-income with a child by $2,000 a year. This is unconscionable. There is no need for this. The middle class got knocked on their heels. The Great Recession crushed them. They need some help now. The last people who need help are 120,000 families for another -- another $500 billion tax cut over the next 10 years. MS. RADDATZ: Congressman. REP. RYAN: Our entire premise of these tax reform plans is to grow the economy and create jobs. It’s a plan that’s estimated to create 7 million jobs. Now, we think that government taking 28 percent of a family and business’ income is enough. President Obama thinks that the government ought to be able to take as much as 44.8 percent of a small business’ income. Look, if you taxed every person in successful small business making over $250,000 at a hundred percent, it’d only run the government for 98 days. If everybody who paid income taxes last year, including successful small businesses, doubled their income taxes this year, we’d still have a $300 billion deficit. You see, there aren’t enough rich people and small businesses to tax to pay for all their spending. And so the next time you hear them say, don’t worry about it, we’ll get a few wealthy people to pay their fair share, watch out, middle class. The tax bill is coming to you. That’s why we’re saying we need fundamental tax reform. Let’s take a look at it this way: 8-out-of-10 businesses, they file their taxes as individuals, not as corporations. And where I come from, overseas, which is Lake Superior -- (chuckles) -- the Canadians -- they drop their tax rates to 15 percent. The average tax rate on businesses in the industrialized world is 25 percent, and the president wants the top effective tax rate on successful small businesses to go above 40 percent. Two-thirds of our jobs come from small businesses. This one tax would actually tax about 53 percent of small-business income. It’s expected that’d cost us 710,000 jobs. And you know what? It doesn’t even pay for 10 percent of their proposed deficit spending increases. What we are saying is lower tax rates across the board and close loopholes, primarily to the higher-income people. We have three bottom lines: Don’t raise the deficit, don’t raise taxes on the middle class and don’t lower the share of income that is borne by the high-income earners. He -- he’ll keep saying this $5 trillion plan, I suppose -- VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: (Chuckles.) REP. RYAN: -- it’s been discredited by six other studies, and even their own deputy campaign manager acknowledged that it wasn’t correct. MS. RADDATZ: Well, let’s talk about this 20 percent. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Well -- (chuckles) -- MS. RADDATZ: You have refused yet again to offer specifics on how you pay for that 20 percent across-the-board tax cut. Do you actually have the specifics, or are you still working on it, and that’s why you won’t tell voters? REP. RYAN: Different than this administration, we actually want to have big bipartisan agreements. You see, I understand the -- MS. RADDATZ: Do you have the specifics? Do you have the math? Do you know exactly what you’re doing? VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: That’ll be -- that’d be a first for the Republican Congress. REP. RYAN: Look -- look at what Mitt -- look at what Ronald Reagan and Tip O’Neill did. They worked together out of a framework to lower tax rates and broaden the base, and they worked together to fix that. What we’re saying is here’s our framework: Lower tax rates 20 percent -- we raise about $1.2 trillion through income taxes. We forgo about 1.1 trillion (dollars) in loopholes and deductions. And so what we’re saying is deny those loopholes and deductions to higher- income taxpayers so that more of their income is taxed, which has a broader base of taxation -- Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter. You must select a newsletter to subscribe to. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Can I translate? REP. RYAN: -- so we can lower tax rates across the board. Now, here’s why I’m saying this. What we’re saying is here’s a framework -- VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: I hope I’m going to get time to respond to this. REP. RYAN: We want to work with Congress -- MS. RADDATZ: I -- you’ll get time. REP. RYAN: We want to work with Congress on how best to achieve this. That means successful -- look -- MS. RADDATZ: No specifics, yeah. REP. RYAN: Mitt -- what we’re saying is -- (laughter) -- lower tax rates 20 percent, start with the wealthy, work with Congress to do it -- MS. RADDATZ: And you guarantee this math will add up. REP. RYAN: Absolutely. Six studies have guaranteed -- six studies have verified that this math adds up, but here’s the other point -- MS. RADDATZ: Vice President Biden -- VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Look -- REP. RYAN: (Inaudible) -- one point -- (inaudible) -- MS. RADDATZ: Vice President Biden. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Let me translate. Let me have a chance to translate. REP. RYAN: I’ll come back in a second then, right? VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: First of all, I was there when Ronald Reagan tax breaks -- I mean, he gave specifics of what he was going to cut, no -- number one, in terms of tax expenditures. Number two, 97 percent of the small businesses of America pay less -- make less than $250,000. Let me tell you who some of those other small businesses are: hedge funds that make 6(00 million dollars), $800 million a year. That -- that’s what they count as small business because they’re passthrough. Let’s look at how sincere they are. Ronald -- I mean, excuse me, Governor Romney, on “60 Minutes,” I guess it’s about 10 days ago, was asked, Governor, you pay 14 percent on $20 million. Someone making $50,000 pays more than that. Do you think that’s fair? He said, oh, yes, that’s fair; that’s fair. This is -- and they’re going to talk -- I mean, you think these guys are going to go out there and cut those loopholes? The loophole -- the biggest loophole they take advantage of is the carried interest loophole and -- and capital gains loophole. They exempt that. Now, there’s not enough -- the reason why the AEI study, the American Enterprise Institute study, the Tax Policy Center study, the reason they all say it’s going to -- taxes will go up on the middle class, the only way you can find $5 trillion in loopholes is cut the mortgage deduction for middle-class people, cut the health care deduction for middle-class people, take away their ability to get a tax break to send their kids to college. That’s why they -- (inaudible) -- MS. RADDATZ: Is he wrong about that? REP. RYAN: He is wrong about that. There are -- you can -- VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: How’s that? REP. RYAN: You can cut tax rates by 20 percent and still preserve these important preferences for middle-class taxpayers -- VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Not mathematically possible. REP. RYAN: It is mathematically possible. It’s been done before. It’s precisely what we’re proposing. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: (Chuckles.) It has never been done before. REP. RYAN: It’s been done a couple of times, actually. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: It has never been done before. REP. RYAN: Jack Kennedy lowered tax rates, increased growth. Ronald Reagan -- VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Oh, now you’re Jack Kennedy. REP. RYAN: Ronald Reagan -- (laughter) -- (chuckles) -- Republicans and Democrats -- VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: This is amazing. REP. RYAN: Republicans and Democrats have worked together on this. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: That’s right. REP. RYAN: I understand aren’t used to doing bipartisan deals. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: But we told each other what we were going to do. When we did with Reagan, he said -- REP. RYAN: Republicans and Democrats -- VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: -- here -- here are the things we’re going to cut. This is what he said. REP. RYAN: We can agree on a framework; let’s work together to fill in the details. That’s exactly -- VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Fill in the details. REP. RYAN: That’s how you get things done. You work with Congress -- VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: (Seriously ?). REP. RYAN: Look, let me say it this way. Mitt Romney was governor -- VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: That’s coming from the Republican Congress working bipartisanly? REP. RYAN: Mitt -- Mitt Romney -- VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Seven percent rating? Come on. REP. RYAN: Mitt Romney was governor of Massachusetts, where 87 percent of the legislators he served with were Democrats. He didn’t demonize them. He didn’t demagogue them. He met with those party leaders every week. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: (Chuckles.) REP. RYAN: He reached across the aisle. He didn’t compromise principles. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: And you (saw what happened ?). REP. RYAN: He found common ground, and he balanced the budget. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: (You saw what ?) -- if he did such a great job -- if he did such a great job in Massachusetts -- MS. RADDATZ: Vice President, what -- REP. RYAN: He balanced the budget four times. He balanced the budget four times without raising taxes. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: -- why isn’t he even contesting Massachusetts? REP. RYAN: (Inaudible.) MS. RADDATZ: Vice President, what would you suggest -- what would you suggest beyond raising taxes on the wealthy that would substantially reduce the long-term deficit? VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Not -- just let the taxes expire like they’re supposed to on those millionaires. We don’t -- we can’t afford $800 billion going to people making a minimum a million dollars. They do not need it, Martha. Those 120,000 families make $8 million a year. Middle-class people need the help. Why does my friend cut out the tuition tax credit for them? Why does he go out after the child -- (inaudible)? MS. RADDATZ: Can you declare anything off-limits -- VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Why do they do that? MS. RADDATZ: Can you declare anything off limits? Home mortgages deductions -- REP. RYAN: Yeah. We’re saying close loopholes on high-interest people-- MS. RADDATZ: Home mortgage deductions -- REP. RYAN: -- for higher-income people. Here -- VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Can you guarantee that no one -- REP. RYAN: This taxes -- VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: -- making less than $100,000 will have a mortgage -- REP. RYAN: This -- VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: -- their mortgage deduction impacted? Guarantee? REP. RYAN: This taxes a million small businesses. He keeps trying to make you think that it’s just some movie star or hedge fund guy or an actor-- VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Ninety-seven percent of the small businesses make less than $250,000 a year -- REP. RYAN: Joe -- VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: -- would not be affected. REP. RYAN: -- you know, it hits a million -- this taxes a million people, a million small businesses -- VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Doesn’t tax 97 percent of the American businesses -- small businesses -- REP. RYAN: It -- it taxes a million small businesses, who are our great job creators. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: I wish I’d get it -- the greatest job creators are the hedge fund guys. REP. RYAN: (Let’s end ?) -- MS. RADDATZ: And you’re going -- and you’re going to increase the defense budget. REP. RYAN: Think about it this way. MS. RADDATZ: And you’re going to increase the defense budget. REP. RYAN: No, we’re just not going to cut the defense budget like they’re -- they’re proposing -- VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: They’re going to increase it $2 billion -- $2 trillion. REP. RYAN: That’s not accurate. We’re talking about preventing -- MS. RADDATZ: More than that. No -- so no massive defense increase? REP. RYAN: No, we’re saying is, don’t -- OK, you want to get into defense now? MS. RADDATZ: Let -- yes, I do. I do -- REP. RYAN: All right. So -- MS. RADDATZ: -- because that’s another math question. REP. RYAN: Right. OK. MS. RADDATZ: How do you do that? REP. RYAN: So they proposed a $478 (sic) billion cut to defense to begin with. Now we have another $500 billion cut to defense that’s lurking on the horizon. They insisted upon that cut being involved in the debt negotiations -- MS. RADDATZ: Let -- REP. RYAN: -- and now we have a $1 trillion cut -- MS. RADDATZ: Let’s put the automatic defense cuts aside. OK? REP. RYAN: Right. OK. MS. RADDATZ: Let’s put those aside. No one wants that. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: I’d like to go back to that. REP. RYAN: OK. MS. RADDATZ: But I want to know how you do the math and have this increase in defense spending? VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Two trillion dollars. REP. RYAN: You don’t cut defense by a trillion dollars. That’s what we’re talking about. The additional trillion -- MS. RADDATZ: And what national security issues justify an increase? VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Who’s cutting it by a trillion? REP. RYAN: We’re going to cut 80,000 soldiers, 20,000 Marines, 120 cargo planes. We’re going to push the Joint Strike Fighter out. MS. RADDATZ: Drawing down in one war -- REP. RYAN: We’re cutting missile defense. MS. RADDATZ: -- and one war -- (inaudible ) -- REP. RYAN: If these cuts go through, our Navy will be the small it is -- it -- the smallest it has been since before World War I. This invites weakness. Look, do we believe in peace through strength? You bet we do. And that means you don’t impose these devastating cuts on our military. So we’re saying don’t cut the military by a trillion dollars, not increase it by a trillion, don’t cut it by a trillion dollars. MS. RADDATZ: Quickly, Vice President Biden, on this, and I want to move on. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Look, we don’t cut it. And I might add this so-called -- I know we don’t want to use the fancy word “sequester,” this automatic cut -- that was part of a debt deal that they asked for. And let me tell you what my friend said at a press conference announcing his support of the deal. He said -- and I’m -- we’ve been looking for this moment for a long time. (Inaudible) -- REP. RYAN: Can I tell you what that meant? VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Why -- REP. RYAN: We’ve been looking for bipartisanship for a long time. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: And so the bipartisanship is what he voted for: the automatic cuts in defense if they didn’t act. And beyond that, they asked for another -- look, the military says, we need a smaller, leaner Army. We need more special forces. We need -- we don’t need more M1 tanks. What we need is more UADs. MS. RADDATZ: Some of the military -- I know that’s -- (inaudible) -- VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Not some of the military; that was the decision of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, recommended to us and agreed to by the president. That’s a fact. MS. RADDATZ: Who answers to the civilian leaders. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: They made the recommendation first. MS. RADDATZ: OK. Let’s move on to Afghanistan. REP. RYAN: Can I get into that for a second? MS. RADDATZ: I’d like to move on to Afghanistan, please. REP. RYAN: OK. MS. RADDATZ: And that’s one of the biggest expenditures this country has made, in dollars and, more importantly, in lives. We just passed the sad milestone of losing 2,000 U.S. troops there in this war. More than 50 of them were killed this year by the very Afghan forces we are trying to help. Now, we’ve reached the recruiting goal for Afghan forces. We’ve degraded al-Qaida. So tell me, why not leave now? What more can we really accomplish? Is it worth more American lives? REP. RYAN: We don’t want to lose the gains we’ve gotten. We want to make sure that the Taliban does not come back in and give al- Qaida a safe haven. We agree with the administration on their 2014 transition. Look, when I think about Afghanistan, I think about the incredible job that our troops have done. You’ve been there more than the two of us combined. First time I was there in 2002, it was amazing to me what they were facing. When I went to the Arghandab Valley in Kandahar before the surge, I sat down with a young private in the 82nd from the Menominee Indian Reservation who would tell me what he did every day, and I was in awe. And to see what they had in front of them -- and then to go back there in December, to go throughout Helmand with the Marines to see what they had accomplished -- it’s nothing short of amazing. What we don’t want to do is lose the gains we’ve gotten. Now, we’ve disagreed from time to time on a few issues. We would have more likely taken into account the recommendations from our commanders, General Petraeus, Admiral Mullen, on troop levels throughout this year’s fighting season. We’ve been skeptical about negotiations with the Taliban, especially while they’re shooting at us. But we want to see the 2014 transition be successful. And that means we want to make sure our commanders have what they need to make sure that it is successful so that this does not once again become a launching pad for terrorists. MS. RADDATZ: Vice President Biden. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Martha, let’s keep our eye on the ball. The reason I’ve been in and out of Afghanistan and Iraq 20 times -- I’ve been up in the Kunar -- I’ve been throughout that whole country, mostly in a helicopter and sometimes in a vehicle. The fact is we went there for one reason: to get those people who killed Americans, al-Qaida. We’ve decimated al-Qaida central. We have eliminated Osama bin Laden. That was our purpose. And in fact, in the meantime, what we said we would do, we would help train the Afghan military. It’s their responsibility to take over their own security. That’s why, with 49 of our allies in Afghanistan, we’ve agreed on a gradual drawdown so we’re out of there by the year -- in the year 2014. My friend and the governor say it’s based on conditions, which means it depends. It does not depend for us. It is the responsibility of the Afghans to take care of their own security. We have trained over 315,000, mostly without incident. There have been more than two dozen cases of green on blue where Americans have been killed. If we do -- if the -- if the measures the military has taken do not take hold, we will not go on joint patrols, we will not train in the field. We’ll only train in the -- in the Army bases that exist there. But we are leaving. We are leaving in 2014, period, and in the process, we’re going to be saving over the next 10 years another $800 billion. We’ve been in this war for over a decade. The primary objective is almost completed. Now all we’re doing is putting the Kabul government in a position to be able to maintain their own security. It’s their responsibility, not America’s. MS. RADDATZ: What conditions could justify staying, Congressman Ryan? REP. RYAN: We don’t want to stay. We want -- look, one of my best friends in Janesville, a reservist, is at a forward operating base in Eastern Afghanistan right now. Our wives are best friends, our daughters are best friends. I want -- I want him and all of our troops to come home as soon and safely as possible. We want to make sure that 2014 is successful. That’s why we want to make sure that we give our commanders what they say they need to make it successful. We don’t want to extend beyond 2014. That’s the point we’re making. You know, if it was just this, I feel like we would -- we would be able to call this a success, but it’s not. What we are witnessing as we turn on our television screens these days, is the absolute unraveling of the Obama foreign policy. Problems are growing at home, but jobs -- problems are growing abroad, but jobs aren’t growing here at home. MS. RADDATZ: Let me go back to this. He says we’re absolutely leaving in 2014. You’re saying that’s not an absolute, but you won’t talk about what conditions would justify -- REP. RYAN: Do you know why we say that? Do you know why we say that? VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: I’d like to know why. REP. RYAN: Because we don’t want to broadcast to our enemies, put a date on your calendar, wait us out and then come back. We want to make sure -- MS. RADDATZ: But you agree with the timeline? REP. RYAN: We do -- we do agree with the timeline in the transition, but what we -- what any administration will do in 2013 is assess the situation to see how best to complete this timeline. What we do not want to do -- VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: We will leave in 2014. REP. RYAN: What we do not want to do is give our allies reason to trust us less and our enemies more -- we don’t want to embolden our enemies to hold and wait out for us and then take over the -- VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Martha, that’s a bizarre statement. REP. RYAN: That’s why we want to make sure -- no, that’s why we want to make sure that this -- that -- VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: That’s a bizarre statement, since 49 of our allies -- hear me, 49 of our allies signed onto this position, 49. REP. RYAN: And we’re reading that they want to pull out early. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Forty-nine. Forty-nine of our allies said out in 2014. It’s the responsibility of the Afghans. We have other responsibilities -- REP. RYAN: Which is -- which is -- which is what we agree with. MS. RADDATZ: Do you -- do you think that this timeline -- but we have -- we have soldiers and Marines -- VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: (Theirs are sufficient. ?) MS. RADDATZ: We have Afghan forces murdering our forces over there. The Taliban is, do you think, taking advantage of this timeline? VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Well, look, the Taliban -- what we’ve found out -- and we -- you -- you saw it in Iraq, Martha. Unless you set a timeline, Baghdad in the case of Iraq and -- and Kabul in the case of Afghanistan will not step up. They’re happy to let us continue to do the job -- international security forces to do the job. The only way they step up is say, fellas, we’re leaving; we’ve trained you; step up. Step up. MS. RADDATZ: But let me -- let me go back -- VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: That’s the only way it works. MS. RADDATZ: Let me go back to the surge troops that we put in there. And you brought this up, Congressman Ryan. I have talked to a lot of troops. I’ve talked to senior officers who were concerned that the surge troops were pulled out during the fighting season, and some of them saw that as a political -- as a political move. So can you tell me, Vice President Biden, what was the military reason for bringing those surge troops home before the fighting season ended? VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: The military reason was bringing -- by the way, when the president announced the surge -- you’ll remember, Martha -- he said, the surge will be out by the end of the summer. The military said, the surge will be out. Nothing political about this. Before the surge occurred -- so you be a little straight with me here, too -- before the surge occurred, we said, they’ll be out by the end of the summer. That’s what the military said. The reason for that is -- MS. RADDATZ: Military follows orders. They -- I mean, there -- trust me, there are people -- VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Sure -- MS. RADDATZ: -- who were concerned about pulling out on the fighting season. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: But -- there are people that were concerned, but not the Joint Chiefs. That was their recommendation in the Oval Office to the president of the United States of America. I sat there. I’m sure you’ll find someone who disagrees with the Pentagon. I’m positive you’ll find that within the military. But that’s not the case here. And secondly, the reason why the military said that is you cannot wait and have a cliff. It takes, you know, months and months and months to draw down forces. (Inaudible) -- cannot wait -- REP. RYAN: Let me bring some -- let me try and illustrate the issue here, because I think this -- it can get a little confusing. We’ve all met with General Allen and General Scaparotti in Afghanistan to talk about fighting seasons. Here’s the way it works. The mountain passes fill in with snow. The Taliban and the terrorists and the Haqqani and the Quetta shura come over from Pakistan to fight our men and women. When it fills in with snow, they can’t do it. That’s what we call fighting seasons. In the warm months fighting gets really high; in the winter it goes down. And so when Admiral Mullen and General Petraeus came to Congress and said, if you pull these people out before the fighting season is end, it puts people more at risk -- that’s the problem. Yes, we drew 22,000 troops down last month. But the remaining troops that are there, who still have the same mission to prosecute, counterinsurgency, are doing it with fewer people. That makes them less safe. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: (Inaudible.) REP. RYAN: We’re sending fewer people out in all these hot spots to do the same job that they were supposed to do a month ago -- VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Because we turned it over -- REP. RYAN: -- but we took 22,000 people out for them to do it. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: -- we turned it over to the Afghan troops we trained. No one got pulled out that didn’t get filled in by trained Afghan personnel. And he’s -- he’s -- he’s conflating two issues. The fighting season that Petraeus was talking about and former -- and Admiral Mullen was the fighting season this spring. That’s what he was talking about. We did not -- we did not pull them out. REP. RYAN: The calendar works the same every year. (Chuckles.) VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: It does work the same every year. (Inaudible) -- there -- REP. RYAN: (Chuckles.) Spring, summer, fall -- (chuckles) -- it’s warm or it’s not. They’re still fighting us, they’re still coming over the passes, they’ll -- they’re still coming in to Zabul or to Kunar, to all of these areas, but we are sending fewer people to the front to fight them. And that is not safe. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: That’s right, because that’s the Afghan responsibility. We’ve trained them. REP. RYAN: Not in the East. MS. RADDATZ: Let’s move -- let’s move to another war. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Not in the East? (Inaudible) -- REP. RYAN: (Inaudible) -- East, RC-East -- VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: RC-East, most dangerous place in the world. REP. RYAN: That’s why -- that’s why we don’t want to send fewer people to do the job. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: That’s -- that’s why we should send Americans in to do the job instead of the -- you’d rather Americans be going in and doing the job instead of -- (inaudible) -- REP. RYAN: No. We are already sending Americans to do the job -- VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: No -- REP. RYAN: -- but fewer of them. That’s the whole point. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: That -- that’s right. We’re sending in more Afghans to do the job, Afghans to do the job. MS. RADDATZ: Let’s move to another war, the civil war in Syria, where there are estimates that -- estimates that more than 25,000, 30,000 people have now been killed. In March of last year, President Obama explained the military action taken in Libya by saying it was in the national interest to go in and prevent further massacres from occurring there. So why doesn’t the same logic apply in Syria? Vice President Biden. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: It’s a different country. It’s a different country. It is five times as large geographically. It has one-fifth the population that is Libya, one-fifth the population, five times as large geographically. It’s in a part of the world where you’re not going to see whatever would come from that war. It’s (seep ?) into a regional war. You’re in a country that is heavily populated in the midst of the most dangerous area in the world. And in fact, if, in fact, it blows up and the wrong people gain control, it’s going to have impact on the entire region, causing potentially regional wars. We are working hand in glove with the Turks, with the Jordanians, with the Saudis and with all the people in the region attempting to identify the people who deserve the help so that when Assad goes and he will go, there will be a legitimate government that follows on, not an al-Qaida-sponsored government that follows on. And all this loose talk of my friend, Governor Romney, and the congressman about how we’re going to do, we could do so much more in there, what more would they do other than put American boots on the ground? The last thing America needs is to get into another ground war in the Middle East requiring tens of thousands if not well over a hundred thousand American forces. That -- they are the facts. They are the facts. Now, every time the governor is asked about this, he doesn’t say any -- he say -- he goes up with a whole lot of verbiage, but when he gets pressed, he says, no, he would not do anything different then we are doing now. Are they proposing putting American troops on the ground, putting American aircraft in their airspace? Is that what they’re proposing? If they do, they should speak up and say so. But that’s not what they’re saying. We are doing it exactly like we need to do to identify those forces who, in fact, will provide for a stable government and not cause a regional Sunni-Shia war when Bassad (ph) -- when Bashir (sic; Bashar) Assad falls. MS. RADDATZ: Congressman Ryan. REP. RYAN: Nobody is proposing to send troops to Syria -- American troops. Now let me say it this way. How would we do things differently? We wouldn’t refer Bashar Assad as a reformer when he’s killing his own civilians with his Russian-provided weapons. We wouldn’t be outsourcing our foreign policy to the United Nations, giving Vladimir Putin veto power over our efforts to try and deal with this issue. He’s vetoed three of them. Hillary Clinton went to Russia to try and convince him not to do so; they thwarted her efforts. She said they were on the wrong side of history. She was right about that. This is just one more example of how the Russia reset’s not working. And so where are we? After international pressure mounted, then President Obama said Bashar Assad should go. It’s been over a year. The man has slaughtered tens of thousands of his own people and more foreign fighters are spilling into this country. So the longer this has gone on, the more people -- groups like al-Qaida are going in. We could have more easily identified the Free Syrian Army, the freedom fighters, working with our allies, the Turks, the Qataris, the Saudis, had we had a better plan in place to begin with, working through our allies. But no, we waited for Kofi Annan to try and come up with an agreement through the U.N. That bought Bashar Assad time. We gave Russia veto power over our efforts through the U.N. and meanwhile about 30,000 Syrians are dead. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: What would my friend do differently? If you notice, he never answers the question. REP. RYAN: No, I would -- I -- we would not be going through the U.N. on all of these things -- VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Let -- let -- let me -- you don’t go through the U.N. We are in the process now and have been for months in making sure that help, humanitarian aid, as well as other aid and training, is getting to those forces that we believe, the Turks believe, the Jordanians believe, the Saudis believe are the free forces inside of Syria. That is under way. Our allies were all on the same page, NATO as well as our Arab allies, in terms of trying to get a settlement. That was their idea. We’re the ones that said, enough. With regard to the reset not working, the fact of the matter is that Russia has a different interest in Syria than we do, and that’s not in our interest. MS. RADDATZ: What happens if Assad does not fall? Congressman Ryan, what happens to the region? What happens if he hangs on? What happens if he does? REP. RYAN: Then Iran keeps their greatest ally in the region. He’s a sponsor of terrorism. He’ll probably continue slaughtering his people. We and the world community will lose our credibility on this. Look, he mentioned the reset. MS. RADDATZ: So what would Romney-Ryan do about that credibility? REP. RYAN: Well, we agree with the same red line, actually, they do on chemical weapons, but not putting American troops in, other than to secure those chemical weapons. They’re right about that. But what we should have done earlier is work with those freedom fighters, those dissidents in Syria. We should not have called Bashar Assad a reformer, and we should not have -- we should not have waited to Russia to give us the green light -- VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: We didn’t call Assad -- MS. RADDATZ: What’s your criteria for -- REP. RYAN: We should not have waited for Russia to give us the green light at the U.N. to do something about it. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Russia -- REP. RYAN: They’re -- they’re still arming the man. Iran is flying flights over Iraq -- VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: And the opposition is being armed -- REP. RYAN: -- to help -- to help -- to help Bashar Assad. And by the way, if we had the status of forces agreement that the vice president said he would bet his vice presidency on in Iraq, we probably would have been able to prevent that. But he failed to achieve that as well. Again -- MS. RADDATZ: Let me ask you quickly, what’s your criteria for intervention? VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: I don’t -- yeah. REP. RYAN: In Syria? MS. RADDATZ: Worldwide. REP. RYAN: What is in the national interests of the American people. MS. RADDATZ: How about humanitarian interests? REP. RYAN: What is in the national security of the American people -- it’s got to be in the strategic national interests of our country. MS. RADDATZ: No humanitarian? REP. RYAN: Each situation will -- will come up with its own set of circumstances. But putting American troops on the ground, that’s got to be within the national security interests of the American people. MS. RADDATZ: I want to -- we’re almost out of time here. REP. RYAN: That means things like embargoes and sanctions and overflights -- those are things that don’t put American troops on the ground. But if you’re talking about putting American troops on the ground, only in our national security interests. MS. RADDATZ: I want to move on, and I want to return home for these last few questions. This debate is indeed historic. We have two Catholic candidates, first time on a stage such as this, and I would like to ask you both to tell me what role your religion has played in your own personal views on abortion. Please talk about how you came to that decision. Talk about how your religion played a part in that. And please, this is such an emotional issue for so many -- REP. RYAN: Sure. MS. RADDATZ: -- people in this country. Please talk personally about this if you could. Congressman Ryan. REP. RYAN: I don’t see how a person can separate their public life from their private life or from their faith. Our faith informs us in everything we do. My faith informs me about how to take care of the vulnerable, about how to make sure that people have a chance in life. Now, you want to ask basically why I’m pro-life? It’s not simply because of my Catholic faith. That’s a factor, of course, but it’s also because of reason and science. You know, I think about 10 1/2 years ago, my wife Janna and I went to Mercy Hospital in Janesville where I was born for our seven-week ultrasound for our firstborn child, and we saw that heartbeat. Our little baby was in the shape of a bean, and to this day, we have nicknamed our firstborn child, Liza, “Bean.” (Chuckles.) Now, I believe that life begins at conception. That’s why -- those are the reasons why I’m pro-life. Now, I understand this is a difficult issue. And I respect people who don’t agree with me on this. But the policy of a Romney administration will be to oppose abortion with the exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother. What troubles me more is how this administration has handled all of these issues. Look at what they’re doing through “Obamacare” with respect to assaulting the religious liberties of this country. They’re infringing upon our first freedom, the freedom of religion, by infringing on Catholic charities, Catholic churches, Catholic hospitals. Our church should not have to sue our federal government to maintain their religious -- religious liberties. And with respect to abortion, the Democratic Party used to say they want it to be safe, legal and rare. Now they support it without restriction and with taxpayer funding, taxpayer funding in “Obamacare,” taxpayer funding with foreign aid. The vice president himself went to China and said that he sympathized or wouldn’t second- guess their one-child policy of forced abortions and sterilizations. That, to me, is pretty extreme. MS. RADDATZ: Vice President Biden. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: My religion defines who I am. And I’ve been a practicing Catholic my whole life. And it has particularly informed my social doctrine. Catholic social doctrine talks about taking care of those who -- who can’t take care of themselves, people who need help. With regard to -- with regard to abortion, I accept my church’s position on abortion as a -- what we call de fide (doctrine ?). Life begins at conception. That’s the church’s judgment. I accept it in my personal life. But I refuse to impose it on equally devout Christians and Muslims and Jews and -- I just refuse to impose that on others, unlike my friend here, the congressman. I -- I do not believe that -- that we have a right to tell other people that women, they -- they can’t control their body. It’s a decision between them and their doctor, in my view. And the Supreme Court -- I’m not going to interfere with that. With regard to the assault on the Catholic Church, let me make it absolutely clear. No religious institution, Catholic or otherwise, including Catholic Social Services, Georgetown Hospital, Mercy -- any hospital -- none has to either refer contraception. None has to pay for contraception. None has to be a vehicle to get contraception in any insurance policy they provide. That is a fact. That is a fact. Now, with regard to the way in which the -- we differ, my friend says that he -- well, I guess he accepts Governor Romney’s position now, because in the past he has argued that there was -- there’s rape and forcible rape. He’s argued that, in the case of rape or incest, it was still -- it would be a crime to engage in having an abortion. I just fundamentally disagree with my friend. MS. RADDATZ: Congressman Ryan. REP. RYAN: All I’m saying is if you believe that life begins at conception, that therefore doesn’t change the definition of life. That’s a principle. The policy of a Romney administration is to oppose abortion with exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother. Now, I’ve got to take issue with the Catholic Church and religious liberty. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: You have, on the issue of Catholic social doctrine, taken issue. REP. RYAN: If they -- if they agree with you, then why would they keep -- why would they keep suing you? It’s a distinction without a difference. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: (Chuckles.) MS. RADDATZ: I want to go back to the abortion question here. If the Romney-Ryan ticket is elected, should those who believe that abortion should remain legal be worried? REP. RYAN: We don’t think that unelected judges should make this decision; that people, through their elected representatives and reaching a consensus in society through the democratic process, should make this determination. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: The court -- the next president will get one or two Supreme Court nominees. That’s how close Roe v. Wade is. Just ask yourself: With Robert Bork being the chief adviser on the court for -- for Mr. Romney, who do you think he’s likely to appoint? Do you think he’s likely to appoint someone like Scalia or someone else on the court, far right, that would outlaw Planned -- excuse me -- outlaw abortion? I suspect that would happen. I guarantee you that will not happen. We picked two people. We picked people who are open-minded. They’ve been good justices. So keep an eye on the Supreme Court -- REP. RYAN: Was there a litmus test on them? VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: There was no litmus test. We picked people who had an open mind, did not come with an agenda. MS. RADDATZ: I’m going to move on to this closing question because we are running out of time. It’s certainly known -- you’ve said it here tonight -- that the two of you respect our troops enormously. Your son has served, and perhaps someday your children will serve as well. I recently spoke to a highly decorated soldier who said that this presidential campaign has left him dismayed. He told me, quote, “The ads are so negative and they are all tearing down each other, rather than building up the country.” What would you say to that American hero about this campaign? And at the end of the day, are you ever embarrassed by the tone? Vice President Biden. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: I would say to him the same thing I say to my son, who did serve year in Iraq: that we only have one truly sacred obligation as a government. That’s to equip those we send into harm’s way and care for those who come home. That’s the only sacred obligation we have. Everything else falls behind that. I would also tell him that the fact that he, this decorated soldier you talked about, fought for his country -- that that should be honored. He should not be thrown into a category of the 47 percent who don’t pay their taxes while he was out there fighting and not having to pay taxes and somehow not taking responsibility. I would also tell him that there are things that have occurred in this campaign and occur in every campaign that I’m sure both of us regret anyone having said, particularly in these special new groups that can go out there, raise all the money they want, not have to identify themselves and say the most scurrilous things about the other candidate. It’s -- it’s -- it’s an abomination. But the bottom line here is I’d ask that hero you reference to take a look at whether or not Governor Romney or President Obama has the conviction to help lift up the middle class, restore them to where they were before this Great Recession hit and they got wiped out or whether or not he’s going to continue to focus on taking care of only the very wealthy, not asking them to make -- pay any part of the deal to bring the -- bring back the middle class, the economy of this country. I would ask him to take a look at whether the president of the United States has acted wisely in the use of force and whether or not the slipshod comments being made by my -- my friend or by Governor Romney serve -- serve our interests very well. But there are things that have been said in campaigns that I -- I find not very appealing. MS. RADDATZ: Congressman Ryan. REP. RYAN: First of all, I’d thank him to his service to our country. Second of all, I’d say, we are not going to impose these devastating cuts on our military which compromises their mission and their safety. And then I would say, you have a president who ran for president four years ago promising hope and change who has now turned his campaign into attack, blame and defame. You see, if you don’t have a good record to run on, then you paint your opponent as someone to run from. That was what President Obama said in 2008. It’s what he’s doing right now. Look at all the string of broken promises. If you like your health care plan you can keep it -- try telling that to the 20 million people who are projected to lose their health insurance if “Obamacare” goes through or the seven point million -- 7.4 million seniors who are going to lose it. Or remember when he said this: I guarantee if you make less than $250,000, your taxes won’t go up. Of the 21 tax increases in “Obamacare,” 12 of them hit the middle class. Or remember when he said, health insurance premiums will go down, and $2,500 per family per year? They’ve gone up 3,000 (dollars), and they’re expected to go up another 2,400 (dollars). Or remember when he said, I promise by the end of my first term, I’ll cut the deficit in half in four years? We’ve had four budgets, four trillion-dollar deficits. A debt crisis is coming. We can’t keep spending and borrowing like this. We can’t just keep spending money we don’t have. Leaders run to problems to fix problems. President Obama has not even put a credible plan on the table in any -- any of his four years to deal with this debt crisis. I passed two budgets to deal with this. Mitt Romney’s put ideas on the table. We’ve got to tackle this debt crisis before it tackles us. The president likes to say he has a plan. He gave a speech. We asked his budget office, can we see the plan? They sent us to this press secretary. He gave us a copy of the speech. We asked the Congressional Budget Office, tell us what President Obama’s plan is to prevent a debt crisis. They said, it’s a speech; we can’t estimate speeches. You see? That’s what we get in this administration: speeches. But we’re not getting leadership. Mitt Romney is uniquely qualified to fix these problems. His lifetime of experience, his proven track record of bipartisanship -- and what do we have from the president? He broke his big promise to bring people together to solve the country’s biggest problems. And what I would tell him is we don’t have to settle for this. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: (Inaudible.) MS. RADDATZ: I -- I -- REP. RYAN: We can do better than this. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: I hope I’ll get equal time. MS. RADDATZ: I -- you will get just a few minutes here, a few seconds, really. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: The two budgets the congressman introduced have eviscerated all the things that the middle class cares about. It has knocked 19 -- it will knock 19 million people off of Medicare. It will kick 200,000 children off of early education. It will eliminate the tax credit people have to be able to send their children to college. It cuts education by $450 billion. It -- it -- it does -- it does virtually nothing, except continue to increase the tax cuts for the very wealthy. And, you know, we’ve had enough of this. My -- the idea that these -- so concerned about these deficits, I pointed out, he voted to put two wars on a credit card. He did -- MS. RADDATZ: We’re -- we’re going to -- REP. RYAN: He voted -- MS. RADDATZ: We’re going to the closing statements in a minute. REP. RYAN: But let me -- just a second -- MS. RADDATZ: I -- you’re going to have your closing -- REP. RYAN: Not raising taxes is not cutting taxes. And by the way, our budget -- VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: We have not raised -- REP. RYAN: -- we increased spending by 3 percent a year instead of 4 1/2 percent like they proposed. MS. RADDATZ: Let me -- let me calm down things here -- REP. RYAN: So not spending more money as much as they say is not a spending cut. MS. RADDATZ: -- just for a minute. And I want to talk to you very briefly before we go to closing statements about your own personal character. If you are elected, what could you both give to this country as a man, as a human being that no one else could? REP. RYAN: Honesty. No one else could? There are plenty of fine people who could lead this country. But what you need are people who, when they say they’re going to do something, they go do it. What you need are when people see problems, they offer solutions to fix those problems. We’re not getting that. Look, we can grow this economy faster. That’s what our five-point plan for a stronger middle class is all about. It’s about getting 12 million jobs, higher take-home pay; getting people out of poverty, into the middle class. That means going with proven pro-growth policies that we know work to get people back to work, putting ideas on the table, working with Democrats -- that actually works sometimes -- and then getting things done. MS. RADDATZ: Vice President, could we get to that -- to that issue of what you could bring as a man, a human being? And I really am going to keep you to about 15 seconds here. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Well, he gets 40, I get 15, but that’s OK. That’s all right. MS. RADDATZ: He didn’t have 40. He didn’t have 40. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Now, let me tell you, I -- my -- my record stands for itself. I never say anything I don’t mean. Everybody knows whatever I say, I do. And my whole life has been devoted to leveling the playing field for middle-class people, giving them an even break, treating Main Street and Wall Street the same, holding the same responsibility. Look at my record. It’s been all about the middle class. They’re the people who grow this country. We think you grow this country from the middle out, not from the top down. MS. RADDATZ: OK. We now turn to the candidates for their closing statements. Thank you, gentlemen. And that coin toss, again, has Vice President Biden starting with a closing statement. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Well, let -- let -- let me say at the outset that I want to thank you, Martha, for doing this, and Centre College. The fact is that we’re in a situation where we inherited a god-awful circumstance. People are in real trouble. We acted to move to bring relief to the people who need the most help now. And -- and in the process, we -- in case you haven’t noticed, we have strong disagreements. But I -- you probably detected my frustration with their attitude about the -- the American people. My friend says that 30 percent of the American people are takers. They -- Romney points out, 47 percent of the people won’t take responsibility. He’s talking about my mother and father. And he’s talking about the places I grew up in, my neighbors in Scranton and Claymont. He’s talking about -- he’s talking about the people that have built this country. All they’re looking for, Martha -- all they’re looking for is an even shot. When they’ve been given the shot, they’ve done it. They’ve done it. Whenever you level the playing field, they’ve been able to move. And they want a little bit of peace of mind. And the president and I are not going to rest until that playing field is leveled, they in fact have a clear shot and they have peace of mind, until they can turn to their kid and say with a degree of confidence, honey, it’s going to be OK. It’s going to be OK. That’s what this is all about. MS. RADDATZ: Congressman Ryan. REP. RYAN: I want to thank you as well, Martha, Danville, Kentucky, Centre College. And I want to thank you, Joe. It’s been an honor to engage in this critical debate. We face a very big choice. What kind of country are we going to be? What kind of country are we going to give our kids? President Obama -- he had his chance. He made his choices. His economic agenda, more spending, more borrowing, higher taxes, a government takeover of health care -- it’s not working. It’s failed to create the jobs we need. Twenty-three million Americans are struggling for work today. Fifteen percent of Americans are in poverty. This is not what a real recovery looks like. You deserve better. Mitt Romney and I want to earn your support. We’re offering real reforms for a real recovery for every American. Mitt Romney, his experience, his ideas, his solutions, is uniquely qualified to get this job done. At a time when we have a jobs crisis in America, wouldn’t it be nice to have a job creator in the White House? The choice is clear: a stagnant economy that promotes more government dependency, or a dynamic, growing economy that promotes opportunity and jobs. Mitt Romney and I will not duck the tough issues. We will take responsibility. And we will not try to replace our founding principles; we will reapply our founding principles. The choice is clear, and the choice rests with you, and we ask you for your vote. Thank you. MS. RADDATZ: And thank you both again. Thank you very much. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Thank you. MS. RADDATZ: This concludes the vice presidential debate. Please tune in next Tuesday for the second presidential debate at Hofstra University in New York. I’m Martha Raddatz of ABC News. I do hope all of you go to the polls. Have a good evening. (Applause.) END We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think."
"Transcript: Democratic Presidential Debate in Brooklyn","Advertisement Supported by BLITZER: Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders, you can now move to your lecterns while I explain a few ground rules. As moderator, I’ll guide the discussion, asking questions and follow-ups. You’ll also get questions from Dana Bash and Errol Louis. You’ll each have one minute and 15 seconds to answer questions, 30 seconds for follow- ups. Timing lights will signal when your time is up. Both candidates have agreed to these rules now. Opening statements, you’ll each have two minutes. Let’s begin with Senator Sanders. (APPLAUSE) SANDERS: Wolf, thank you very much. CNN, thank you very much. Secretary Clinton, thank you very much. When we began this campaign almost a year ago, we started off at 3 percent in the polls. We were about 70 points behind Secretary Clinton. In the last couple of weeks, there were two polls out there that had us ahead. (APPLAUSE) Of the last nine caucuses and primaries, we have won eight of them, many of them by landslide victories. (APPLAUSE) Over the last year, we have received almost 7 million individual campaign contributions, averaging — guess what — $27 apiece, more individual campaign contributions than any candidate in American history at this point in a campaign. The reason that our campaign has done so well is because we’re doing something very radical: We’re telling the American people the truth. And the truth is that this country is not going to move forward in a significant way for working people unless we overturn this disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision... (APPLAUSE) ... and unless we have real campaign reform so that billionaires and super PACs cannot buy elections. (APPLAUSE) This campaign is also determined to end a rigged economy where the rich get richer and everybody else get poorer, and create an economy that works for all of us, not just the 1 percent. Thank you. BLITZER: Secretary Clinton? CLINTON: Well, first of all, it’s great to be here in New York, and I am delighted to... (APPLAUSE) ... have this chance to discuss the issues that are important to our future. I was so honored to serve as a senator from New York for eight years... (APPLAUSE) ... and to work to provide opportunity for all of our citizens to make it possible that we could knock down the barriers that stand in the way of people getting ahead and staying ahead. And during those eight years, we faced some difficult challenges together. We faced 9/11. We worked hard to rebuild New York. I was particularly concerned about our first responders and others who’d been affected in their health by what they had experienced. We worked hard to bring jobs from Buffalo to Albany and all parts of New York to give more hard-working people a chance to really make the most out of their own talents. And we worked hard to really keep New York values at the center of who we are and what we do together. (APPLAUSE) And that is — that is exactly what I want to do as your president. We will celebrate our diversity. We will work together, bringing us back to being united, setting some big, bold, progressive goals for America. That’s what I’m offering in this campaign, to build on the work, to build on the value that we share here in New York, to take those to Washington, and to knock down those barriers that in any way hold back not only individual Americans, bur our country from reaching our full potential. That is what my campaign is about. (APPLAUSE) BLITZER: Thank you, Secretary. We are going to deal with many of the issues both of you just raised. I want to begin with a question that goes right to the heart of which one of you should be the Democratic presidential nominee. BLITZER: Senator Sanders, in the last week, you’ve raised questions about Secretary Clinton’s qualifications to be president. You said that something is clearly lacking in terms of her judgment and you accused her of having a credibility gap. So let me ask you, do you believe that Secretary Clinton has the judgment to be president? SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (D-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, I’ve known Secretary Clinton, how long, 25 years? We worked together in the Senate. And I said that in response to the kind of attacks we were getting from the Clinton, uh, campaign. “Washington Post” headline says “Clinton Campaign says Sanders is Unqualified” and that’s what the surrogates were saying. Does Secretary Clinton have the experience and the intelligence to be a president? Of course she does. (APPLAUSE) SANDERS: But I do question... (APPLAUSE) SANDERS: — but I do question her judgment. I question a judgment which voted for the war in Iraq... (APPLAUSE) SANDERS: — the worst foreign policy blunder in the history of this country, voted for virtually every disastrous trade agreement which cost us millions of decent-paying jobs. And I question her judgment about running super PACs which are collecting tens of millions of dollars from special interests, including $15 million from Wall Street. I don’t believe that that is... (APPLAUSE) SANDERS: — the kind of judgment we need to be the kind of president we need. BLITZER: Secretary Clinton? HILLARY CLINTON (D-NY), FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, it is true that now that the spotlight is pretty bright here in New York, some things have been said and Senator Sanders did call me unqualified. I’ve been called a lot of things in my life. That was a first. (LAUGHTER) CLINTON: And then he did say that... (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: — he had to question my judgment. Well, the people of New York voted for me twice to be their senator from New York and... (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: — and... (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: — and President Obama trusted my judgment enough to ask me to be secretary of State for the United States. (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: So, look, we have disagreements on policy. There’s no doubt about it. But if you go and read, which I hope all of you will before Tuesday, Senator Sanders’ long interview with the “New York Daily News,” talk about judgment and talk about the kinds of problems he had answering questions about even his core issue, breaking up the banks. When asked, he could not explain how... (LAUGHTER) CLINTON: — that would be done and... (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: — when asked... (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: — when asked about a number of foreign policy issues, he could not answer about Afghanistan, about Israel, about counterterrorism, except to say if he’d had some paper in front of him, maybe he could. I think you need to have the judgment on day one to be both president and commander-in-chief. BLITZER: Senator... (APPLAUSE) SANDERS: And let’s talk about judgment. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes! (APPLAUSE) SANDERS: And let us talk about the worst foreign policy blunder in the modern history of this country... (APPLAUSE) SANDERS: I led the opposition to that war. Secretary Clinton voted for that. Well, let’s talk about judgment. Let’s talk about super PACs and 501(c)(4)s, money which is completely undisclosed. Where does the money come from? Do we really feel confident about a candidate saying that she’s going to bring change in America when she is so dependent on big money interests? I don’t think so. (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: Well, let me... SANDERS: We have... CLINTON: — let me just say... SANDERS: — (INAUDIBLE)... CLINTON: — let me — let me say... BLITZER: Madam Secretary, let him finish. CLINTON: OK. SANDERS: Thirdly, we have got to understand that in America, we should be thinking big, not small. (APPLAUSE) BLITZER: Thank you. SANDERS: We need to join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee health care to all people. So I... (APPLAUSE) SANDERS: — my (INAUDIBLE). BLITZER: Thank you, Senator. Secretary? CLINTON: Well, make — make no mistake about it, this is not just an attack on me, it’s an attack on President Obama. President Obama... (BOOS) CLINTON: You know, let me tell you why. You may not like the answer, but I’ll tell you why. President Obama had a super PAC when he ran. President Obama took tens of millions of dollars from contributors. And President Obama was not at all influenced when he made the decision to pass and sign Dodd-Frank, the toughest regulations... (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: — on Wall Street in many a year. CLINTON: So this is — this is a phony — this is a phony attack that is designed to raise questions when there is no evidence or support, to undergird the continuation that he is putting forward in these attacks. BLITZER: Thank, Secretary. We’re going to continue on this, but I want Dana Bash to continue with the questioning. BASH: Secretary Clint, the government announced yesterday that five of the biggest banks on Wall Street have failed to develop plans to dismantle themselves in the event of another financial crisis. This is the second time in two years those banks neglected to come up with credible plans. So, as president, would you call on regulators to start the process of breaking up these banks? Something that the law not only allows, but actually explicitly encourages? CLINTON: Absolutely. You know, this is what I’ve saying for the past year. No bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail. I have been talking about what we should be doing under Dodd- Frank. I’m glad that Senator Sanders is now joining in talking about Dodd-Frank, because Dodd-Frank sets forth the approach that needs to be taken. I believe, and I will appoint regulators who are tough enough and ready enough to break up any bank that fails the test under Dodd-Frank. There are two sections there. If they fail either one, that they’re a systemic risk, a grave risk to our economy, or if they fail the other, that their living wills, which is what you’re referring to, is inadequate. Let’s look at what is at stake here. We can never let Wall Street wreck Main street again. I spoke out against Wall Street when I was a Senator from New York. I have been standing up and saying continuously we have the law. We’ve got to execute under it. So, you’re right. I will move immediately to break up any financial institution, but I go further because I want the law to extend to those that are part of the shadow banking industry. The big insurance companies, the hedge funds, something that I have been arguing for now a long time... BASH: ... Thank you, Secretary. Senator Sanders, you were recently asked what you would replace the big Wall Street banks with if you could break them up. You said, quote, “That’s their decision.” Why would you trust the banks to restructure themselves? SANDERS: First, Dana... BASH: when you said the whole business model was fraudulent? SANDERS: That’s right. So, let’s start off with the basic premise. A few days ago Goldman Sachs formally reached a settlement with the United States government for $5 billion dollars. What Goldman Sachs acknowledged was, essentially, that they were selling fraudulent packages of subprime mortgage loans. Goldman Sachs was not the only bank, other banks, of course, did the same. Now, I don’t need Dodd-Frank now to tell me that we have got to break up these banks, A, because they’re based on fraudulent principles, and B, because when you have six financial institutions that have assets equivalent to 58% of the GFP of this country, they are just too big, too much concentration of wealth and power. BASH: But, Senator... SANDERS: The point is we have got to break them up so that they do not pose a systemic risk and so that we have a vibrant economy with a competitive financial system. BASH: But Senator, you didn’t answer the specific question which is not just about breaking up the banks, but why allow the banks to do it themselves? SANDERS: Because I’m not sure that the government should say is you are too big to fail. You’ve got to be a certain size. And, then the banks themselves can figure out what they want to sell off. I don’t know that it’s appropriate that the Department of Treasury to be making those decisions. What we need is to make sure that they are safe. (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: Dana, you know — I love being in Brooklyn. (APPLAUSE) (CHEERING) CLINTON: Dana, let me add here that there are two ways to at this under Dodd-Frank, which is after all the law we passed under President Obama, and I’m proud that Barney Frank, one of the authors, has endorsed me because what I have said continuously is, yes, sometimes the government may have to order certain actions. Sometime the government can permit the institution themselves to take those actions. That has to be the judgement of the regulators. But, there’s another element to this. I believe strongly that executives of any of these organizations should be financially penalized if there is a settlement. (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: They should have to pay up through compensation or bonuses because we have to go after not just the big giant institution, we have got to go after the people who are making the decisions in the institutions. BASH: Thank you, Madam Secretary. CLINTON: And hold them accountable as well. (APPLAUSE) BASH: Senator Sanders, you have consistently criticized Secretary Clinton for accepting money from Wall Street. Can you name one decision that she made as senator that shows that he favored banks because of the money she received? SANDERS: Sure. Sure. The obvious decision is when the greed and recklessness and illegal behavior of wall street brought this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession — the Great Depression of the ’30s, when millions of people lost their jobs, and their homes, and their life savings, the obvious response to that is that you’ve got a bunch of fraudulent operators and that they have got to be broken up. That was my view way back, and I introduced legislation to do that. Now, Secretary Clinton was busy giving speeches to Goldman Sachs for $225,000 a speech. (APPLAUSE) SANDERS: So the problem response — the proper response in my view is we should break them up. And that’s what my legislation does. CLINTON: Well, you can tell, Dana, he cannot come up with any example, because there is no example. (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: It is important — it’s always important. It may be inconvenient, but it’s always important to get the facts straight. I stood up against the behaviors of the banks when I was a senator. I called them out on their mortgage behavior. I also was very willing to speak out against some of the special privileges they had under the tax code. When I went to the secretary of state office, the president — President Obama led the effort to pass the Dodd-Frank bill. That is the law. Now, this is our ninth debate. In the prior eight debates, I have said, we have a law. You don’t just say, we’re upset about this. I’m upset about it. You don’t just say, go break them up. You have a law, because we are a nation of laws. BASH: Thank you, Madam Secretary. CLINTON: So I support Dodd-Frank, but I have consistently said that’s not enough. We’ve got to include the shadow banking sector. BASH: Thank you. Senator Sanders. (APPLAUSE) SANDERS: Secretary Clinton called them out. Oh my goodness, they must have been really crushed by this. And was that before or after you received huge sums of money by giving speaking engagements? So they must have been very, very upset by what you did. Look, here is the difference and here is the clear difference. These banks, in my view, have too much power. They have shown themselves to be fraudulent organizations endangering the well-being of our economy. If elected president, I will break them up. We have got legislation to do that, end of discussion. (APPLAUSE) BASH: Secretary Clinton, if I may, Senator Sanders keeping bringing up the speeches that you gave to Goldman Sachs. So I’d like to ask you, so you’ve said that you don’t want to release the transcripts, until everybody does it, but if there’s nothing in those speeches that you think would change voters’ minds, why not just release the transcripts and put this whole issue to bed? (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: You know, first of all — first of all, there isn’t an issue. When I was in public service serving as the senator from New York, I did stand up to the banks. I did make it clear that their behavior would not be excused. I’m the only one on this stage who did not vote to deregulate swaps and derivatives, as Senator Sanders did, which led to a lot of the problems that we had with Lehman Brothers. Now, if you’re going to look at the problems that actually caused the Great Recession, you’ve got to look at the whole picture. It was a giant insurance company, AIG. It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers. It was mortgage companies like Countrywide. I’m not saying that Senator Sanders did something untoward when he voted to deregulate swaps and derivatives... BASH: Madam Secretary... CLINTON: ... but the fact is he did. CLINTON: And that contributed to the collapse of Lehman Brothers and started the cascade... (APPLAUSE) (CROSSTALK) BASH: Senator Sanders, one second, please. Secretary Clinton, the question was about the transcripts of the speeches to Goldman Sachs. (APPLAUSE) Why not release them? CLINTON: I have said, look, there are certain — there are certain expectations when you run for president. This is a new one. And I’ve said, if everybody agrees to do it — because there are speeches for money on the other side. I know that. But I will tell you this, there is — there is a long-standing expectation that everybody running release their tax returns, and you can go — you can go to my website and see eight years of tax returns. And I’ve released 30 years of tax returns. And I think every candidate, including Senator Sanders and Donald Trump, should do the same. (APPLAUSE) BASH: Secretary Clinton, we’re going to get to the tax returns later, but just to put a button on this, you’re running now for the Democratic nomination. CLINTON: Right. BASH: And it is your Democratic opponent and many Democratic voters who want to see those transcripts. It’s not about the Republicans... (CROSSTALK) (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: You know, let’s set the same standard for everybody. When everybody does it, OK, I will do it, but let’s set and expect the same standard on tax returns. Everybody does it, and then we move forward. BLITZER: Thank you. SANDERS: Well, let me respond. Secretary Clinton, you just heard her, everybody else does it, she’ll do it. I will do it. (APPLAUSE) I am going to release all of the transcripts of the speeches that I gave on Wall Street behind closed doors, not for $225,000, not for $2,000, not for two cents. There were no speeches. (APPLAUSE) And second of all, of course we will release our taxes. Jane does our taxes. We’ve been a little bit busy lately. You’ll excuse us. But we will... BLITZER: Senator... SANDERS: We will get them out. BLITZER: Senator... CLINTON: Well, you know, there are a lot of copy machines around. BLITZER: Senator, when are you — when are you — you’ve been asked for weeks and weeks to release your tax returns. SANDERS: Well, I think we got one that’s coming out tomorrow. BLITZER: Which one? SANDERS: Last year’s. BLITZER: 2014? SANDERS: Yes. BLITZER: What about 2013, all the other ones? SANDERS: You’ll get them, yes. Yeah, look, I don’t want to get anybody very excited. They are very boring tax returns. No big money from speeches, no major investments. Unfortunately — unfortunately, I remain one of the poorer members of the United States Senate. And that’s what that will show. (APPLAUSE) BLITZER: So, Senator, just to be clear, tomorrow you will release the 2014 tax returns from you and your family? SANDERS: Yes. BLITZER: And what about the earlier ones? What’s the problem... SANDERS: Yes. BLITZER: What’s taking so long? Because you just have to go to the filing cabinet, make a copy, and release them. (APPLAUSE) SANDERS: Wolf, the answer is, you know, what we have always done in my family is, Jane does them. And she’s been out on the campaign trail. We will get them out. We’ll get them out very shortly. It’s not a big deal. BLITZER: Thank you. Senator, Senator, you’ve slammed companies like General Electric and Verizon for moving jobs outside of the United States. Yesterday, the CEO of Verizon called your views contemptable and said in your home state of Vermont Verizon has invested more than $16 million and pays millions of dollars a year to local businesses. He says you are, quote, “uninformed on this issue” and disconnected from reality. Given your obvious contempt for large American corporations, how would you as president of the United States be able to effectively promote American businesses around the world? SANDERS: Well, for a start, I would tell the gentleman who’s the CEO at Verizon to start negotiating with the Communication Workers of America. (APPLAUSE) And this is — this is a perfect example, Wolf, of the kind of corporate greed which is destroying the middle class of this country. This gentleman makes $18 million a year in salary. That’s his — that’s his compensation. This gentleman is now negotiating to take away health care benefits of Verizon workers, outsource call center jobs to the Philippines, and — and trying to create a situation where workers will lose their jobs. He is not investing in the way he should in inner cities in America. (APPLAUSE) BLITZER: All right. Senator, but the question was, the question was, given your contempt for large American corporations, as president, how would you be able to promote American business around the world? SANDERS: First of all, the word contempt is not right. There are some great businesses who treat their workers and the environment with respect. (APPLAUSE) SANDERS: Verizon happens not to be one of them. (APPLAUSE) SANDERS: And what we need to do is to tell this guy Immelt, who’s the head of General Electric, he doesn’t like me, well, that’s fine. He has outsourced hundreds of thousands of decent-paying jobs throughout the world... (APPLAUSE) SANDERS: — cut his workforce here substantially and in a given year, by the way, it turns out that both Verizon and General Electric, in a given year, pay nothing in federal income tax despite making billions in profits. (BOOS) BLITZER: But Senator, experts say that no matter the means to bring back these jobs to the United States, prices of goods for consumers in the United States would go up, which would disproportionately impact the poor and middle class. So how do you bring back these jobs to the United States without affecting the cost of goods to America’s middle class and poor? SANDERS: Well, for a start, we’re going to raise the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour. (APPLAUSE) SANDERS: And number two, while it is true we may end up paying a few cents more for a hamburger in McDonald’s, at the end of the day, what this economy desperately needs is to rebuild our manufacturing sector with good-paying jobs. (APPLAUSE) SANDERS: We cannot continue to sustain the loss of millions of decent-paying jobs that we have seen over the last 20, 30 years, based on trade agreements of which Secretary Clinton has voted for almost every one of those. That has got to change. BLITZER: Thank you. Secretary... (LAUGHTER) BLITZER: — Secretary Clinton? (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: Well, first of all, I do have a very comprehensive plan to create more jobs and I think that has to be at the center of our economic approach. And so I think it is important that we do more on manufacturing. I went to Syracuse and laid out a $10 billion plan that would, I believe, really jump-start advanced manufacturing. I have seen the results of what can happen when we have the government cooperating with business. And that’s exactly what I will do. When I was secretary of State, I helped to lead the way to increased exports of American good around the world, which supports tens of thousands of jobs. So I think you’ve got to go at this with a sense of how to accomplish the goal we are setting — more good jobs with rising incomes for people everywhere from inner cities to rural areas to every distressed community in America. And that’s exactly what my plan would bring about. I think we have a pretty good record if we look at what happened... BLITZER: Senator... CLINTON: — in the 1990s, we got 23 million new jobs and incomes went up for everybody. BLITZER: Thank you. CLINTON: Let’s do that again in America. BLITZER: Senator, how do you... SANDERS: I’m going to respond... BLITZER: I’ll have you respond in a moment. (APPLAUSE) BLITZER: Stand by. SANDERS: Well, look... BLITZER: Secretary Clinton... (CROSSTALK) BLITZER: You will respond in a moment, but I have to follow-up with Secretary Clinton. You stood on the stage with Governor Cuomo in support of new legislation to raise New York’s minimum wage to $15 an hour. But you do not support raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. As president... (APPLAUSE) BLITZER: — if a Democratic Congress put a $15 minimum wage bill on your desk, would you sign it? CLINTON: Well, of course I would. And I have supported... (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: — I have supported the fight for 15. I am proud to have the endorsement of most of the unions that have led the fight for 15. I was proud to stand on the stage with Governor Cuomo, with SEIU and others who have been leading this battle and I will work as hard as I can to raise the minimum wage. I always have. I supported that when I was in the Senate. SANDERS: Well, look... CLINTON: But what I have also said is that we’ve got to be smart about it, just the way Governor Cuomo was here in New York. If you look at it, we moved more quickly to $15 in New York City, more deliberately toward $12, $12.50 upstate then to $15. That is exactly my position. It’s a model for the nation and that’s what I will do as president. BLITZER: Thank you. CLINTON: Go as quickly as... (CROSSTALK) CLINTON: — to get to $15. (APPLAUSE) SANDERS: I am sure a lot of people are very surprised to learn that you supported raising the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour. (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: You know, wait a minute... SANDERS: (INAUDIBLE). CLINTON: — wait a minute. SANDERS: (INAUDIBLE). CLINTON: — wait, wait... SANDERS: That’s just not accurate. Well... CLINTON: Come on, I have stood on the debate stage... SANDERS: — well and I... CLINTON: — with Senator Sanders eight... (CROSSTALK) CLINTON: — times. SANDERS: Excuse me. CLINTON: I have said the... SANDERS: Well... CLINTON: Exact same thing. BLITZER: Secretary, Senator, please. CLINTON: If we can... (CROSSTALK) CLINTON: — raise it to $15 in New York... (CROSSTALK) CLINTON: — or Los Angeles or Seattle... BLITZER: Secretary, the viewers... CLINTON: — let’s do it. BLITZER: If you’re both screaming at each other, the viewers won’t be able to hear either of you. SANDERS: OK. BLITZER: So please... SANDERS: I will... BLITZER: — don’t talk over each other. SANDERS: I believe I was... (CROSSTALK) BLITZER: Go ahead. SANDERS: — responding. All right? When this campaign began, I said that we got to end the starvation minimum wage of $7.25, raise it to $15. Secretary Clinton said let’s raise it to $12. There’s a difference. And, by the way, what has happened is history has outpaced Secretary Clinton, because all over this country, people are standing up and they’re saying $12 is not good enough, we need $15 an hour. CLINTON: OK. (APPLAUSE) BLITZER: Go ahead, Secretary. Secretary? SANDERS: And suddenly... BLITZER: Secretary, go ahead. SANDERS: To suddenly... CLINTON: Thank you. Thank you very much. SANDERS: To suddenly announce now that you’re for $15, I don’t think is quite accurate. BLITZER: All right. Secretary? CLINTON: All right. I have said from the very beginning that I supported the fight for $15. I supported those on the front lines of the fight for — it happens to be true. I also — I supported the $15 effort in L.A. I supported in Seattle. I supported it for the fast food workers in New York. The minimum wage at the national level right now is $7.25, right? We want to raise it higher than it ever has been, but we also have to recognize some states and some cities will go higher, and I support that. I have taken my cue from the Democrats in the Senate, led by Senator Patty Murray and others, like my good friend Kirsten Gillibrand, who has said we will set a national level of $12 and then urge any place that can go above it to go above it. Going from $7.25 to $12 is a huge difference. Thirty-five million people will get a raise. One in four working mothers will get a raise. I want to get something done. And I think setting the goal to get to $12 is the way to go, encouraging others to get to $15. But, of course, if we have a Democratic Congress, we will go to $15. (APPLAUSE) BLITZER: Senator, go ahead. SANDERS: Well, I think the secretary has confused a lot of people. I don’t know how you’re there for the fight for $15 when you say you want a $12-an-hour national minimum wage. (APPLAUSE) Now, in fact — in fact, there is an effort, Patty Murray has introduced legislation for $12 minimum wage. That’s good. I introduced legislation for $15 an hour minimum wage which is better. (APPLAUSE) And ultimately what we have got to determine is after massive transfer of wealth from the middle class to the top 0.1 percent, when millions of our people are working longer hours for low wages... BLITZER: Thank you, Senator. SANDERS: I think we have got to be clear, not equivocate, $15 in minimum wage in 50 states in this country as soon as possible. BLITZER: Thank you. (APPLAUSE) We’re going to turn to another critically important issue right now, guns in America. Secretary Clinton, you’ve said that Vermont, Senator Sanders’ home state, has, quote, “the highest per capita number of guns that end up committing crimes in New York.” But only 1.2 percent of the guns recovered in New York in 2014 were from Vermont. Are you seriously blaming Vermont, and implicitly Senator Sanders, for New York’s gun violence? CLINTON: No, of course not. Of course not. This is — this is a serious difference between us. (LAUGHTER) And what I want to start by saying — it’s not a laughing matter — 90 people on average a day are killed or commit suicide or die in accidents from guns, 33,000 people a year. I take it really seriously, because I have spent more time than I care to remember being with people who have lost their loved ones. So, yes, we have a problem in America. We need a president who will stand up against the gun lobby. We need a president who will fight for commonsense gun safety reforms. (APPLAUSE) And what we have here is a big difference. Senator Sanders voted against the Brady Bill five times. He voted for the most important NRA priority, namely giving immunity from liability to gun-makers and dealers, something that is at the root of a lot of the problems that we are facing. Then he doubled down on that in the New York Daily News interview, when asked whether he would support the Sandy Hook parents suing to try to do something to rein in the advertising of the AR-15, which is advertised to young people as being a combat weapon, killing on the battlefield. He said they didn’t deserve their day in court. CLINTON: I could not disagree more. And, finally, this is the only industry in America, the only one. (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: That has this kind of special protection. We hear a lot from Senator Sanders about the greed and recklessness of Wall Street, and I agree. We’ve got to hold Wall Street accountable... BLITZER: ... Thank you... CLINTON: ... Well, what about the greed and recklessness of gun manufacturers and dealers in America? (APPLAUSE) (CHEERING) BLITZER: Senator? Well, the only problem is, Wolf, she didn’t answer your question. You asked her whether she thought that Vermont was responsible. You asked her whether she thought that Vermont was responsible for a lot of the gun violence. You made the point what she said was totally absurd. BLITZER: I asked her, are you seriously blaming Vermont and implicitly Senator Sanders for New York’s gun violence. She said no. But, go ahead. SANDERS: Then why did she put out that statement? CLINTON: I put it out... SANDERS: ... Excuse me, I think I’m responding now. BLITZER: Please, go ahead sir. SANDERS: A statement that was refuted by the governor of the state of Vermont, who was a supporter of hers, who said, yeah, in campaigns people tend to exaggerate. Here is the fact on guns. Let’s talk about guns. That horrible, horrible Sandy Hook — what’s the word we want to use, murder, assault, slaughter, unspeakable act. Back in 1988, I ran for the United States Congress one seat in the state of Vermont. I probably lost that election, which I lost by three points, because I was the only candidate running who said, you know what? We should ban assault weapons, not seen them sold or distributed in the United States of America. I’ve got a D-minus voting record from the NRA. (APPLAUSE) And, in fact, because I come from a state which has virtually no gun control, I believe that I am the best qualified candidate to bring back together that consensus that is desperately needed in this country. (APPLAUSE) BLITZER: Thank you, Senator. Thank you. (CHEERING) BLITZER: Secretary Clinton, I want you to respond to that, but why did you put out that statement blaming Vermont and its gun policy for some of the death of — by guns in New York? CLINTON: Well, the facts are that most of the guns that end up committing crimes in New York come from out of state. They come from the states that don’t have kind of serious efforts to control guns that we do in New York. But let me say this — in 1988, as we’ve heard on every debate occasion, Senator Sanders did run for the Congress and he lost. He came back in 1990 and he won, and during that campaign he made a commitment to the NRA that he would be against waiting periods. And, in fact, in his own book, he talks about his 1990 campaign, and here’s what he said. He clearly was helped by the NRA, because they ran ads against his opponent. So, then he went to the Congress, where he has been a largely very reliable supporter of the NRA. Voting — he kept his word to the NRA, he voted against the Brady Bill five times because it had waiting periods in it. Thankfully, enough people finally voted for it to keep guns out of the hands of who should not have them. (APPLAUSE) BLITZER: Senator, I want you to respond, but I also want you to respond to this. You recently said you do not think crime victims should be able to sue gun makers for damages. The daughter of the Sandy Hook Elementary School who was killed back in the 2012 mass shooting, says you owe her and families an apology. Do you? SANDERS: What we need to do is to do everything that we can to make certain that guns do not fall into the hands of people who do not have them. Now, I voted against this gun liability law because I was concerned that in rural areas all over this country, if a gun shop owner sells a weapon legally to somebody, and that person then goes out and kills somebody, I don’t believe it is appropriate that that gun shop owner who just sold a legal weapon to be held accountable and be sued. But, what I do believe is when gun shop owners and others knowingly are selling weapons to people who should not have them — somebody walks in.SANDERS: They want thousands of rounds of ammunition, or they want a whole lot of guns, yes, that gun shop owner or that gun manufacturer should be held liable. BLITZER: So, Senator, do you owe the Sandy Hook families an apology? SANDERS: No, I don’t think I owe them an apology. They are in court today, and actually they won a preliminary decision today. They have the right to sue, and I support them and anyone else who wants the right to sue. CLINTON: Well, I believe that the law that Senator Sanders voted for that I voted against, giving this special protection to gun manufacturers and to dealers, is an absolute abdication of responsibility on the part of those who voted for it. This is a — this is a unique gift given to only one industry in the world by the United States Congress, as Senator Murphy from Connecticut said, we have tougher standards holding toy gun manufacturers and sellers to account than we do for real guns. And the point that Senator Sanders keeps making about how he wouldn’t want a mom and pop store — that was not the point of this. And if he can point to any, any incident where that happened, I would love to hear about it. What was really going on, I’ll tell you, because it has a lot to do with New York City. New York City was on the brink of being able to hold manufacturers and dealers accountable through a very carefully crafted legal strategy. BLITZER: Thank you. CLINTON: The NRA came to their supporters in the Congress and said, stop it, stop it now, and Senator Sanders joined those who did. BLITZER: Thank you, Secretary. Senator, go ahead. SANDERS: Let me just reiterate — just reiterate so there is no confusion, decades ago, before it was popular, in a rural state with no gun control, Bernie Sanders said, let’s ban assault weapons, not see them distributed in the United States of America. BLITZER: Thank you, Senator. Let’s turn it over to Errol Lewis, of New York 1 Time Warner Cable News. LOUIS: Secretary Clinton, the 1994 crime bill that you supported added 100,000 police officers across the country and banned certain assault weapons. It also imposed tougher prison sentences and eliminated federal funding for inmate education. Looking at the bill as a whole, do you believe it was a net positive or do you think it was a mistake? CLINTON: Well, I think that it had some positive aspects to it. And you mentioned some of them. The Violence Against Women Act, which has been a very important piece of legislation, in my opinion. (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: And it also did some things which were to provide more opportunities for young people. So if we were to have the balance sheet on one side, there are some positive actions and changes. On the other side, there were decisions that were made that now we must revisit and we have to correct. I think that sentences got much too long. The original idea was not that we would increase sentences for non-violent low-level offenders, but once the federal government did what it did, states piled on. So we have a problem. And the very first speech I gave in this campaign was about what I will do to reform the criminal justice system and end the over-mass incarceration. So I think that if all of us go and look back at where we were, Senator Sanders voted for the crime bill, and he says the same thing, there were some good things, and things that we have to change and learn from. So that’s how I see it. And I think we ought to be putting our attention on forging a consensus to make the changes that will divert more people from the criminal justice system to start. LOUIS: Thank you, Secretary. CLINTON: To tackle systemic racism and divert people in the beginning. LOUIS: Now earlier this year, a South Carolina voter told your daughter Chelsea, quote, “I think a lot of African-Americans want to hear, you know what, we made a mistake.” Chelsea said she has heard you apologize, but went on to say that if the voter hadn’t heard it then, quote, “it’s clearly insufficient.” Do you regret your advocacy for the crime bill? CLINTON: Well, look, I supported the crime bill. My husband has apologized. He was the president who actually signed it, Senator Sanders... LOUIS: But what about you, Senator? CLINTON: ... voted for it. I’m sorry for the consequences that were unintended and that have had a very unfortunate impact on people’s lives. I’ve seen the results of what has happened in families and in communities. CLINTON: That’s why I chose to make my very first speech a year ago on this issue, Errol, because I want to focus the attention of our country and to make the changes we need to make. And I also want people... (APPLAUSE) ... especially I want — I want white people — I want white people to recognize that there is systemic racism. It’s also in employment, it’s in housing, but it is in the criminal justice system, as well. (APPLAUSE) LOUIS: Senator Sanders, earlier this week at the Apollo Theater in Harlem, you called out President Clinton for defending Secretary Clinton’s use of the term super-predator back in the ’90s when she supported the crime bill. Why did you call him out? SANDERS: Because it was a racist term, and everybody knew it was a racist term. (APPLAUSE) Look, much of what Secretary Clinton said was right. We had a crime bill. I voted for it. It had the Violence Against Women Act in it. When as mayor of Burlington, we worked very hard to try to eliminate domestic violence. This took us a good step forward. We’re talking about the weapon that killed the children in Sandy Hook. This banned assault weapons, not insignificant. But where we are today is we have a broken criminal justice system. We have more people in jail than any other country on Earth. And in my view, what we have got to do is rethink the system from the bottom on up. And that means, for a start — and we don’t talk about this. The media doesn’t talk about it — you got 51 percent of African-American kids today who graduated high school who are unemployed or underemployed. You know what I think? Maybe we invest in jobs and education for those kids, not jails and incarceration. (APPLAUSE) And I’ll tell you what else. And I’ll tell you what else I think. And that is, we have got — and this is the difference between the secretary and myself as I understand it. We have got to have the guts to rethink the so-called war on drugs. Too many lives... BLITZER: Thank you, Senator. SANDERS: Too many lives have been destroyed because people possessed marijuana, millions over a 30-year period. And that is why I believe we should take marijuana out of the federal Controlled Substance Act. (APPLAUSE) LOUIS: Thank you. Thank you. Let’s — let’s get Secretary Clinton’s response. CLINTON: Well, look, I think that, as Senator Sanders said about what I said, I will say about what he said. I think that we recognize that we have a set of problems that we cannot ignore and we must address. And that is why I have been promoting for my entire adult life, I think, the idea of investing early in kids, early childhood education, universal pre-K, like what Mayor de Blasio brought to New York. We have got to help more kids get off to a good start. That’s why I want a good teacher in a good school for every child, regardless of the ZIP Code that child lives in... LOUIS: Thank you. Thank you, Secretary Clinton. (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: ... and to be really focused on how we build ladders of opportunity and tear down these barriers that stand in the way of people getting ahead. LOUIS: Your time’s up, Secretary Clinton. Senator Sanders, I have a question for you related to this. So you’ve said that by the end of your first term as president, the U.S. will no longer lead the world in mass incarceration. To fulfill that promise, you’d have to release roughly half a million prisoners. How are you going to do that, since the vast majority of American prisoners are not under federal jurisdiction? SANDERS: We’re going to work with state governments all over this country. And you know what? In a very divided Congress, and a very divided politics in America, actually the one area where there is some common ground is conservatives understand that it’s insane to be spending $80 billion a year locking up 2.2 million people. With federal and presidential leadership, we will work with state governments to make sure that people are released from jail under strong supervision, that they get the kind of job training and education they need so they can return to their communities. On this one, Errol, actually I think you’re going to see progressive and conservative support. We can do it, if we’re prepared to be bold. BLITZER: Thank you, Senator. Thank you, Secretary. We have to take a quick commercial break. We have a lot more questions for Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders right after this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BLITZER: Welcome back. Let’s turn to another critically important issue. Senator, Secretary, the issue of energy and the environment. Secretary Clinton, Senator Sanders has said you are in the pocket of the fossil fuel industry. You say you’re sick and tired of him lying about your record. What are his lies? CLINTON: Well, let me start by saying we need to talk about this issue and we should talk about it in terms of the extraordinary threats that climate change pose to our country and our world. And that’s why for the last many years, both in the Senate and as secretary of State, it’s been a big part of my commitment to see what could be done. But there has never been any doubt that when I was a senator, I tried — I joined with others to try to get rid of the subsidies for big oil. And I have proposed that again, because that’s what I think needs to be done as we transition from fossil fuels to clean energy. CLINTON: And everyone who’s looked at this independently, “The Washington Post” and others, who give us both hard times when called for on facts, have said that this is absolutely an incorrect false charge. So, we both have relatively small amounts of contributions from people who work for fossil fuel companies. Best we can tell from the reports that are done. But, that is not being supported by big oil, and I think it’s important to distinguish that. And, let’s talk about what each of us has proposed to try to combat greenhouse gas emissions and put us on the fastest track possible to clean energy. BLITZER: Thank you. We’re going to get to that to, but I want you to respond, Senator. SANDERS: It is one thing, as the Secretary indicated, to talk about workers. I’m sure I have contributions, you have contributions from workers in every industry in the country. But, as I understand it, 43 lobbyists for the fossil fuel industry maxed out, gave the maximum amount of money to Secretary Clinton’s campaign. (APPLAUSE) SANDERS: Now, that’s not saying — and, then some people say, well, given the hundreds of millions of dollars she raises it’s a small amount. That’s true. But, that does not mean to say that the lobbyists thought she was a pretty good bet on this issue. Now, what I think is when we look at climate change now, we have got to realize that this is a global environmental crisis of unprecedented urgency. (APPLAUSE) (CHEERING) And, it is not good enough. You know, if we, God forbid, were attacked tomorrow the whole country would rise up and say we got an enemy out there and we got to do something about it. That was what 9/11 was about. We have an enemy out there, and that enemy is going to cause drought and floods and extreme weather disturbances. There’s going to be international conflict. (APPLAUSE) I am proud, Wolf, that I have introduced the most comprehensive climate change legislation... BLITZER: .... Thank you... SANDERS: ... Including a tax on carbon. Something I don’t believe Secretary Clinton supports. (APPLAUSE) (CHEERING) BLITZER: Secretary Clinton, go ahead and respond. CLINTON: Well, let’s talk about the global environmental crisis. Starting in 2009 as your Secretary of State, I worked with President Obama to bring China and India to the table for the very first time, to get a commitment out of them that they would begin to address their own greenhouse gas emissions. (APPLAUSE) I continued to work on that throughout the four years as Secretary of State, and I was very proud that President Obama and America led the way to the agreement that was finally reached in Paris with 195 nations committing to take steps to actually make a difference in climate change. (APPLAUSE) And, I was surprised and disappointed when Senator Sanders attacked the agreement, said it was not enough, it didn’t go far enough. You know, at some point putting together 195 countries, I know a little bit about that, was a major accomplishment... BLITZER: ... Thank you... (APPLAUSE CHEERING) CLINTON: ... And, our President led the effort to protect our world and he deserve our appreciation, not our criticism... BLITZER: ... Go ahead, Senator... SANDERS: ... Let’s talk about that. When you were Secretary of State, you also worked hard to expand fracking to countries all over the world. (CHEERING) SANDERS: The issue here — of course the agreement is a step forward, but you know agreements and I know agreements, there’s a lot of paper there. We’ve got to get beyond paper right now. We have got to lead the world in transforming our energy system, not tomorrow, but yesterday. (APPLAUSE) And, what that means, Wolf, it means having the guts to take on the fossil fuel industry. Now, I am on board legislation that says, you know what, we ain’t going to excavate for fossil fuel on public land. That’s not Secretary Clinton’s position. BLITZER: Thank you. Let us support a tax on carbon... BLITZER: ... Secretary Clinton... SANDERS: ... Not Secretary Clinton’s position. BLITZER: ... Go ahead and respond. (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: Well, I’m a little bewildered about how to respond when you have an agreement which gives you the framework to actually take the action that would have only come about because under the Obama administration in the face of implacable hostility from the Republicans in Congress, President Obama moved forward on gas mileage, he moved forward on the clean power plant. He has moved forward on so many of the fronts that he could given the executive actions that he was able to take. (APPLAUSE) And, you know, I am getting a little bit — I’m getting a little bit concerned here because, you know, I really believe that the President has done an incredible job against great odds and deserves to be supported. (APPLAUSE) (CHEERING) CLINTON: Now, it’s easy — it’s easy to diagnose the problem. It’s harder to do something about the problem. And... (APPLAUSE) BLITZER: Thank you, Secretary. We’ll continue on this. Errol — Errol Louis, go ahead with your question. SANDERS: Wolf. Wolf. BLITZER: We’re going to continue on this. Errol, go ahead. LOUIS: OK. Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, you also pioneered a program to promote fracking around the world, as you described. Fracking, of course, a way of extracting natural gas. Now as a candidate for president, you say that by the time you’re done with all your rules and regulations, fracking will be restricted in many places around the country. Why have you changed your view on fracking? CLINTON: No, well, I don’t think I’ve changed my view on what we need to do to go from where we are, where the world is heavily dependent on coal and oil, but principally coal, to where we need to be, which is clean renewable energy, and one of the bridge fuels is natural gas. And so for both economic and environmental and strategic reasons, it was American policy to try to help countries get out from under the constant use of coal, building coal plants all the time, also to get out from under, especially if they were in Europe, the pressure from Russia, which has been incredibly intense. So we did say natural gas is a bridge. We want to cross that bridge as quickly as possible, because in order to deal with climate change, we have got to move as rapidly as we can. That’s why I’ve set big goals. I want to see us deploy a half a billion more solar panels by the end of my first term and enough clean energy to provide electricity to every home in America within 10 years. (APPLAUSE) So I have big, bold goals, but I know in order to get from where we are, where the world is still burning way too much coal, where the world is still too intimidated by countries and providers like Russia, we have got to make a very firm but decisive move in the direction of clean energy. LOUIS: Thank you, Secretary. All right, Senator? SANDERS: All right, here is — here is a real difference. This is a difference between understanding that we have a crisis of historical consequence here, and incrementalism and those little steps are not enough. (APPLAUSE) Not right now. Not on climate change. Now, the truth is, as secretary of state, Secretary Clinton actively supported fracking technology around the world. Second of all, right now, we have got to tell the fossil fuel industry that their short-term profits are not more important than the future of this planet. (APPLAUSE) And that means — and I would ask you to respond. Are you in favor of a tax on carbon so that we can transit away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy at the level and speed we need to do? (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: You know, I have laid out a set of actions that build on what President Obama was able to accomplish, building on the clean power plan, which is currently under attack by fossil fuels and the right in the Supreme Court, which is one of the reasons why we need to get the Supreme Court justice that President Obama has nominated to be confirmed so that we can actually continue to make progress. I don’t take a back seat to your legislation that you’ve introduced that you haven’t been able to get passed. I want to do what we can do to actually make progress in dealing with the crisis. That’s exactly what I have proposed. LOUIS: OK, thank you, Secretary Clinton. CLINTON: And my approach I think is going to get us there faster without tying us up into political knots with a Congress that still would not support what you are proposing. (CROSSTALK) LOUIS: Senator Sanders, you’ve said that climate change is the greatest change to our nation’s security. SANDERS: Secretary Clinton did not answer one simple question. LOUIS: Excuse me, Senator, Senator, Senator, Senator, Senator... SANDERS: Are you for a tax on carbon or not? LOUIS: I have a question for you. You’ve said that climate change is the greatest threat to our nation’s security. You’ve called for a nationwide ban on fracking. You’ve also called for phasing out all nuclear power in the U.S. But wouldn’t those proposals drive the country back to coal and oil, and actually undermine your fight against global warming? SANDERS: No, they wouldn’t. Look, here’s where we are. Let me reiterate. We have a global crisis. Pope Francis reminded us that we are on a suicide course. Our legislation understands, Errol, that there will be economic dislocation. It is absolutely true. There will be some people who lose their job. And we build into our legislation an enormous amount of money to protect those workers. It is not their fault... SANDERS: It is not their fault that fossil fuels are destroying our climate. But we have got to stand up and say right now, as we would if we were attacked by some military force, we have got to move urgency — urgently and boldly. What does that mean? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Senator — senator, jobs... SANDERS: Yes? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: — jobs are one thing, but with less than 6 percent of all U.S. energy coming from solar, wind and geothermal, and 20 percent of U.S. power coming from nuclear, if you phase out all of that, how do you make up... SANDERS: Well, you don’t phase... UNIDENTIFIED MALE: — that difference? SANDERS: — it all out tomorrow. And you certainly don’t phase nuclear out tomorrow. But this is what you do do. (APPLAUSE) SANDERS: What you do do is say that we are going to have a massive program — and I had introduced — introduced legislation for 10 million solar rooftops. We can put probably millions of people to work retrofitting and weatherizing buildings all over this country. (CHEERING) SANDERS: Saving — rebuilding our rail system. (APPLAUSE) SANDERS: Our mass transit system. (APPLAUSE) SANDERS: If we approach this, Errol, as if we were literally at a war — you know, in 1941, under Franklin Delano Roosevelt, we moved within three years, within three more years to rebuild our economy to defeat Nazism and Japanese imperialism. That is exactly the kind of approach we need right now. BLITZER: Thank you. (APPLAUSE) SANDERS: Lead the world. BLITZER: Thank you, Senator. (APPLAUSE) BLITZER: Let’s turn to another critically important issue... (APPLAUSE) BLITZER: — the issue of national security and foreign policy. Secretary Clinton, President Obama says the worst mistake in office that he made over these past seven and a half years was not preparing for Libya after Moammar Qadafi was removed. You were his secretary of State. Aren’t you also responsible for that? CLINTON: Well, let me say I think we did a great deal to help the Libyan people after Qadafi’s demise. And here’s what we did. We helped them hold two successful elections, something that is not easy, which they did very well because they had a pent up desire to try to chart their own future after 42 years of dictatorship. I was very proud of that. We got rid of the chemical weapons stockpile that Qadafi had, getting it out of Libya, getting it away from militias or terrorist groups. We also worked to help them set up their government. We sent a lot of American experts there. We offered to help them secure their borders, to train a new military. They, at the end, when it came to security issues, Wolf, did not want troops from any other country, not just us, European or other countries, in Libya. And so we were caught in a very difficult position. They could not provide security on their own, which we could see and we told them that, but they didn’t want to have others helping to provide that security. And the result has been a clash between different parts of the country, terrorists taking up some locations in the country. And we can’t walk away from that. We need to be working with European and Arab partners... BLITZER: Thank you. CLINTON: — with the United Nations in order to continue to try to support them. The Libyan people deserve a chance at democracy and self- government. And I, as president, will keep trying to give that to them BLITZER: Senator, go ahead. SANDERS: According to “The New York Times.”.. (APPLAUSE) SANDERS: — for President Obama, this was a pretty tough call, like a 51-49 call, do you overthrow Qadafi, who, of course, was a horrific dictator? “The New York Times” told us it was Secretary Clinton who led the effect for that regime change. And this is the same type of mentality that supported the war in Iraq. (APPLAUSE) SANDERS: Look... (APPLAUSE) SANDERS: — Qadafi, Saddam Hussein are brutal, brutal murdering thugs. No debate about that. But what we have got to do and what the president was saying is we didn’t think thoroughly about what happens the day after you get rid of these dictators. Regime change often has unintended consequences in Iraq and in Libya right now, where ISIS has a very dangerous foothold. And I think if you studied the whole history of... BLITZER: Yes. SANDERS: — American involvement in regime change, you see that quite often. BLITZER: Secretary, we’re going to let you respond. (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: Yes, well, I... (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: — I... (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: — I — I would just point out that there was a vote in the Senate as to whether or not the United States should support the efforts by the Libyan people to protect themselves against the threats, the genocidal threats coming from Gadhafi, and whether we should go to the United Nations to seek Security Council support. Senator sanders voted for that, and that’s exactly what we did. SANDERS: No. (CROSSTALK) CLINTON: We went to the United Nations — yes, he did. We went to the United Nations Security Council. We got support from the Security Council. And we then supported the efforts of our European and Arab allies and partners. This was a request made to our government by the Europeans and by the Arabs because of their great fear of what chaos in Syria would do to them. And if you want to know what chaos does, not just to the people inside but the people on the borders, look at Syria. Nobody stood up to Assad and removed him, and we have had a far greater disaster in Syria than we are currently dealing with right now in Libya. (APPLAUSE) (CROSSTALK) BLITZER: Senator, go ahead. SANDERS: Secretary Clinton made this charge in previous debates and just repeating it doesn’t make it truer. What you are talking about is what I think was what they call the unanimous consent, you know what that is, where basically, do we support Libya moving to democracy? Well, you know what, I surely have always supported Libya moving to democracy. But please do not confuse that with your active effort for regime change without contemplating what happened the day after. Totally different issue. CLINTON: Well, that isn’t... SANDERS: Second of all — second of all, if I might, in terms of Syria, in terms of Syria... BLITZER: Senator, let her respond to that, then we’ll get to that. Go ahead, Secretary. CLINTON: There was also in that a reference to the Security Council, and I know you’re not shy when you oppose something, Senator. So, yes, it was unanimous. That’s exactly right, including you. And what we did was to try to provide support for our European and Arab allies and partners. The decision was the president’s. Did I do the due diligence? Did I talk to everybody I could talk to? Did I visit every capital and then report back to the president? Yes, I did. That’s what a secretary of state does. But at the end of the day, those are the decisions that are made by the president to in any way use American military power. And the president made that decision. And, yes, we did try without success because of the Libyans’ obstruction to our efforts, but we did try and we will continue to try to help the Libyan people. BLITZER: Thank you, Secretary. Go ahead, Senator. SANDERS: If you listen, you know — two points. Number one, yes, 100-0 in the Senate voted for democracy in Libya and I would vote for that again. But that is very different from getting actively involved to overthrow and bring about regime change without fully understanding what the consequence of that regime change would be. Second of all, I know you keep referring to Barack Obama all night here, but you in Syria, you in Syria talked about a no-fly zone, which the president certainly does not support, nor do I support because, A, it will cost an enormous sum of money, second of all, it runs the risk of getting us sucked into perpetual warfare in that region. Thirdly, when we talk about Syria right now, no debate, like Gadhafi, like Saddam Hussein, Assad is another brutal murdering dictator, but right now our fight is to destroy ISIS first, and to get rid of Assad second. CLINTON: Well, I think Senator Sanders has just reinforced my point. Yes, when I was secretary of state I did urge, along with the Department of Defense and the CIA that we seek out, vet, and train, and arm Syrian opposition figures so that they could defend themselves against Assad. The president said no. Now, that’s how it works. People who work for the president make recommendations and then the president makes the decision. So I think it’s only fair to look at where we are in Syria today. And, yes, I do still support a no-fly zone because I think we need to put in safe havens for those poor Syrians who are fleeing both Assad and ISIS and have some place that they can be safe. BLITZER: Staying on national security, Dana Bash has a question. BASH: Senator Sanders, in 1997, you said this about NATO, you said, quote: “It is not the time to continue wasting tens of billions of dollars helping to defend Europe, let alone assuming more than our share of any cost associated with expanding NATO.” Do you still feel that way? SANDERS: Well, what I believe, if my memory is correct here, we spend about 75 percent of the entire cost of the military aspect of NATO. Given the fact that France has a very good health care system and free public education, college education for their people, the U.K. has a good National Health Service and they also provide fairly reasonable higher education, you know what, yeah, I do believe that the countries of Europe should pick up more of the burden for their defense. Yes, I do. (APPLAUSE) BASH: And just following up, Senator Sanders, Donald Trump also argues that NATO is unfair economically to the U.S. because America pays a disproportionate share. So how is what you say about NATO and your proposal different than his? SANDERS: Well, you got to ask — you got to ask Trump. All I can tell you is, with a huge deficit, with 47 million people living in poverty, with our inner cities collapsing, yeah, I do think countries like Germany and U.K. and France and European countries whose economy, or at least its standard of living and health care and education, they’re doing pretty well. So I would not be embarrassed as president of the United States to stay to our European allies, you know what, the United States of America cannot just support your economies. You got to put up your own fair share of the defense burden. Nothing wrong with that. (APPLAUSE) BASH: Secretary Clinton? CLINTON: I support our continuing involvement in NATO. And it is important to ask for our NATO allies to pay more of the cost. There is a requirement that they should be doing so, and I believe that needs to be enforced. But there’s a larger question here. NATO has been the most successful military alliance in probably human history. It has bound together across the Atlantic countries that are democracies, that have many of the same values and interests, and now we need to modernize it and move it into the 21st century to serve as that head of our defense operations in Europe when it comes to terrorism and other threats that we face. So... BASH: But, Madam Secretary... CLINTON: ... yes, of course they should be paying more, but that doesn’t mean if they don’t we leave, because I don’t think that’s in America’s interests. BASH: That’s going to be part of my — my question to you is, to that point, there are 28 countries in the alliance, and the United States gives more money to NATO’s budget than 21 of those countries combined. If they don’t agree to pay more, as you suggested, then what would you do as commander-in-chief? CLINTON: I will stay in NATO. I will stay in NATO, and we will continue to look for missions and other kinds of programs that they will support. Remember, NATO was with us in Afghanistan. Most of the member countries also lost soldiers and civilians in Afghanistan. They came to our rallying defense after 9/11. That meant a lot. And, yes, we have to work out the financial aspects of it, but let’s not forget what’s really happening. With Russia being more aggressive, making all kinds of intimidating moves toward the Baltic countries, we’ve seen what they’ve done in Eastern Ukraine, we know how they want to rewrite the map of Europe, it is not in our interests. Think of how much it would cost if Russia’s aggression were not deterred because NATO was there on the front lines making it clear they could not move forward. (APPLAUSE) BLITZER: Thank you, Secretary. Senator, let’s talk about the U.S. relationship with Israel. Senator Sanders, you maintained that Israel’s response in Gaza in 2014 was, quote, “disproportionate and led to the unnecessary loss of innocent life.” (APPLAUSE) What do you say to those who believe that Israel has a right to defend itself as it sees fit? SANDERS: Well, as somebody who spent many months of my life when I was a kid in Israel, who has family in Israel, of course Israel has a right not only to defend themselves, but to live in peace and security without fear of terrorist attack. That is not a debate. (APPLAUSE) But — but what you just read, yeah, I do believe that. Israel was subjected to terrorist attacks, has every right in the world to destroy terrorism. But we had in the Gaza area — not a very large area — some 10,000 civilians who were wounded and some 1,500 who were killed. AUDIENCE MEMBER: Free Palestine! SANDERS: Now, if you’re asking not just me, but countries all over the world was that a disproportionate attack, the answer is that I believe it was, and let me say something else. (APPLAUSE) (CHEERING) SANDERS: And, let me say something else. As somebody who is 100% pro-Israel, in the long run — and this is not going to be easy, God only knows, but in the long run if we are ever going to bring peace to that region which has seen so much hatred and so much war, we are going to have to treat the Palestinian people with respect and dignity. (APPLAUSE) (CHEERING) SANDERS: So what is not to say — to say that right now in Gaza, right now in Gaza unemployment is s somewhere around 40%. You got a log of that area continues, it hasn’t been built, decimated, houses decimated health care decimated, schools decimated. I believe the United States and the rest of the world have got to work together to help the Palestinian people. That does not make me anti-Israel. That paves the way, I think... BLITZER: ... Thank you, Senator... SANDERS: ...to an approach that works in the Middle East. (APPLAUSE) (CHEERING) BLITZER: Thank you. Secretary Clinton, do you agree with Senator Sanders that Israel overreacts to Palestinians attacks, and that in order for there to be peace between Israel and the Palestinians, Israel must, quote, end its disproportionate responses? An interactive delegate calculator that lets you simulate how the 2016 Republican nomination process could unfold. CLINTON: I negotiated the cease-fire between Israel and Hamas in November of 2012. I did it in concert with... (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: President Abbas of the Palestinian authority based in Ramallah, I did it with the then Muslim Brotherhood President, Morsi, based in Cairo, working closely with Prime Minister Netanyahu and the Israeli cabinet. I can tell you right now I have been there with Israeli officials going back more than 25 years that they do not seek this kind of attacks. They do not invite the rockets raining down on their towns and villages. (APPLAUSE) They do not believe that there should be a constant incitement by Hamas aided and abetted by Iran against Israel. And, so when it came time after they had taken the incoming rockets, taken the assaults and ambushes on their soldiers and they called and told me, I was in Cambodia, that they were getting ready to have to invade Gaza again because they couldn’t find anybody to talk to tell them to stop it, I flew all night, I got there, I negotiated that. So, I don’t know how you run a country when you are under constant threat, terrorist tact, rockets coming at you. You have a right to defend yourself. (APPLAUSE) That does not mean — that does not mean that you don’t take appropriate precautions. And, I understand that there’s always second guessing anytime there is a war. It also does not mean that we should not continue to do everything we can to try to reach a two-state solution, which would give the Palestinians the rights and... BLITZER: ... Thank you... CLINTON: ... just let me finish. The rights and the autonomy that they deserve. And, let me say this, if Yasser Arafat had agreed with my husband at Camp David in the Late 1990s to the offer then Prime Minister Barat put on the table, we would have had a Palestinian state for 15 years. (APPLAUSE) (CHEERING) BLITZER: Thank you, Senator, go ahead — go ahead, Senator. SANDERS: I don’t think that anybody would suggest that Israel invites and welcomes missiles flying into their country. That is not the issue. And, you evaded the answer. You evaded the question. The question is not does Israel have a right to respond, nor does Israel have a right to go after terrorists and destroy terrorism. That’s not the debate. Was their response disproportionate? I believe that it was, you have not answered that. (CHEERING) CLINTON: I will certainly be willing to answer it. I think I did answer it by saying that of course there have to be precautions taken but even the most independent analyst will say the way that Hamas places its weapons, the way that it often has its fighters in civilian garb, it is terrible. (AUDIENCE REACTION) I’m not saying it’s anything other than terrible. It would be great — remember, Israel left Gaza. They took out all the Israelis. They turned the keys over to the Palestinian people. CLINTON: And what happened? Hamas took over Gaza. So instead of having a thriving economy with the kind of opportunities that the children of the Palestinians deserve, we have a terrorist haven that is getting more and more rockets shipped in from Iran and elsewhere. BLITZER: Thank you, Secretary. Senator. SANDERS: I read Secretary Clinton’s statement speech before AIPAC. I heard virtually no discussion at all about the needs of the Palestinian people. Almost none in that speech. (APPLAUSE) SANDERS: So here is the issue: of course Israel has a right to defend itself, but long term there will never be peace in that region unless the United States plays a role, an even-handed role trying to bring people together and recognizing the serious problems that exist among the Palestinian people. That is what I believe the world wants to us do and that’s the kind of leadership that we have got to exercise. CLINTON: Well, if I — I want to add, you know, again describing the problem is a lot easier than trying to solve it. And I have been involved, both as first lady with my husband’s efforts, as a senator supporting the efforts that even the Bush administration was undertaking, and as secretary of state for President Obama, I’m the person who held the last three meetings between the president of the Palestinian Authority and the prime minister of Israel. There were only four of us in the room, Netanyahu, Abbas, George Mitchell, and me. Three long meetings. And I was absolutely focused on what was fair and right for the Palestinians. I was absolutely focused on what we needed to do to make sure that the Palestinian people had the right to self-government. And I believe that as president I will be able to continue to make progress and get an agreement that will be fair both to the Israelis and the Palestinians without ever, ever undermining Israel’s security. (APPLAUSE) BLITZER: A final word, Senator, go ahead. SANDERS: There comes a time — there comes a time when if we pursue justice and peace, we are going to have to say that Netanyahu is not right all of the time. (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: Well... BLITZER: Secretary. CLINTON: ... you know, I have spoken about and written at some length the very candid conversations I’ve had with him and other Israeli leaders. Nobody is saying that any individual leader is always right, but it is a difficult position. If you are from whatever perspective trying to seek peace, trying to create the conditions for peace when there is a terrorist group embedded in Gaza that does not want to see you exist, that is a very difficult challenge. BLITZER: Senator, go ahead. SANDERS: You gave a major speech to AIPAC, which obviously deals with the Middle East crisis, and you barely mentioned the Palestinians. And I think, again, it is a complicated issue and God knows for decades presidents, including President Clinton and others, Jimmy Carter and others have tried to do the right thing. All that I am saying is we cannot continue to be one-sided. There are two sides to the issue. BLITZER: Thank you, Senator. Thank you, Secretary. We have to take another quick, quick break. But much more on the CNN Democratic presidential debate live from Brooklyn, New York. That is coming up right after this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BLITZER: Welcome back to the CNN presidential debate. We’re here in Brooklyn. Secretary, Senator, both of you talk about major reforms to college tuition, health care, and Social Security, all of which will take significant changes from Congress, currently controlled by Republicans. Senator Sanders, you’re promising health care and free college for all, and those plans would be met with both political and practical challenges. The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says your initiatives would cost up to $28 trillion and, even after massive tax increases, that would add as much as $15 trillion to the national debt. How is this fiscally responsible? SANDERS: Well, first of all, I disagree with that study. There are many economists who come up with very, very different numbers. For example, we are the only country, major country on Earth, that does not guarantee health care to all people, and yet we end up spending almost three times what the British do, 50 percent more than the French. My proposal, a Medicare-for-all, single-payer program, will save... (APPLAUSE) ... will save middle-class families many thousands of dollars a year in their health care costs. Public colleges and universities tuition free? Damn right. That is exactly what we should be doing. (APPLAUSE) SANDERS: And I’d pay for that — I’d pay for that by telling Wall Street that, yeah, we are going to have a tax on Wall Street speculation, which will bring in more than enough money to provide free tuition at public colleges and universities and lower the outrageous level of student debt. Wolf, we have seen in the last 30 years a massive transfer of wealth from the middle class to the top 0.1 percent. The establishment does not like this idea, but, yes, I am determined to transfer that money back to the working families of this country. (APPLAUSE) BLITZER: Thank you, Senator. Secretary, go ahead and respond. CLINTON: Well, again — again, I absolutely agree with the diagnosis, the diagnosis that we’ve got to do much more to finish the work of getting universal health care coverage, something that I’ve worked on for 25 years. Before there was something called Obamacare, there was something called Hillarycare. And we’re now at 90 percent of coverage; I’m going to get us to 100 percent. And with respect to college, I think we have to make college affordable. We are pricing out middle-class, working, and poor families. There’s no doubt about that. But I do think when you make proposals and you’re running for president, you should be held accountable for whether or not the numbers add up and whether or not the plans... (APPLAUSE) ... are actually going to work. And just very briefly, on health care, most of the people who have analyzed what Senator Sanders put out — remember, he had a plan for about, I don’t know, 18, 20 years. He changed in the middle of this campaign. He put out another plan. People have been analyzing the new plan. And there is no doubt by those who have analyzed it, progressive economists, health economists, and the like, that it would pose an incredible burden, not just on the budget, but on individuals. In fact, the Washington Post called it a train-wreck for the poor. A working woman on Medicaid who already has health insurance would be expected to pay about $2,300. The same for free college. The free college offer — you know, my late father said, if somebody promises you something for free, read the fine print. You read the fine print, and here’s what it says. BLITZER: Thank you, Secretary. CLINTON: The fine print says this, that it will — the federal government will cover two-thirds of the cost and require the states, even those led by Republican governors... BLITZER: Senator, go ahead. Thank you. CLINTON: ... to carry out what the remaining one-third of the cost. SANDERS: I know what Secretary Clinton is saying. BLITZER: Secretary please. SANDERS: We are not a country that has the courage to stand up to big money and do what has to be done for the working families of the country. (APPLAUSE) Secretary Clinton will have to explain to the people of our country how it could be that every other major country on Earth manages to guarantee health care to all of their people, spending significantly less per capita than we can. I live 50 miles away from Canada, you know? It’s not some kind of communist authoritarian country. They’re doing OK. They got a health care system that guarantees health care to all people. We can do the same. In terms of public colleges and universities, please don’t tell me that we cannot do what many other countries around the world are doing. Kids should not be punished and leave school deeply in debt, for what crime? For trying to get an education. BLITZER: Thank you, Senator. SANDERS: So, yes, we are going to pay for it... CLINTON: Well... BLITZER: Secretary Clinton — Secretary Clinton, go ahead. CLINTON: We have — we have a difference of opinion. We both want to get to universal health care coverage. I did stand up to the special interests and the powerful forces, the health insurance companies and the drug companies. (APPLAUSE) And perhaps that’s why I am so much in favor of supporting President Obama’s signature accomplishment with the Affordable Care Act, because I know how hard it was to get that passed, even with a Democratic Congress. So rather than letting the Republicans repeal it or rather starting all over again, trying to throw the country into another really contentious debate, let’s make the Affordable Care Act work for everybody... BLITZER: Thank you, Secretary. CLINTON: ... let’s get to 100 percent coverage, let’s get the cost down, and let’s guarantee health care. BLITZER: Secretary, let’s talk about Social Security, another critically important issue. Senator Sanders has challenged you to give a clear answer when it comes to extending the life of Social Security and expanding benefits. Are you prepared to lift the cap on taxable income, which currently stands at $118,500? Yes or no, would you lift the cap? CLINTON: I have said repeatedly, Wolf, I am going to make the wealthy pay into Social Security to extend the Social Security Trust Fund. That is one way. If that is the way that we pursue, I will follow that. CLINTON: But there are other ways. We should be looking at taxing passive income by wealthy people. We should be looking at taxing all of their investment. But here’s the real issue, because I — I’ve heard this, I’ve seen the reports of it. I have said from the very beginning, we are going to protect Social Security. I was one of the leaders in the fight against Bush when he was trying to privatize Social Security. But we also, in addition to extending the Trust Fund, which I am absolutely determined to do, we’ve got to help people who are not being taken care of now. And because Social Security started in the 1930s, a lot of women have been left out and left behind. And it’s time that we provide more benefits for widows, divorcees, for caregivers, for women who deserve more from the Social Security... BLITZER: Thank you, Secretary. CLINTON: — system and that will be my highest priority. BLITZER: Senator? Go ahead, Senator. (APPLAUSE) SANDERS: An interesting comment, but you didn’t answer the question. CLINTON: I did. If that’s the way we’re... SANDERS: No, you didn’t. My legi... CLINTON: — yes, I did. SANDERS: Can I answer... CLINTON: I did answer the... SANDERS: — may I please... CLINTON: Well, don’t — don’t put words... SANDERS: — can I have... (CROSSTALK) CLINTON: — into my mouth and say something... SANDERS: — do I not? CLINTON: — that’s not accurate. BLITZER: Go ahead, Senator. SANDERS: All right. Essentially what you described is my legislation, which includes (INAUDIBLE)... (APPLAUSE) SANDERS: Now, we’ve got — here is the issue. Your answer has been the same year after year. In fact, the idea that I’m bringing forth, I have to admit it, you know, it wasn’t my idea. It was Barack Obama’s idea in 2008, the exact same idea. (APPLAUSE) SANDERS: He called for lifting the cap, which is now higher — it’s at 118 — and starting at 250 and going on up. If you do that, you’re going to extend the life of Social Security for 58 years. You will significantly expand benefits by 1,300 bucks a year for seniors and disabled vets under $16,000 a year. What’s wrong with that? Are you prepared to support it? CLINTON: I have supported it. You know, we are in vigorous agreement here, Senator. SANDERS: You have sup... CLINTON: I think it’s important... (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: — to point out that... (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: — you know, we’re — we’re having a discussion about the best way to raise money from wealthy people to extend the Social Security Trust Fund. Think about what the other side wants to do. They’re calling Social Security a Ponzi scheme. They still want to privatize it. In fact, their whole idea is to turn over the Social Security Trust Fund to Wall Street, something you and I would never let happen. SANDERS: All right, so... CLINTON: So, yes, we both want to make sure... (APPLAUSE) SANDERS: Look, Wolf... CLINTON: — Social Security (INAUDIBLE)... SANDERS: — I am very glad that... (CROSSTALK) CLINTON: — and well-funded... SANDERS: I am very glad to... (CROSSTALK) BLITZER: Thank you, Secretary. (CROSSTALK) BLITZER: Senator, go ahead. SANDERS: — campaign of challenging, if I hear you correctly, Madam Secretary, you are now coming out finally in favor of lifting the cap on taxable income... (APPLAUSE) SANDERS: — and extending and expanding Social Security. If that is the case, welcome on board. I’m glad you’re here. (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: No. BLITZER: Thank you. Errol — Errol Louis, go ahead. (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: We are going... (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: — we are... (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: — we are going... LOUIS: Secretary... CLINTON: I — as he said, I’ve said the same thing for years. I didn’t say anything different tonight. We are going to extend the Social Security Trust Fund. There is still something called Congress. Now, I happen to support Democrats and I want to get Democrats to take back the majority in the United States Senate... BLITZER: Errol... CLINTON: — so a lot of — a lot of what we’re talking about can actually be implemented... BLITZER: Errol, hold on a second. CLINTON: — when I am president. LOUIS: Secretary... BLITZER: Go ahead. Hold on, Errol... SANDERS: — I’m still... BLITZER: — Errol. Hold on. SANDERS: I’ve got to admit... BLITZER: Go ahead, Senator. SANDERS: — maybe I’m a little bit confused. Are you or are you not supporting legislation to lift the cap on taxable income and expand Social Security for 58 years and increase benefits... CLINTON: I am... SANDERS: — yes or no? CLINTON: I have said yes, we are going to pick the best way or combination... SANDERS: Oh, you — ah. (APPLAUSE) (BOOS) SANDERS: OK. CLINTON: — or combination of ways... (BOOS) CLINTON: — you know... (BOOS) CLINTON: — it — it’s all — it’s always a little bit, uh, challenging because, you know, if Senator Sanders doesn’t agree with how you are approaching something, then you are a member of the establishment. Well, let me say then... SANDERS: Well, look... (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: — let me say this... (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: — we are going to extend the Social Security Trust Fund. We’ve got some good ideas to do it. Let’s get a Congress elected... BLITZER: Thank you. CLINTON: — that will actually agree... BLITZER: Well, thank you... CLINTON: — with us in doing it. BLITZER: Errol, go ahead. LOUIS: OK, Secretary Clinton, I’ve got a question for you from a reader... (CROSSTALK) SANDERS: Let me interject here. LOUIS: — of the “New York Daily News.” SANDERS: Yes, Secretary Clinton... (CROSSTALK) SANDERS: — you are a member of the establishment. LOUIS: — this was a reader... SANDERS: (INAUDIBLE). LOUIS: — of “The Daily News” who sent us a... (CHEERING) LOUIS: — a question for you. LOUIS: Just a second, Senator. Hannah Green (ph) wants to know your position, Secretary Clinton, regarding President Obama’s nomination of Merrick Gaarland to the Supreme m Court. President Obama said earlier this week that he would not withdraw the nomination, even after the presidential election. If elected, would you ask the president to withdraw the nomination? CLINTON: I am not going to contradict the president’s strategy on this. And I’m not going to engage in hypotheticals. I fully support the president. (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: And I believe that the president — the president is on the right side of both the Constitution and history. And the Senate needs to immediately begin to respond. So I’m going to support the president. When I am president, I will take stock of where we are and move from there. LOUIS: Senator Sanders. SANDERS: Well, there is no question. I mean, it really is an outrage. And it just continues, the seven-and-a-half years of unbelievable obstructionism we have seen from these right-wing Republicans. I mean, a third-grader in America understands the president of the United States has the right to nominate individuals to the U.S. Supreme Court. Apparently everybody understands that except the Republicans in Congress. LOUIS: So, Senator Sanders, would you ask him to withdraw the nomination? SANDERS: Yes, but here is the point, and obviously i will strongly support that nomination as a member of the Senate. But, if elected president, I would ask the president to withdraw that nomination because I think — I think this. I think that we need a Supreme Court justice who will make it crystal clear, and this nominee has not yet done that, crystal clear that he or she will vote to overturn Citizens United and make sure that American democracy is not undermined. (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: You know, there is no doubt that the only people that I would ever appoint to the Supreme Court are people who believe that Roe V. Wade is settled law and Citizens United needs to be overturned. And I want to say something about this since we’re talking about the Supreme Court and what’s at stake. We’ve had eight debates before, this is our ninth. We’ve not had one question about a woman’s right to make her own decisions about reproductive health care, not one question. (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: And in the meantime we have states, governors doing everything they can to restrict women’s rights. We have a presidential candidate by the name of Donald Trump saying that women should be punished. And we are never asked about this. And to be complete in my concern, Senator Sanders says with respect to Trump it was a distraction. I don’t think it’s a distraction. It goes to the heart of who we are as women, our rights, our autonomy, our ability to make our own decisions, and we need to be talking about that and defending Planned Parenthood from these outrageous attacks. BASH: Senator Sanders, your response. SANDERS: You’re looking at a senator and former congressman who proudly has a 100 percent pro-choice voting record, who will take on those Republican governors who are trying to restrict a woman’s right to choose, who will take on those governors right now who are discriminating outrageously against the LGBT community, who comes from a state which led the effort for gay marriage in this country, proudly so. (APPLAUSE) BASH: Thank you, Senator. SANDERS: Who not only thinks we are not going to — not defund Planned Parenthood, we’ve got to expand funding for Planned Parenthood. (APPLAUSE) BASH: Senator Sanders, you’ve spoken a lot tonight about your votes in Congress. You have been in Congress for over a quarter of the century, and there as an independent, not a Democrat. Now you’re seeking the Democratic nomination, but Secretary Clinton has suggested that she’s not even sure you are a Democrat. Are you? SANDERS: Well, why would I be running for the Democratic nomination to be president of the United States? (APPLAUSE) SANDERS: But here is a good point. You know, in virtually all of the general election match-up polls between Trump and Secretary Clinton and Trump and Bernie Sanders, in almost all of those polls, I do better than Secretary Clinton both in the CNN poll I was 20 points ahead of Trump. I think Secretary Clinton was 12 points. And you know why? Because in fact a whole lot of people — this may be a shock to the secretary, but there a whole lot of independents in this country. (APPLAUSE) BASH: Senator Sanders... SANDERS: And we are not going to win the White House based on just long-term Democratic votes. We have got to reach out to independents and I think I am well qualified to do that. BASH: Senator Sanders. (APPLAUSE) SANDERS: I am in this race as a Democrat. I have raised millions of dollars for my colleagues in the United States Senate to help them get elected. I will do everything I can to open the Democratic party to the young people who are flocking into our political campaign. (CHEERING) BASH: On that very subject, on that very subject, Secretary Clinton mentions electing a Democratic congress several times. She says that she raised $15 million for the Democratic party in the first three months of this year. You don’t appear to have raised any money for the party. Yesterday you did announce that you will help three members of Congress who have endorsed you. Why aren’t you doing more to help the party you say you want to lead? SANDERS: The truth is, and you can speak to my colleagues, we have raised millions of dollars to the DSCC. I have written letter that have raised, if I may use the word, huge amount of money so that’s just not accurate. But, I will also say, and this is important and maybe the Secretary disagrees with me, but I am proud that millions of young people who previously were not involved in the political process are now coming into it, and I do believe, I do believe that we have got to open the door of the Democratic party to those people. (APPLAUSE) And, I think the future of the Democratic party is not simply by raising money from wealthy campaign contributors. I think that the way we are doing it in this campaign... BASH: ... Thank you Senator. SANDERS: $27 a contribution... BASH: ... Senator, your time is up... SANDERS; not being dependent on Wall Street, or big money, that is the future of the Democratic Party that I want to see. (APPLAUSE) (CHEERING) BASH: Thank you, Senator Sanders. Secretary Clinton. CLINTON: Let us talk about where we are in this race. I’ve gotten more votes than anybody running. 9.6 million at the last count. (APPLAUSE) (CHEERING) That is 2.3 million more than Senator Sanders. (APPLAUSE) And it is 1.4 million more than Donald Trump. (APPLAUSE) (CHEERING) I think you have to look at the facts. And, the facts are that I’m putting together a very broad-based, inclusive coalition from the South to the North, from the East to the West, with African-American, Latinos, women, union households, working people and I am very proud of the campaign we are running. It is a campaign that will not only capture the Democratic nomination, but a campaign that will defeat whoever the Republican end up nominating. (APPLAUSE) (CHEERING) BASH: Thank you, Madam Secretary. Senator Sanders. (APPLAUSE) (CHEERING) CLINTON: And, I want to say — I also want to say that I do — I do think it is absolutely critical and incredible that we have so many young people involved in the political process. I applaud all of those who are applauding you, Senator Sanders. We’re happy that they are supporting you, that they are passionately committed to you and to the issues. But, let me also say it’s going to be important that we unify the Democratic party when the nomination process has been completed... BASH: ... Secretary Clinton, thank you. CLINTON: And, I know something about that... BASH: ... Secretary Clinton... CLINTON: Thank you so much. Because, when I went to the very end of the 2008 campaign with then Senator Obama... BASH: ...Secretary Clinton, you’re out of time... CLINTON: ... We did unify the party, and we did elect a Democratic president... BASH: ...Senator Sanders, on that note.... SANDERS: ... Let me, if I may just briefly say something... BASH: ... Senator Sanders, I want to ask you a question about this, and you can incorporate that into your response. Three months now between now and the Democratic convention. Your campaign manager says that you will absolutely take the fight to the floor if neither you nor Secretary Clinton clinches the nomination with pledged delegates alone. (APPLAUSE) BASH: Do you vow to take this fight to Philadelphia no matter what? SANDERS: I think we’re going to win this nomination to tell you the truth. (CHEERING) SANDERS: Look, let me acknowledge what is absolutely true. Secretary Clinton cleaned our clock in the Deep South. No question about it. We got murdered there. That is the most conservative part of this great country. That’s the fact. But you know what? We’re out of the Deep South now. And we’re moving up. We got here. We’re going to California. We got a number of large states there. And having won seven out of the last eight caucuses and primaries, having a level of excitement and energy among working people and low-income people doing better against Donald Trump and the other Republicans in poll after poll than Secretary Clinton is, yeah, I believe that we’re going to win this nomination, and I believe we’re going to obliterate Donald Trump or whoever the Republican candidate is. (APPLAUSE) CLINTON: Now, let me say this... BLITZER: Secretary Clinton, go ahead. CLINTON: I think it’s — I think it’s important for people out there watching this tonight to know that I also have a considerable lead in pledged delegates. And my lead in pledged delegates is actually wider than Barack Obama’s lead was over me. And in addition to winning states in the Deep South, we won Florida, Texas, Arizona, Massachusetts, Ohio, Illinois, North Carolina, Missouri. (APPLAUSE) And so I think where we stand today is that we are in this campaign very confident and optimistic, but it all comes down to reaching every single voter. I’m not taking anything for granted or any voter or any place. So I’m going to work my heart out here in New York until the polls close on Tuesday. I’m going to work in Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Delaware and Maryland, all the way through California. And when we end up with the number of delegates we need, we will unite the party and have a unified convention... BLITZER: Senator, go ahead. CLINTON: ... that we’ll go onto the general election with. SANDERS: The reason — the reason why in virtually every contest we are winning by very strong margins younger people — and I’m not just talking about very young. You know, the older you get, the younger young gets — 45 or younger — is I think people are sensing that establishment politics and dependence on Wall Street and big money interest is really never going to address the crises that we face. (APPLAUSE) And people understand, you can’t take money from powerful special interests into your PAC and then really expect the American people to believe you’re going to stand up to these powerful special interests. So I am very proud of the fact that we have brought millions of new people into the political process... BLITZER: Thank you, Senator. SANDERS: ... many of whom previously had given up. BLITZER: Thank you, Senator, very much. The candidates, they will make their final pitches to New York voters right after this. (APPLAUSE) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BLITZER: Welcome back to the CNN presidential debate. It’s time for the candidates’ closing statements. Each candidate will have two minutes. Senator Sanders, you’re first. SANDERS: I grew up in Brooklyn, New York... (APPLAUSE) ... the son of an immigrant who came to this country from Poland at the age of 17 without a nickel in his pocket, never made a whole lot of money, but was a very proud American, because this country gave him and my mom the opportunity to send their kids to college. I believe that this country has enormous potential if we have the guts to take on the big money interests who dominate our economic and political life. And I disagree with Secretary Clinton in the belief that you can get money from Wall Street, that you can get money for a super PAC from powerful special interests, and then at the end of the day do what has to be done for the working families of this country. I just don’t accept that. What I believe is that this country, if we stand together and not let the Trumps of the world divide us up, can guarantee health care to all people as a right, can have paid family and medical leave, can make public colleges and universities tuition-free, can lead the world in transforming our energy system and combatting climate change, can break up the large financial institutions, can demand that the wealthiest people in this country start paying their fair share of taxes. And we can do that when millions of people stand up, fight back, and create a government that works for all of us, not just the 1 percent. (APPLAUSE) That is what the political revolution is about. That is what this campaign is about. And with your help, we’re going to win here in New York. Thank you. Thank you. (APPLAUSE) BLITZER: Secretary Clinton? Secretary Clinton? CLINTON: Thank you. I am very grateful for the fact that the people of New York gave me the great honor of serving as your senator. You took a chance on me in 2000, and then you re-elected me with one of the biggest margins we’ve had in our state in 2006. During those years, we worked closely together. I tried to have your back, and time and time again, you had mine. We took on the challenges of 9/11 together. We got the money to rebuild New York. We came to the aid of our brave first responders, construction workers, and others who endangered their own health by helping to save lives and search for survivors. (APPLAUSE) We worked to create jobs — despite the disastrous policies of George W. Bush — across New York. And we stood up time and time again against all kinds of vested powerful interests. I’m asking for your support again in the primary on Tuesday to continue that work together, to take what we did in New York and to take those New York values to the White House, and put them to work on behalf of all of our people, to knock down the barriers that stand in the way. You know, of course we have economic barriers. I’ve been fighting against those trying to even the odds most of my adult life. But we also have racial barriers, gender barriers, homophobic barriers, disability barriers. (APPLAUSE) We have a lot of barriers that stand in the way of people being treated as they should and having the chance to live up to their own God-given potential. So I am humbly asking for your support on Tuesday. I’ll work my heart out for you again. And together, we won’t just make promises we can’t keep. We’ll deliver results that will improve the lives of the people in New York and in America. (APPLAUSE) That’s what we’ll do together. Thank you, New York. (APPLAUSE) BLITZER: Thank you, Secretary. Thank you very much, Senator. I want to thank the candidates for a really terrific debate. Thanks also to Dana Bash and Errol Louis, as well as NY1, the Democratic National Committee, and everyone here at the Duggal Greenhouse at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Stay with CNN now for complete coverage of the New York primary next Tuesday. Anderson Cooper picks up our debate coverage right now. Advertisement"
"","Advertisement  By  The New York Times  How the election and Donald Trump’s victory looks to Opinion writers.  By  Mary Mann  I bought my first lottery ticket while working the polls. It was a local judgeship election, only 20 voters had come in during the morning “rush,” and talk among the poll workers — pledged to remain in a Brooklyn high school cafeteria with no cellphone service for 15 hours — had turned to gambling. The woman working the ballot-marking device, a part-time Macy’s employee, started talking about her recent trip to Atlantic City. One of the scanner workers, a nurse on leave with a bad knee, said she preferred scratch-off tickets. Another scanner worker, who had attended the high school we were standing in back in the ’60s, said he’d once won $30,000 on a pick-four. That settled it: We would all buy pick-four tickets during our breaks. We spent the next few hours talking about what constitutes “good numbers.” This is not, I suspect, representative of the sort of shenanigans that Donald J. Trump envisioned when he called for Election Day observers to “watch and study and make sure other people don’t come in and vote five times.” Of course, Mr. Trump wasn’t talking about the majority of elections — local and regional affairs. He was talking about the Big Show, the presidential election. “For most people, this is the only time they vote,” a Board of Elections employee told me and the other volunteers during our August retraining course, held in an un-air-conditioned elementary school. “They’ll be confused, asking questions. They won’t know what they’re supposed to do, so you have to.” “Like the primary?” asked a young woman in a hijab. The room was mostly filled with retirees and the underemployed (I’m occasionally one of the latter). A white-haired woman shook her head indulgently. “I’d say you should think of the primary as a dress rehearsal,” the Board of Elections employee said. At the primary, the morning rush had been a proper rush. The hubbub was punctuated by angry outbursts whenever names were found missing from the list of registered voters, which was a particular problem in Brooklyn this year. If your name isn’t on the list you can vote via affidavit ballot, but it’s frustrating to know that you’re registered yet somehow not. Poll workers bore the brunt of this frustration, as some voters complained about our ineptitude, and others complained about the long lines that resulted from the time it took us to listen to all the complaints. Poll workers aren’t responsible for the list of registered voters — in fact, they don’t see it until Election Day — but there’s no reason voters would know that. We’re the only people in the election that most voters see face-to-face, yet we’re perhaps the piece of that process that they know the least about. There is no poll-site version of “Veep.” As a result, it might be easy to imagine the worst — to picture us aiding fraudsters in wigs sneaking in to vote 20 times. But there are very few cases of voter fraud, according to multiple studies, news investigations and government inquests. And if someone did try to vote twice, at least at my polling site, he’d have grandmothers all over him, scolding and calling for the police officer who’s always at the door. There was plenty of time to reflect on all this during the primary. Like the adage about war, poll work consists of long stretches of boredom punctuated by moments of terror. We whiled away the afternoon talking about people’s grandkids until 6 o’clock rolled around. Here was the second rush, a heady mix of proud “I Voted” stickers and irate scribbles on affidavit ballots. There’s something about that buzz of elections that’s addictive, like gambling, I guess. It’s what brings me back to the polls, again and again, showing up at 5 a.m. even when I don’t have the time to spare. It’s a gamble: How the day will go, how the next four years will go.  By  Daniel K. Williams  Donald J. Trump was elected with a higher percentage of the white evangelical vote than any other Republican presidential candidate has ever received, and he has received strong support from prominent Christian Right leaders. Yet if Mr. Trump delivers on his promises, he will not give the religious right what its leaders have traditionally demanded or what the Republican Party platform calls for. Indeed, he will give them very little national legislation at all, but will instead offer them maximum latitude to pursue their agenda at the state level — a shift that may portend a potential breakthrough in the nation’s polarizing culture wars. National legislation has long been the goal of the religious right. When the movement emerged in the late 1970s, evangelical leaders such as Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson sought federal constitutional amendments to ban abortion and restore school prayer, because they wanted to reverse what liberal rights activists had done at the national level through the Supreme Court. In the early 21st century, leaders such as James Dobson continued this trend by persuading   President George W. Bush to endorse a constitutional amendment proposal to define marriage as exclusively heterosexual. In recent years, evangelicals have become so concerned about protecting their own religious liberty against federal mandates or court decisions that they have given less attention to imposing a moral agenda on the rest of the nation. Although the Republican Party platform continues to promise a constitutional amendment protecting human life from the moment of conception, the pro-life movement has not made any serious attempts to pass that amendment since the 1980s. Nor has there been much talk in the last decade of a national ban on same-sex marriage. Mr. Trump is well positioned to promote a further shift away from national moral regulation. For much of his adult life, he held culturally libertarian views on abortion and gay rights, and he evinced little interest in the religious right’s agenda. Early in his campaign, he expressed discomfort with conservative evangelicals’ opposition to the rights of transgender people to use the public restroom of their choice. But he quickly came to embrace a “states’ rights” position on same-sex marriage and transgender rights, a position that would allow culturally liberal New Yorkers the right to pursue different policies than cultural conservatives in Mississippi or North Dakota. And while Mr. Trump stumbled over abortion during his campaign, the policy that he ultimately reverted to was to leave abortion legalization up to the states — an outcome that he would try to ensure by nominating conservative Supreme Court justices who might overturn Roe v. Wade. Mr. Trump has gone further than any previous Republican presidential nominee in a generation in insisting that the religious right should enact its agenda at the state, rather than federal, level.  Although this was the policy position of many Republicans during the 1970s (including President Gerald Ford), religious right activists persuaded the G.O.P. in the early 1980s to abandon its states-rights approach to abortion and other social issues, and promise national legislation to implement the religious right’s agenda. Mr. Trump is leading the party back to its more traditional stance. While many liberals will find this outcome unsatisfactory — since it offers them no opportunity to secure national protection for individual rights that they consider inalienable — it may be the only compromise solution that can give both conservatives and liberals the freedom to pursue their own agenda at the local level without fear of a national backlash. If a socially libertarian New Yorker can deliver this compromise to the conservative white rural evangelical voters who put him in office, both conservatives and liberals should see that for what it is: a landmark opportunity to move beyond the culture wars.  By  Marwan Bishara  Just when the people of the Middle East thought things couldn’t get any worse, Donald J. Trump is elected president of the United States. Now, their apprehension about the president-elect dwarfs their disappointment with President Obama. It could be a blessing in disguise. America, in one magic moment, you’ve revealed how you’ve changed. For the worse. Poor you, you feel so insecure, vulnerable and fragile. Like the rest of us. So, instead of reaching for your famed “can-do” spirit, lifting yourselves up by the bootstraps, you turned to a strident, bellicose type of nationalism. The kind usually associated with strutting generalissimos of Third World nations with their chests covered with made-up, self-awarded medals. Maybe the people of the Middle East will look and realize that you are no longer the Great Democracy to emulate. That your modern style of empire and your role as keeper of the world order for the world’s own good are stumbling and failing, even in your own eyes; and that we in the Middle East should not be turning to you for rescue. For as long as I can remember, you’ve been on a self-assigned mission to change the Middle East. Indeed, the world. Now, it seems as if the change has flowed the other way. You’ve voted to reduce your liberties. To narrow the range of people entitled to justice and equality before the law. To live in a place where the police should not be criticized; where fighting political correctness is more important than fighting racism; where Muslims are suspected and people who appear Hispanic can be rounded up if they’re not carrying their papers. In this election you’ve revealed that your people — like Russians, Hungarians, Iraqis, Iranians and others whose politics you normally look down on — will choose a narrow, nonsensical nationalist ethos when they feel threatened by uncertainty. Your imperial outreach allowed you to experience other cultures, but now you’ve chosen to shrink your outlook, with the expectation that the world will continue to revolve around you. It won’t. Like the rest of us, you’re now divided between those who want to make their nation great again alone and those who want to make it great together. O.K., enough about you; let’s talk about us. We in the Middle East can’t decipher what exactly your incoming president wants from us. I don’t think he knows, either. Mr. Trump said he would bring back torture and ban Muslims from entering America, and he compared the threat of “radical Islam” to Soviet Communism. He wants less engagement in the region, and fewer “free riders” like the Saudis who don’t pay enough for American protection. And he wants the United States to abandon the costly nation-building in the Middle East. What nation-building? In Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Yemen, Libya and Somalia, civil wars continue unabated. The Arab and Muslim worlds only hope the United States stops contributing to the destruction.
Mr. Trump does not exactly seem concerned for the wishes of Middle Easterners and their right to live in peace. It sounds more like what he really wants to do is pal around with other strutting, authoritarian types. Expect him to cozy up to Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, and join him in supporting Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad. Expect America’s new president to work closely with Egypt’s president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, and Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. Mr. Trump has embraced Mr. Netanyahu’s positions on Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and on abandoning the two-state solution. Instead of Americanizing the Middle East, Mr. Trump seems set on “Israelizing” America, stirring fear of Muslims and trying to wall out “the other.” Arabs, and Middle Easterners in general, should take one quick look and figure out how to be less dependent on the United States, and how to resolve their conflicts within their own, regional frameworks.
Finally, some good news. President Obama has assured us that the sun will rise tomorrow, regardless. And if the Trump presidency is as bad as I expect it to be — though not so bad that it demolishes democracy entirely — he can be voted out in four years. Meanwhile, fasten your seatbelts. It’s going to be a hell of a ride.  By  Carol Giacomo  A commitment to human rights has been a fundamental precept of NATO since the alliance was created a half century ago. You would not expect that a founding member would have to be reminded of that fact. Certainly not the United States, for all those years the leader of NATO and an inspirational embodiment of its core values. Yet this is where we find ourselves now, the day after Donald Trump won the presidency: In congratulating him on his victory, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany felt compelled to set conditions for cooperation. “Germany and America are connected by values of democracy, freedom and respect for the law and the dignity of man, independent of origin, skin color, religion, gender, sexual orientation or political views,” she said in a statement, adding: “I offer the next President of the United States close cooperation on the basis of these values.” Mr. Trump’s behavior during his campaign was antithetical to those values. He has threatened to ban Muslims from the United States, refuse refugees, deport 11 million undocumented workers and build a wall on the border with Mexico. He has disparaged African Americans, Mexican Americans, women and people with disabilities. Moreover, Mr. Trump has called into question America’s commitment to NATO and displayed a befuddling penchant for defending Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, who is waging war in eastern Ukraine and destabilizing other parts of Europe by supporting far-right groups. He received no pushback on Wednesday from Theresa May, the British prime minister, who simply congratulated Mr. Trump on his win. The two leaders’ reactions were further proof that, after Britain’s decision to leave the European Union, we will have to look to Mrs. Merkel not just to lead Europe but to replace America in leading NATO as well.  By  Gil Troy  “I am scared that if Ronald Reagan gets into office, we are going to see more of the Ku Klux Klan and a resurgence of the Nazi Party,” Coretta Scott King said in November, 1980. “I’m afraid things are going to blow sky high during this next term,” a nursing student said. He’s a “nitwit,” added a Democrat. “He’s shallow, superficial and frightening,” one of that year’s historic numbers of “undecideds” insisted. Ronald Reagan “seems not to relish complexity and subtlety,” the New York Times editorial endorsing President Jimmy Carter’s re-election proclaimed. “The problem is not a loose lip but the simple answer.”  While fearing what Reagan’s own running mate, George H.W. Bush, had dismissed as Reagan’s “voodoo economics” during their primary fight, the editorial board feared “voodoo diplomacy,” too. From coast to coast, half of a divided nation abhorred —  and underestimated — the president-elect. “The American people,“ Hamilton Jordan, a key Carter aide, said, "are not going to elect a 70-year-old, right-wing, ex-movie actor to be president.” Pollsters reported in 1980 that “More voters held negative attitudes toward each presidential candidate than in any campaign since polling began” — a record we just broke in 2016. The economic dislocation of galloping inflation and the energy crisis produced a nasty campaign. Feeling neglected by Washington, millions embraced Ronald Reagan’s populism. Despite the Democratic panic, Ronald Reagan left America richer and safer after two terms as president. Reagan defied expectations by turning toward the center. He acted as president of the United States, not president of the Republican Party. Reagan used the transition period to heal wounds while claiming a broad policy mandate, despite winning only 50.7 percent of the popular vote. He vowed to “rebuild a bipartisan base for American foreign policy.” His cabinet choices were so moderate that Pat Buchanan, the conservative flamethrower whose rhetorical bluster anticipated the advent of Donald Trump, lamented: “Where is the dash, color, and controversy — the customary concomitants of a Reagan campaign?” Just weeks into Reagan’s first term, conservatives were demanding that his aides had to “Let Reagan be Reagan,” meaning: stop being so reasonable. But in adjusting, in tempering, Reagan was being Reagan. He knew the Constitution limited presidential powers — and he faced a Democratic Congress led by the formidable speaker of the House Tip O’Neill to remind him further. Illustrating Richard Neustadt’s lesson that the power of the president is mostly “the power to persuade,” many of Reagan’s achievements were symbolic. Rather than shrinking government as he promised, for example, he only lowered the federal government’s growth rate. History is not destiny. And Reagan had both a lighter touch than Mr. Trump, and eight years’ experience as  governor of California. Still, history is full of shifts and surprises. Mr. Trump must be a healer and unite America, as he tried doing in his victory speech. If he fails, the checks and balances that sometimes help crusading ideologues become effective leaders can ultimately impose a necessary gridlock. When asked about conservatives’ frustration with him, Reagan kindly insisted it was only a “very few” critics. He said: “There are some people who think that you should, on principle, jump off the cliff with the flag flying if you can’t get everything you want.” Reagan recalled that “If I found when I was governor that I could not get 100 percent of what I asked for, I took 80 percent.” So far, Mr. Trump, the political amateur and sputtering demagogue, has lacked Reagan’s magnanimity or his flexibility. Can the reality-show star turned president-elect mimic the actor turned president?  By  James R. Jones  In 1968, there was a demand among voters for change, especially regarding Vietnam and foreign policy, and there was a backlash against some of the Great Society programs. Then, as now, the Democratic candidate was tied to the departing administration and hamstrung to differentiate a new set of policies. As a result, the Democratic presidential nominee, Hubert H. Humphrey, narrowly lost to the Republican, Richard M. Nixon, a candidate who was despised by a large percentage of the electorate. One positive outcome of that election was the first organized transition from the departing to incoming governments. President Lyndon B. Johnson always believed that, after an election, Democrats and Republicans should come together to do what’s right for the country. At the time, I was President Johnson’s appointments secretary, the position that has since evolved into the White House chief of staff. Right after the 1968 results came in, the president put me in charge of organizing a transition process, something that had never been done. “Nixon is an S.O.B., but he’s the only president we’ll have,” Johnson told me. “I want him and all of his team to be fully prepared to govern after the Inauguration at 12 noon on January 20.” A few days later, Johnson and Nixon met at the White House along with Nixon’s top advisers, including H. R. Haldeman and John Mitchell. There we mapped out a program in which all of the Johnson cabinet and major White House staff members would brief their incoming counterparts as often as was desired by the new administration. My charge was to work with Haldeman, who became my successor at the White House, to make sure these briefings occurred across the new administration and in a timely fashion. One surprise was that Nixon told me that Mitchell could speak for him in all matters if he was not available. Johnson would have never delegated such authority, but that was the difference in the management style of the two men. While a smooth transition was important to Johnson, he didn’t stop being president. He was issuing orders and making appointments right up to the morning of the Inauguration. In fact, the day before the Inauguration the president told me to find out how many vacancies existed on commissions and boards and find good people that he could nominate. He kept Nixon waiting in the Blue Room on Inauguration morning while he signed those nominations (which required Senate confirmation) and had them delivered to the Congress before noon. It is a positive sign that President Obama invited Donald J. Trump to meet at the White House two days after this most contentious election. Today transitions are much more institutional now than our first one in 1968. But this process can heal many wounds and start bringing our country closer together. That’s imperative if we want to make our government work for the people again. Back in 1968, Johnson and Nixon left the White House together, along with Senator Everett Dirksen and me. We jumped into the car and headed to the Capitol. Surprisingly, Nixon wanted only to discuss how disappointed he was to have lost Texas (Johnson’s home state) and how determined he was to win it in1972. I hope the ride to the Capitol next January will be more substantive on policy.  By  Sarah Jaffe  If anything has been made clear by the results of this election, it is that the political and pundit class have underestimated the degree of anger and pain in the United States, the degree to which “recovery” has been recovery for a few and stagnation and decline for many more. One exit poll has been haunting me since I saw it: The Reuters/Ipsos early exit poll found that 75 percent of respondents agreed “America needs a strong leader to take the country back from the rich and powerful.” Only slightly fewer agreed that “the American economy is rigged to advantage the rich and powerful,” and — perhaps the kicker — 68 percent believed that “traditional parties and politicians don’t care about people like me.” There’s a lot to unpack in those statements. They may conceal white resentment of the perceived advancement past them of black and Latino people. But they also reveal the sentiment that has been there since the 2008 financial crisis laid bare the lines of power in the country and the world — when, as the protest chant went, “Banks got bailed out, we got sold out.” The downward trends have been with us for decades: the divergence of productivity gains from workers’ incomes, the substitution of credit card debt for raises, the shift of good union jobs and family wages and pensions into low-wage service jobs, and the attendant slashing of the social safety net. But the past eight years sped all that up and made it impossible to ignore. If Donald J. Trump stood out to voters from the rest of the Republican Party, aside from a willingness to say directly the kinds of things usually carefully dogwhistled, it was in his rants about trade and his lack of interest in dismantling the remnants of the welfare state. For white Americans anxiously looking at their disappearing stability, Mr. Trump was a bomb they were willing to throw at a system they felt was failing them. He emotionally echoed their outrage and gave them a place to direct their anger, the age-old right-wing populist trick of refracting it both upward at elites and downward at minorities. Hillary Clinton’s campaign and the mainstream Democratic Party were woefully unprepared to greet this wave. When your response to a cry of “Make America Great Again!” is “America Is Already Great!” you’d better be sure that it feels true to a majority of voters. The results show that it did not. To be sure, Democrats had an uneasy line to walk, between maintaining continuity with a still-popular, twice-elected Barack Obama — a continuity that won Mrs. Clinton the Democratic primary — and reaching the people who wanted and needed change. But the party’s wholehearted backing of Mrs. Clinton was a colossal misreading of a moment when rage at the establishment (of both parties) was simmering everywhere. That rage should have been visible as Mr. Trump ran away with the Republican nomination process despite the opposition of that party’s grandees, and as Bernie Sanders pushed Mrs. Clinton much harder than anyone had expected a gray-haired socialist from Vermont to do. But Mrs. Clinton opened her arms to disaffected Republicans rather than wooing the disaffected within and around her own party. Most of the television ads she ran were more about painting Trump as a dangerous aberration, an outsider unfit for office, than pitching any plan of her own for change. Democrats failed to realize that for many Trump voters, that was exactly what they liked about him.  By  Will Wilkinson  It may not be an exaggeration to say that Donald Trump both knows and cares less about the details of public policy than anyone ever elected president of the United States. This just goes to show that “politics is not about policy,” as Robin Hanson, the futurist and social theorist, likes to say. Mr. Trump’s playbook against Hillary Clinton broke with the hard-won norms of liberal democracy, went back to demagogic, authoritarian political basics, and updated them for  the reality television, social media age. Politics is, at bottom, about factions vying and coordinating to choose leaders in whom to invest authority. Throughout the campaign, Mr. Trump displayed an uncanny and unnerving mastery of the primal politics of authority, and the game of legitimizing his own and delegitimizing his rivals’ claims to authority. In Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump drew a general election opponent pre-weakened by a decades-long Republican campaign of delegitimization. He took advantage of it with shameless audacity, making the most of our culture’s lingering sexism and the popular perception of Mrs. Clinton as a member of an arrogant and corrupt elite that believes it is above the law. But tearing down his opponents was only half of Trump’s equation. The pundits and pollsters so badly botched their predictions in no small part because they failed to grasp the intense, reality-distorting power of Donald Trump’s fame. But Mr. Trump seems to have an intuitive understanding that glamour, celebrity and gaudy wealth are key ingredients in majesty — which is inherently authoritative and underwrites its own claim to legitimacy. Trump’s self-branded personal jet was more than a convenient means of transportation for a very rich man. It was a purple silk, ermine-fringed cape, Air Force One in waiting, and he knew how to use it. The United States, the world’s first nation founded on principled opposition to the pre-Enlightenment politics of majesty and unified authority, has deep-seated norms of republican modesty and propriety. Casting those norms aside and banking heavily on the atavistic political appeal of majestic celebrity gave Mr. Trump an advantage few us were prepared to acknowledge, allowing him to attract the support of an unforeseen numbers of black, Hispanic and female voters, despite his campaign’s naked racism and his scandalously misogynistic and abusive personal history. Because Mr. Trump’s strategy was so indifferent to matters of policy substance, it is incredibly difficult to say what policies Mr. Trump will actually support in office. I don’t think we’ve ever known less about what an incoming president really wants to do with his power. But we do have a clear indication of how he’s likely to wield it. He will cleverly burnish his claim to authority and relentlessly and effectively discredit his opponents, inside and outside the Republican Party, with all the tools of an executive branch that has never been more powerful and less constrained by the constitutional system America’s founders designed specifically as an alternative to and a bulwark against unitary authority.  By  Lindy West  I got up on Election Day and burst into tears — not a genteel twin trickle but a great heaving burst, zero to firehose. Tears spattered the inside of my glasses, dripped from my lips, and left mascara-tinged rosettes blooming black in my cereal milk. “Honey,” my husband crooned to me. “Honey, it’s going to be O.K. The numbers are still good. It’s O.K.” But it wasn’t the numbers. I wasn’t sobbing because I was afraid Hillary Clinton was going to lose. That would come later. I was sobbing Tuesday morning because, as I poured my coffee, I’d caught a glimpse of a cable news interview with Mrs. Clinton just after she voted for herself in Chappaqua, N.Y. She seemed breathless, exhilarated, a little overwhelmed. Over her shoulder, Bill Clinton stared at his wife and beamed. My husband stares at me like that sometimes. It’s not just love — we expect husbands to love their wives — but something less traditional, more conditional and gendered. It’s professional respect. It’s pride. We’re accustomed to that pride flowing the other direction, from wife to husband, because men in our culture get to be more than just bodies, do more than just nurture. Men get to act and excel and climb and aspire and thrive and win and rule and be the audacious, hungry fulcrum of public life. It is normal for men to have ambition. It is normal for women to stand aside. I thought about Bill Clinton meeting Hillary Rodham at Yale in 1971, and how tenacious and intense she must have been even back then, how undeniable and potent. Mr. Clinton describes the moment in his memoir . “She conveyed a sense of strength and self-possession I had rarely seen in anyone, man or woman,“ he wrote. "She was in my face from the start.” He says he once told her , during those years, “I have met all the most gifted people in our generation and you’re the best.” And then I thought about Mr. Clinton rising steadily through his political career, on the track we have built for charismatic, competent white men. He must have known, every second, how good his wife was. Not just good, but “the best.” Better than everyone he’d ever met; better than him, even. And he watched her stand next to him and wait, and wait, and wait, underestimated and degraded and excoriated for wanting more out of life than cookies. And she didn’t quit! She swallowed slander and humiliation and irrational hatred for three decades and she didn’t quit, and here she was, just a hair’s breadth from the presidency of the United States — the first woman ever to be trusted with the rudder of the world. He must be so proud of her, I thought. It made me cry. I cried because I want my daughters to feel that blazing pride, that affirmation of their boundless capacity — not from their husbands, but from their world, from the atmosphere, from inviolable wells of certainty inside themselves. I cried because it’s not fair, and I’m so tired, and every woman I know is so tired. I cried because I don’t even know what it feels like to be taken seriously — not fully, not in that whole, unequivocal, confident way that’s native to handshakes between men. I cried because it does things to you to always come second. Whatever your personal opinion of the Clintons, as politicians or as human beings, that dynamic is real. We, as a culture, do not take women seriously on a profound level. We do not believe women. We do not trust women. We do not like women. I understand that many men cannot see it, and plenty more do not care. I know that many men will read this and laugh, or become defensive, or call me hysterical, or worse, and that’s fine. I am used to it. It doesn’t make me wrong. But maybe this election was the beginning of something new, I thought. Not the death of sexism, but the birth of a world in which women’s inferiority isn’t a given. That grain of hope glowed inside me until around dinner time on Tuesday, the final day of an election so openly misogynist that the question “Sexual assault: good or bad?” was credulously presented for debate. Today doesn’t feel real. It is indistinguishable from fresh, close grief. But if there’s one lesson we can take from Mrs. Clinton, politics aside — and even Donald Trump acknowledged it in the second debate — it’s the limitlessness of human endurance. Those of us who have been left in the cold by this apparent affirmation of a white supremacist patriarchy (and sorry, white women who voted for Mr. Trump, but your shelter is illusory) are tough. We have been weathering this hurricane wall of doubt and violence for so long, and now, more crystalline than ever, we have an enemy and a mandate. We have the smirking apotheosis of our oppression sliming, paw-first, toward our genitals. We have the popular vote. We have proof, in exit polls, that white women will pawn their humanity for the safety of white supremacy. We have abortion pills to stockpile and neighbors to protect and children to teach. We have the right woman to find. We have local elections in a year. The fact that we lost doesn’t make us wrong; the fact that they don’t believe in us doesn’t make us disappear.  By  Seth Grossman  A couple of years ago, I produced a reality-TV show called “Hollywood Hillbillies,” about a family from rural Georgia who, driven by the grandson’s newfound internet fame, moves west to make it in Hollywood. The show centered on the undeniable charisma of “Mema,” the foul-mouthed matriarch who spoke her mind and poked fun at the habits and attitudes of the Los Angeles elite. The show was part of a wave of “redneck reality” shows like “Swamp People,” “Duck Dynasty,” “Bayou Billionaires” and “Moonshiners” that presented a vision of white, rural America as the last authentic place on earth, the last place untarnished by the corruption and cynicism of the elites. “Hollywood Hillbillies” aired on the Reelz Network, a channel owned by a billionaire Republican donor Stanley Hubbard , who funded a pro-Trump “super” PAC after his preferred candidates lost the primaries. Designed as a harmless comedy, the show reveled in Mema’s provocative, off-color remarks, just as Donald J. Trump’s audience revels in his. But now I’m thinking more critically about what shows like this are selling. All of these shows have one thing in common: While trafficking in rural stereotypes, they celebrate wealth and business success — whether that business is crafting hick-hop music, catching alligators or designing duck calls. Ostensibly produced for middle America, they offer a population disenfranchised by globalization and the information economy a vision of rural ingenuity rewarded. Mr. Trump based his candidacy around this population. He spoke directly to voters raised on reality TV, addressing their fears and aspirations with blunt talk. He became their perfect celebrity champion, a rich white man, his image polished by years in a reality-TV boardroom, who validated their demographic anxiety. In an election season driven more by hatred of political opponents than enthusiasm for two deeply unpopular candidates, President-Elect Donald J. Trump hated best, and won. I am wondering today if the same embarrassment that prevents some of us from admitting that we watch “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” also kept Trump supporters from admitting to pollsters that they were voting for a man they knew the media considered a bigot. Two months ago, I started working on a new series, “Trumpigration,” a travel show about where to move if Donald Trump somehow got elected. That, too, was designed as a lighthearted comedy. Now, facing the prospect of four years of a Trump presidency, it’s beginning to feel like the last chance to change the channel.  By  Roberto Suro  If you are in shock over the election results, don’t blame Latinos. They favored Hillary Clinton by better than two to one, according to the exit polls. They did not turn out in big numbers to protest Donald J. Trump, but it probably would not have mattered. It turns out that Latinos were the election’s biggest losers and not just because Mr. Trump won the presidency after a long campaign of slinging threats and insults at them. The bitterest loss was dealt by the 59.5 million mostly white people who voted for Mr. Trump. That was a rejection by their own countrymen. According to the exit polls — a rough measure of turnout at best — Latinos accounted for 11 percent of the votes cast Tuesday the same as 2012. If those numbers hold, there was little or no Trump effect, and however much the number of Latino votes increased was just a result of demography. You may have been convinced that it would be otherwise. Years of reckless commentary, news stories and advocacy insisted that Latinos would be the great demographic firewall that would safeguard progressive politics with surging population numbers. But, the firewall only stands in a few states, and the biggest of them, California, New York and Texas, are already decided. Mr. Trump concentrated instead on the old industrial states where Latinos are a sparse presence. When he demonized Mexico and unauthorized immigrants, he gained more in the Electoral College by mobilizing white voters than he lost by alienating Latinos. The national exit polls show that Mrs. Clinton drew 65 percent of the Latino vote compared with 29 percent for Mr. Trump. That is a landslide by any measure, and it is about the same margin in the exit polls for 2008 (67 percent vs. 31 percent). The disappointment sets in when you compare the outcome to 2012. President Barack Obama took 71 percent of the Latino vote in the exit polls that year compared with 27 percent for Mitt Romney. Mr. Trump was supposed to be the bucket of cold water that aroused the sleeping giant, producing not only a stronger preference for the Democratic candidate but also, more important, a spike in turnout. In 2012, with immigration reform on the line, more than 12 million Latino voters stayed home, producing a turnout rate of 48 percent compared with 64 percent for whites and 67 percent for blacks. The much ballyhooed and chronicled “Trump Effect” was supposed to have produced a surge in naturalizations and voter registration over the past year, and news organizations were churning out stories about the “surge” in Latino voting even after the polls closed Tuesday. While more time and data is needed to get a full picture of Latino turnout this year, at first glance it appears Latino numbers were up, and perhaps significantly in some places, but that in fact the giant was barely stirred. Four million more Latinos were eligible to vote Tuesday than in 2012. So, no matter who was running and no matter how low the turnout, the number of Latino votes counted Tuesday was virtually certain to be higher than 2012. In fact, demographic growth alone would have guaranteed Mrs. Clinton an additional 1.3 million votes (about 1 percent of the total votes cast), even if turnout remained at the same dismal rate as 2012, and she got two-thirds of the Latino votes. In Colorado and Nevada, Latino voters surely helped keep the states blue, and under different scenarios those states could have served as the much-advertised Latino firewall. The one real bright spot for Latino Democrats Tuesday came with the election of Catherine Cortez Masto to the Senate in Nevada. That vote may illustrate what it takes to wake up the Latino electorate: a charismatic and qualified candidate, strong mediating institutions, in this case the hospitality workers’ unions in Las Vegas, and well-organized political operation like the one created by Senator Harry Reid, the retiring Democratic leader. Meanwhile, something may have happened in Texas that needs a closer look. Mr. Trump won handily, but only by a 9 percent margin. President Obama lost the state by nearly 16 points in 2012 and by almost 12 points in 2008. A lot of non-Latino newcomers have begun to change the political complexion of the state in recent years, and that formula — newcomers plus Latinos — is what flipped Colorado and Nevada in the past. Florida is the one place where Latinos might have been able to change the results of this election and didn’t. In the exit polls, Latinos accounted for 18 percent of the total vote compared with 17 in 2012, and the split was slightly more favorable to Mrs. Clinton than it was for President Obama four years ago. Mrs. Clinton’s vote tally was more than 200,000 higher than President Obama’s, but Mr. Trump’s was more than 400,000 higher than Mr. Romney’s. And therein lies the result that Latinos will have to live with for the next four years. In a state that has vividly benefited from immigration and trade, a state where Latinos have for the most part prospered and contributed to the prosperity of their neighbors, white voters mobilized to elect a candidate who would angrily erase everything Latinos represent. No one else suffered that kind of defeat on Tuesday.  By  Kevin M. Kruse  With so many predictions about this presidential campaign having turned out to be so very wrong, comparisons to the 1948 presidential race come naturally. In that election, virtually everyone predicted that the Republican Thomas Dewey would beat the “accidental president,” the Democrat, Harry Truman. Pollsters reinforced these assumptions. Elmer Roper announced that he was so sure Dewey would win that he wouldn’t even bother reporting poll results anymore. “My silence on this point can be construed as an indication that Mr. Dewey is still so clearly ahead that we might as well just listen to his inaugural address,” he said. George Gallup kept polling until mid-October, but then rested on those results, assuming the race was over. Pundits agreed. Newsweek surveyed 50 of the nation’s top political reporters in October; every single one said Dewey would win. Republicans and Democrats alike assumed the race was over. On election night, the conservative Chicago Tribune was so confident it called the race early, rushing out a banner headline that would soon be as famous as it was wrong: “Dewey Defeats Truman.” To the amazement of nearly everyone, Truman won by considerable margins. In the popular vote, he took 49.6 percent to Dewey’s 45.1 percent. In the Electoral College, he won 303 votes to Dewey’s 189. While the margins of this year’s election are narrower, the shock and confusion of pollsters and analysts seems just as pronounced. But comparisons between the Truman and Trump campaigns are not neatly drawn. Truman was an outspoken liberal, and he campaigned on preserving and expanding the accomplishments of the New Deal welfare state. He called for expansion of Social Security, more progressive forms of taxation, a higher minimum wage, and a new national system of health insurance. Truman also committed the Democratic Party, long dominated by Southern segregationists, to a new racial liberalism. Notably, he called on Congress to protect the voting rights of African-Americans. In foreign policy, Truman set America against the growing influence of the Soviet Union. In 1947, he announced the Truman Doctrine, which prompted economic aid to Europe through the Marshall Plan and military alliances through a new North Atlantic Treaty Organization. A year later, Truman challenged Soviet expansionism with the Berlin Airlift. Mr. Trump has rejected much of the substance of Truman’s campaign, but in many ways he reflected its style. Truman’s famous “whistle-stop campaign” took him to rural communities and small towns where working-class and middle-class whites felt neglected. In fiery speeches with blunt language, he singled out sources of blame. Truman went after the “do nothing” Republican Congress as a prominent foe, but also denounced an array of “special interests,” including “bloodsuckers who have offices on Wall Street.” Truman named these enemies and promised to “give ’em’ hell.” His crowds believed him and rallied to their candidate. On Election Day, he predicted there were would be “a lot of surprised pollsters.” There were. Though he had reason to gloat, Truman was gracious in victory. The day after the election, the Washington Post staff invited him to a “crow banquet.” All the newspaper pundits, radio commentators and pollsters who predicted his defeat would wear sackcloth and force down a main course of crow; the president, in white tie and tails, would be served roast turkey. Truman declined, saying he had “no desire to crow over anybody or to see anybody eat crow, figuratively or otherwise.” He added, “We should all get together now and make a country in which everybody can eat turkey whenever he pleases.” Mr. Trump is not a politician who operates by anyone else’s playbook, but perhaps in this small but important matter, he can take a lesson from history.  By  Maureen Sullivan  I have to admit it: I am loving it. As the results poured in for Donald J. Trump, I reveled in the Facebook friends who openly mourned the end of humanity. I felt gleeful in trolling the Twitter hashtag #HesNotMyPresident: “I’m laying in bed with tears streaming down my face, just thinking about the future of this country.” This was one of the biggest election upsets in history, so of course everyone is stunned. Me too. Switching among three cable news networks and several websites I wondered: Is he really going to take Florida so easily? Did they just call North Carolina for Trump? Can he possibly win Wisconsin? Pennsylvania? Yup. I rooted for Mitt Romney in 2012 and John McCain in 2008. I ran for the school board in Hoboken, N.J., and lost once before winning the following year. I know what it’s like to have your hopes puddle up on the floor like that dollop of election-night Haagen-Dazs that you dropped and you just don’t care to wipe up. What does it matter? All is lost. You want to announce on Twitter that you are in bed letting the tears stream down your face. I saw this result coming over the summer. In July, five police officers were ambushed in Dallas and three more were killed in Baton Rouge. In August, Colin Kaepernick, the San Francisco 49ers quarterback, sat out the national anthem. In September, an Islamic terrorist, masquerading as a fried chicken salesman in my hometown, Elizabeth, N.J., set off bombs in New York and New Jersey. Mrs. Clinton proclaimed: “I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police.” She put half of Trump’s supporters in that “basket of deplorables.” People I know were angry. They were tired of being told they were racist and bigoted as they went about the business of mowing their lawns, writing college tuition checks and working their jobs as cops, secretaries and teachers’ aides. They kept being told they needed to look inward, examine their sins and judge themselves guilty. They had not forgotten when Barack Obama was running for president in 2008 and his wife, Michelle, said, “For the first time in my adult lifetime, I’m really proud of my country…” So now we have President-Elect Donald Trump. I supported him because he promised to curb regulations, cut taxes and appoint constitutionalists to the Supreme Court. I supported him because Mrs. Clinton doesn’t have what it takes to turn around a stagnant economy or stand up to the special interests that block innovation. In his victory speech, Mr. Trump lifted a line from Abraham Lincoln and spoke of “binding wounds.” I wanted him to be gracious and kind in that moment, and he was. My 89-year-old mother is still appalled by my vote and tells me, with a laugh, that she’s moving to Ireland. And one of my disappointed female friends on Facebook — who, like me is white and college-educated — wrote, “Obama helped expose the deeply racist nature of our country. Trump exposes the anti-intellectual, sexist xenophobia.” But most of my friends, some of whom I suspect cast votes like mine, have stayed quiet. I guess it’s still not politically correct to admit that you are on the Trump train.  By  Viet Thanh Nguyen  Worst-case scenario in the next four years: fascism, a wall, mass deportations, the end of Obamacare, a Trump brand on the White House and either a trade war or an actual war with China (since war is the easiest diversion from domestic unhappiness). Best-case scenario: Ruth Bader Ginsburg refuses to retire or die, the Democratic Party finds a backbone, turns away from its fixation on the center and heeds the call for an economic revolt against the 1 percent, joined by Black Lives Matter, the Occupy movement, and resurgent feminism. Both scenarios could happen at the same time. The second scenario requires Democrats to put their status quo political model to rest. They already had a significant portion of the nonwhite minority vote locked up, but have lost too many working-class white people. Bernie Sanders might not have won over the wealthier whites who were voting with Trump against the seemingly rising tide of minorities, but he might have snared the white working class and some of the white middle class. Here’s the bright side, for those, like me, who are on the liberal-to-left spectrum. If Hillary Clinton had won, she would have run again in 2020, which could have meant four more years of Wall Street liberalism and fire-and-forget perpetual warfare, conducted by drones and Special Operations over the horizon. Now perhaps Elizabeth Warren will be the 2020 Democratic candidate — a white woman, a feminist, and someone more progressive than Clinton. But all this speaks largely about domestic electoral politics. The sickness of the American body politic remains untreated, and will remain untreated, or exacerbated, in a country run by clowns, conspirators, and collaborators. That sickness is imperialism. America is an imperial country, and its decay might now be showing. The power that has brought so much benefit to the country — for white people — is now faltering in its ability to provide those benefits to all white people. The empire’s best hope is to be more inclusive, demographically and economically, but that runs counter to the imperial impulse to hoard power and profit. Warren or someone like her might be better at extracting more social and economic justice for all Americans. But unless such a person finds a way to ease control from the financial-industrial complex, the prospects of halting our decline are weak. Empires rot from the inside even as emperors blame the barbarians.  By  Robert N. Stavins  Donald J. Trump once tweeted that “the concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing noncompetitive.” Twitter messages may not be clear signs of likely public policies, but Mr. Trump followed up during the campaign with his “America First Energy Plan,” which would rescind all of President Obama’s actions on climate change. The plan includes canceling United States participation in the Paris climate agreement and stopping all American funding of United Nations climate change programs. It also includes abandoning the Clean Power Plan, a mainstay of the Obama administration’s approach to achieving its emissions reduction target for carbon dioxide under the Paris agreement. What should we make of such campaign promises? Taking Mr. Trump at his word, he will surely seek to pull the country out of the Paris pact. But because the agreement has already come into force, under the rules, any party must wait three years before requesting to withdraw, followed by a one-year notice period. Those rules would seem to be mere technicalities. The incoming Trump administration simply can disregard America’s pledge to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 26 to 28 percent below the 2005 level by 2025. That is bad enough. But the big worry is what other key countries, including the world’s largest emitter, China, as well as India and Brazil, will do if the United States reneges on its pledge. The result could be that the Paris agreement unravels, taking it from the 97 percent of global emissions currently covered by the pact to little more than the European Union’s 10 percent share. In addition, Mr. Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency probably will stop work on regulations of methane emissions (a very potent greenhouse gas) from existing oil and gas operations. Undoing complex existing regulations, such as the Clean Power Plan, will be more difficult, but a reconstituted Supreme Court will probably help President Trump when that plan inevitably comes before the court. Also, the new president will most likely ask that the Keystone XL pipeline permit application be renewed — and facilitate other oil and gas pipelines around the country. On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump promised to “bring back” the coal industry by cutting environmental regulations. That may not be so easy. The decline of that industry and related employment has been caused by technological changes in mining, and competition from low-priced natural gas for electricity generation, not by environmental regulations. At the same time, Mr. Trump has pledged to promote fracking for oil and gas, but that would make natural gas even more economically attractive, and accelerate the elimination of coal-sector jobs. If he lives up to his campaign rhetoric, Mr. Trump may indeed be able to reverse course on climate change policy, increasing the threat to our planet, and in the process destroy much of the Obama legacy in this important realm. This will make the states even more important players on this critical issue.  By  Dani Rodrik  The real costs of a Donald J. Trump presidency will most likely come on the political rather than on the economic side. We are likely to see some rise in trade barriers and unilateral economic policies. But for all his bluster, I do not expect Mr. Trump to engage in indiscriminate protectionism. We live in a world of supply chains where imposing tariffs on Mexican or Chinese imports will raise costs of United States businesses and make it hard for them to compete. Mr. Trump is a businessman, and he will understand soon, if he does not now, the senselessness of blanket protectionism. We may have plenty of trade disputes with foreign countries. It’s useful to bear in mind here the example of the 1980s, when trade frictions with Japan and other leading exporters produced a slew of so-called new protectionist barriers such as voluntary export restraints. But these did very limited damage to the world economy. Before long, the world embarked on a further and more intense round of globalization. Furthermore, we have robust international institutions, like the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization, that did not exist in the interwar period. And the political lobbies in favor of an open economy (big business and banks) are stronger and retain considerable influence in Washington. So even though the 1930s parallel is on everyone’s mind, I do not think we are in for a collapse of the international economic order and a retreat into trade war. The real danger Mr. Trump poses is the undermining of our politics — the norms that sustain our liberal democracies. His campaign was based on a divisive politics of identity. Ideals of equity, equal rights, diversity and inclusion were submerged under the weight of a rhetoric that raised racial and ethnic tensions and inflamed passions against imagined enemies — Mexican immigrants, Chinese exporters, Muslim refugees. Illiberal democracy has been the bane of several nations around the world. Under Mr. Trump, the traditions in the United States of checks and balances and of rule of law will be tested seriously. The political danger will be greatly magnified by Mr. Trump’s likely economic failure. He comes into office as the putative leader of middle and lower classes who feel they have been left behind. He has raised their expectations in ways that he cannot meet. There is little chance that incomes at the middle and lower end of income distribution will receive a large boost under his policies. The manufacturing jobs that have left will not return no matter how tough Mr. Trump’s trade policies get. These jobs have disappeared for good, largely thanks to technological changes, and not trade. When the full scale of his economic disappointment sinks in sometime during his term, Mr. Trump may well react in the time-honored fashion of global populists like President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. To keep his base mobilized and insulate himself from economic troubles, he may take shelter in an intensified form of the identity politics that worked so well for him during the presidential campaign. This would rip American society further apart along racial and ethnic cleavages. The ugliness that characterized politics during the presidential campaign may be nothing compared with what may be yet to come.  By  Teresa Tritch  Financial markets regained their footing on Wednesday, as investors and traders apparently concluded that a Donald Trump presidency might not be so bad after all. Instead of focusing on how unprepared Mr. Trump is to be president, several traders quoted in the media talked about how deregulation from ending Obamacare and the Dodd-Frank financial reforms — two Republican goals — could lift stock prices for health care companies and banks. They took special solace in Mr. Trump’s promise to boost government spending on infrastructure and in the measured tones of his acceptance speech. Unfortunately, there is no escaping the overarching conclusion that Mr. Trump’s campaign promises, if carried out, would harm the economy. His proposed rollback of Dodd-Frank reforms would invite renewed recklessness. His opposition to Obamacare would renew and intensify households’ financial insecurity. His proposed tax cuts for the rich would exacerbate income inequality, while either blowing a hole in the deficit or requiring deep budget cuts. His stance on trade would impair international commerce and cooperation. His proposed deportation of immigrants would unleash a legal and humanitarian crisis. Even his popular call for more infrastructure spending is flawed. In and of itself, Mr. Trump’s pledge to borrow vast sums to spend on infrastructure would be a sensible move at this time of low interest rates. But vastly increased federal indebtedness in addition to his other harmful economic policies would be piling risk on top of risk. Risk-taking that crosses the line into recklessness can be immensely profitable in the short run, which is what many traders care most about. But it is no way to run an economy on which everyone else depends for long-term prosperity.  By  Emily Bazelon  Now it looks like a warning shot. When Justice Antonin Scalia died in February, Donald Trump was among the first to call for stonewalling President Obama’s choice to fill the seat. “It’s called delay, delay, delay,” he said at the opening of the Republican presidential debate on Feb. 13. Senator Harry Reid, the minority leader, countered that it would be “unprecedented in recent history” for the Supreme Court to go a year without a full complement of justices. But other Republicans, chief among them the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, agreed with Mr. Trump and Senator Ted Cruz: Justice Scalia’s seat should remain vacant until after the election. Undeterred (what else was he supposed to be?), President Obama nominated Merrick Garland, a seasoned judge praised in the past by Republicans like Senator Orrin Hatch. A debate ensued over historical facts, which seems quaintly polite in retrospect. Since 1900, had the Senate ever refused to confirm a nominee in a presidential election year as a result of the impending election? The answer was no (even if Mr. Cruz tried to argue, against the facts, that Justice Anthony Kennedy wasn’t confirmed in the election year of 1988.) The Republicans’ refusal to grant Judge Garland a hearing or schedule a vote was in fact unprecedented. It was a new kind of hardball. And it succeeded. For a blip in August, Republicans took a hit in the polls for  obstructing the Garland nomination. But the moment passed, blown away in the chaos and battle of the presidential election. Judge Garland slipped from view. The parties adapted to a new reality in which both expected either his postelection, pre-inauguration confirmation, or a new nominee chosen by the next president. When they assumed Hillary Clinton would win, Republicans including Senators John McCain of Arizona  and Richard Burr of North Carolina talked about blocking Democratic Supreme Court picks indefinitely. Both were re-elected Tuesday and will return to a Senate still controlled by the Republicans. It’s hard to see how any Republican paid a price for radically altering the norms for Supreme Court appointments. Mr. Trump helped point the way, and the voters rewarded him and those who followed. Choosing a justice in Antonin Scalia’s mold, as he has promised, will allow Mr. Trump to prove himself to the social conservatives for whom the court, and Roe v. Wade, are the defining issues. Under the current rules, Democrats could filibuster his choice, but if that happens, how long will those rules last? 
Mr. Trump’s election has already run over far stronger traditions and norms. Next comes the question of how many additional Supreme Court appointments will come his way. Ruth Bader Ginsburg is 83. Anthony Kennedy is 80. Stephen Breyer is 78. In Supreme Court terms, four years is a long time.  By  Peter Wehner  To say that Donald Trump’s victory was a shock may qualify as the understatement of the century. The polls were wrong. The experts were wrong. I was wrong. Almost everyone was wrong — including those in the Trump campaign who expected to lose. His victory wasn’t just a surprise; it was an event of gigantic dimensions, its radiating effects incalculable. Mr. Trump’s win ranks among the most unlikely and stunning elections in American history. Regardless of how the Trump presidency turns out, this race will be studied a century from now. For those of us who have been vehement critics of Mr. Trump, this is a rather challenging moment. Starting on Jan. 20, he will be the only president we have. He now has a democratic legitimacy we may regret but cannot deny, and there is such a thing as democratic grace. To those who are tempted only to rage and attack and lament what has occurred, a word of counsel to them, and to myself: We need to give Mr. Trump the chance to rise to the moment, as unlikely as we think that may be. At the same time, we can’t possibly erase the history of the last 17 months — the words he said, the things he did, the conspiracy theories he wove, the ignorance, volatility and cruelty he showed — and our concerns aren’t going to evaporate now that he’s about to be in charge of the nuclear triad that during the campaign he didn’t even know existed. I believed, and still believe, that he is a man with a disordered personality and authoritarian tendencies. My job is to give him a chance to prove me wrong; his job is to prove me wrong. Among my worries is that Mr. Trump’s victory will validate his style of politics, his serrated rhetoric. The way he mistreats people will be normalized. This election has brought us to dark places. Rather than this approach being repudiated it will, for many, become a model. “All the decent drapery of life is to be rudely torn off,” in the words of Edmund Burke. If the Trump campaign foreshadows his presidency, America under Trump will be fundamentally different than it has been — coarser, less temperate and civilized, more inward and resentful. The Republican Party will fundamentally change, from a conservative party to one that champions European-style ethnic nationalism. (The Democratic Party, whose members were certain Hillary Clinton would win, will be convulsed as it enters a period of intense recrimination.) A few hours after Mr. Trump was declared the winner, I received a note from a friend of mine, the distinguished Christian writer Philip Yancey, who told me, “I’m surprised and befuddled, but not scared, thanks to the checks-and-balances strength of American democracy. I tremble, though, to think what an unpredictable leader offers to a world in growing crisis.” He added, “Some say God moves in mysterious ways.  I say, God grants humans the freedom to move in even more mysterious ways.” What happened on Nov. 8th was a mystery that may lead to calamity. I hope to God it won’t.  By  Anna North  I spent the days leading up to the election in Pennsylvania talking to some young voters , 18, 19, 20 years old. They wore flowered Doc Martens, fake fur coats, earbuds dangling from one ear. Overwhelmingly, they were open and polite. They were smart. They were angry at a political system they felt ignored them, but they hoped for better days ahead. In January, Donald Trump will be their next president. Many of these young people supported Mr. Trump. Many did so reluctantly. One young Trump supporter told me that no one knows exactly what Mr. Trump will do in office. Another described hesitating while filling out his absentee ballot, wondering if he could vote for a man who had made abhorrent comments about women. But some voted for Mr. Trump enthusiastically. Those who supported Hillary Clinton were disgusted by Mr. Trump and what he stands for. Today, they’re dealing with a new reality they didn’t expect. I’m thinking of Bria Blackshear, a 20-year-old Temple University student who had waited more than an hour at her polling place in north Philadelphia. “Donald Trump doesn’t represent the ideals I would want for this country,” she said. I’m thinking of Brooke Renner, 18, also a Temple student, who was waiting in line for a second time. She’d given up earlier, but was back and willing to wait as long as it took to cast her vote for Mrs. Clinton. Otherwise, she said, “I’d feel personally responsible if Donald Trump wins.” I’m thinking of Sierra Taylor, a 19-year-old student at the Community College of Philadelphia, who said, “black people feel like our votes don’t matter.” I’m thinking of her friend Naiya Johnson, 22, who, when asked about her hopes for the next four years, said, “I hope we make it.” I’m also thinking of the young people I saw debating the issues that matter to them. Of the table full of young men at Bucks County Community College arguing about Mr. Trump when one, the quietest, spoke up to say, “Trump has no respect for women.” Of the young man, who, as his friend criticized Mrs. Clinton’s record as secretary of state, interjected that Mr. Trump is racist, sexist and xenophobic. They’d had the argument once before, they said. I hope they keep talking. I think they will. It’s a frightening time to grow up. But these young voters are clear-eyed about the shortcomings of government and optimistic enough to imagine a better world. They can make friends with people of different viewpoints, and, when it matters, they can challenge their friends to think in a new way.  By  Seamus McGraw  BRODHEADSVILLE, Pa. — Thinking back now, I can’t for the life of me figure out how I got it so wrong. He seemed so troubled by what he was about to do, as if he knew it was a mistake, but one he felt compelled to make. The way I read the pained look on his face, I thought he was almost apologizing; maybe seeking a kind of absolution. It was just a few days before the election, and I had been canvassing for the Democrats. I wasn’t out there because I was a particularly ardent Clinton supporter. She had certainly not been my first choice, my second or even my third. I’m one of those middle-aged white men without a college degree who had been holding out for Joe Biden to change his mind. But I felt as if I had an obligation to make certain that, at least in my little corner of Pennsylvania, a man who was, to my mind, so obviously unsuited to the highest office in the world, was not just defeated, but repudiated. I expected that my neighbors and friends and the strangers down the road would do just that. Sure, I could feel and even share their frustration over the fact that the longest postwar economic recovery had left so many of my neighbors behind. I had been left behind, too. And yes, I understood the fear of an uncertain world, and the stress of profound cultural changes that were upending so many things that my neighbors took as bedrock values. But I thought the character traits that had always defined the people I knew in eastern Pennsylvania — true conservatives with a sense of responsibility and decency — would in the end lead them to reject “Trumpism,” whatever that actually is. My job wasn’t to help Clinton win. I thought — or at least the pundits were telling me — that was a done deal. The way I saw it, my only task was to drive up her margins and to do that, I was working off a carefully curated list of likely Clinton voters thoughtfully provided to me by the local campaign office. And so when I knocked on this gentleman’s door on a back road in the rural, conservative West End of Monroe County, and he told me that he was indeed planning on voting for Donald Trump, I was ready to simply turn away. But he wouldn’t let me go. “I just can’t trust her,” he said. He made eye contact and kept it. Relentlessly. He and I were of the same rough demographic. Just like me, he was well into his 50s, with teeth that had seen better days. Just like me, he was lower middle class, judging from his surroundings. And as he rattled off a list of shopworn talking points — Benghazi, emails, pay for play — I felt as if I was hearing a stranger’s confession. I felt as if he wanted me to understand and forgive him for what he was about to do. I remember thinking to myself that when this was over, I was going to have to find a way to build a bridge back to this guy who was, in so many ways, just like me. Such was my arrogance. Late last night, as I watched Pennsylvania turn red for the first time in a generation, I kept thinking back to that man, and how I so misread his expression and his words. It wasn’t sorrow etched in his face. It was pity. For me. Because he knew, long before I did, how wrong I was.  —  Seamus McGraw is the author of “Betting the Farm on a Drought.”   By  Beverly Gage  In his victory speech last night, Donald J. Trump paid homage to “the forgotten men and women of our country,” vowing that they “will be forgotten no longer.” This essential political idea — that a vast segment of the nation’s white citizens have been overlooked, or looked down upon — has driven every major realignment in American politics since the New Deal. In 1932, at the darkest moment of the Great Depression, Franklin Roosevelt evoked the “forgotten man” as a reason to rebuild the economy from the “bottom up.” More than three decades later, after Richard Nixon’s 1968 victory, the journalist Peter Schrag identified the “Forgotten American” — the white “lower middle class” voter — as the key to the nation’s apparent rejection of the Great Society and the New Deal order. “In the guise of the working class — or the American yeoman or John Smith — he was once the hero of the civic books, the man that Andrew Jackson called ‘the bone and sinew of the country,’ ” Mr. Schrag wrote. “Now he is ‘the forgotten man,’ perhaps the most alienated person in America.” That this “forgotten” American could be used both to uphold and to dismantle liberalism suggests that this American political identity has never been especially fixed: Democrat or Republican, liberal or conservative, but populist above all. Since the 1960s, the phrase has also implied that the country was paying too much attention to the wrong sorts of people — most notably, to African-Americans — at the expense of the white working class.
It is no coincidence that the “forgotten men and women of our country” began their migration into the Republican Party at the very moment that African-Americans were asserting their right to vote, and voting Democratic, in large numbers for the first time. Mr. Trump’s victory will go down as one of the great upsets in United States history, but it is also the product of a long and bitter struggle over race and class in this country. The Yale sociologist William Graham Sumner is often credited with coining the term “forgotten man.” Writing near the dawn of the Progressive Era, he lamented the lost autonomy of hard-working citizens suddenly forced to pay for high-flown programs of social reform. Sumner’s most famous political essay, “What the Social Classes Owe to Each Other,” rejected the very idea that government might mitigate class antagonisms by sharing the social wealth. What did social classes owe to each other? Not much, in Sumner’s view. And his “forgotten man” owed the least of all. In his 1932 campaign for the presidency, Roosevelt sought to claim the term for a different and more expansive purpose. “These unhappy times call for the building of plans that rest upon the forgotten,” he said in a radio address from Albany in April 1932, for plans “that build from the bottom up and not from the top down, that put their faith once more in the forgotten man at the bottom of the economic pyramid.” To Roosevelt, the “forgotten man” encompassed the industrial worker and struggling farmer and Keynesian consumer — ordinary citizens without whom a modern economy would falter. He built the New Deal around this image, establishing the minimum wage, Social Security and the federal right to organize unions. Those reforms cemented the loyalty of the white working class to the Democratic Party for a generation. But the New Deal also “forgot” — or excluded — many people, including African-Americans. When the Great Society came along, Lyndon Johnson tried to make up for that by expanding federal programs serving the poor and by championing the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts. As the country started to “remember” its long-delayed promises of equality, however, the “forgotten American” began to emerge as term of exclusion and resistance to change. “There is hardly a language to describe him, or even a set of social statistics,” Mr. Schrag wrote in his August 1969 essay, “ The Forgotten American .” “Just names: racist-bigot-redneck-ethnic-Irish-Italian-Pole-Hunkie-Yahoo. The lower middle class. A blank.” As Mr. Schrag noted, all of that name-calling was part of the problem, a refusal on the part of liberal elites to recognize the real grievances and desires of what had once been a bedrock Democratic constituency. In the 1968 campaign, Nixon capitalized on this resentment with calls for “law and order,” a phrase that evoked not only fears of crime, but also anger at protesters and rioters and the college-campus liberals who tolerated them. Mr. Trump put that phrase back into political circulation in 2016, a gesture of solidarity with the old ways of thinking about the “silent majority” — and the “forgotten American.” And though he included “men and women” in his victory speech, Mr. Trump’s campaign mobilized around the same image that once animated the Roosevelt coalition: the “forgotten” white working-class man. Race, too, remains an indelible part of today’s conversation about who has been “forgotten” and who deserves to be seen. To dismiss this language as simple racism, however, is to miss at least some of its political significance. What happened in the late 1960s and 1970s was not only that the Republican Party reclaimed and redefined Roosevelt’s “forgotten man” for a more conservative age. During those years, the Democratic Party itself began to turn away from the New Deal and its working-class politics, especially from its commitment to organized labor. With Mr. Trump’s election, we may be witnessing the rise of a new party system, with the Democrats now the standard-bearers of racial tolerance and free-market globalization, and the Republicans the party of nationalist populist revolt. But as Roosevelt showed, this need not be a fixed political equation. If the 2016 election marks the final, gasping end of the New Deal coalition, it should also mark the start of a new reckoning within the Democratic Party.  By  Helen Lewis  LONDON — You can’t throw a peanut in a Westminster pub without hitting an obsessive follower of American politics. Start a conversation about “The West Wing” with any member of Parliament and expect to get a long disquisition on that American political drama’s best episodes. During Britain’s last general election, in 2015, both main political parties here proudly boasted about being advised by veterans of Barack Obama’s campaign. Until now, our Americophilia has been unrequited. Then in August, Donald J. Trump declared himself “Mr. Brexit.” For Mr. Trump and his supporters, Britain’s vote in June to leave the European Union was evidence of a growing popular revolt against multiculturalism, porous borders and political elites. If the British electorate could deliver a result that baffled its financial sector, its scientists and metropolitan liberals – and was not widely predicted by pollsters – couldn’t the same sort of upset happen in America? It just did. Mr. Trump’s victory feels like a flashback to June, although where Brexit divided members of Britain’s political class, the American election results have united them. Politicians of the mainstream right and left alike are dumbfounded that the United States  would elect someone who uses the extreme language Mr. Trump does and who seems to have little love for institutions like NATO. Last December, Britain’s former Conservative prime minister, David Cameron, described Mr. Trump’s proposed ban on Muslims entering America as “divisive, stupid and wrong.” The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan of the Labour Party, has called the president-elect’s views on Islam “ignorant.” Apart from Nigel Farage, the face of the far-right U.K. Independence Party, it is difficult to find a British politician with a good word to say about Mr. Trump. Nationalism, white anger and protectionism are now driving politics in Britain and across Europe. The sound is of doors slamming. Brexit felt like a referendum on border control, and on rapid demographic change among white communities that felt themselves deprived of attention and resources. It is tempting to draw comparisons with the United States: The big cities in both Britain and the United States, which are most diverse, are also most relaxed about that diversity. In smaller communities, immigration feels more disruptive. There are other parallels. Mr. Trump’s victory was driven by older, white voters, who were struggling but not destitute. He won white men without college degrees by a landslide. A typical Leave supporter has a similar demographic profile. Such voters are on the decline, as both Britain and the United States become more diverse and younger generations are better-educated, and more open to immigration and change. But as both the Brexit vote and Mr. Trump’s victory showed, they are far from a spent force.  By  Susan Chira  Women, as Hillary Clinton showed this morning , know how to absorb pain. And Mrs. Clinton has had plenty of practice about how to stand before the cameras after public humiliation. Clearly, she needed time to compose herself. She made no appearances overnight, instead calling Donald J. Trump to concede. But when she strode onstage in purple and gray, Bill Clinton behind her in a purple tie, her voice did not waver. Women seldom have the luxury of giving in to pain. Many have children or grandchildren or aging parents to tend, whether they themselves are sick or in emotional turmoil. So Mrs. Clinton faced her despondent campaign staff and her despondent half of the country and tried to rally them. She spoke most directly to young people, and to women and girls. She had hoped to stand before them as a symbol of all that women could achieve. Now she had to demonstrate once again what women can endure. “I’ve had successes and setbacks, sometimes really painful ones,” she told them. It was hard not to recall her standing beside Bill Clinton after the whole world knew graphic and humiliating details about the affairs he had denied having. “To all the women and especially the young women who put their faith in me I want you to know that nothing has made me prouder than to be your champion,” she said, and here she had to clear her throat. “I know we still have not shattered that highest and hardest glass ceiling but some day somebody will, and hopefully sooner than we might think right now.” It’s difficult to know right now all that stood in the way of shattering that ceiling. Was it a woman, or this woman? Was it Mrs. Clinton as symbol of the Washington establishment, as a consummate insider in a time of profound distrust of the elite? We do know that voters disproportionately punish women who are seen as dishonest. We do know that it’s hard for strong, assertive and ambitious women to be seen as likable and competent at the same time. Political scientists and cultural commentators will long debate what happened in this election, to this woman and to many women.  The question is whether the image of Mrs. Clinton, composed and gracious in defeat, persevering through pain, will inspire women to try again?  By  Felix Salmon  Markets always move after seismic events, like the unexpected election of Donald J. Trump. Still, market moves need to be interpreted. Even if you believe that markets are right, it’s not always obvious what they’re saying. One way to think about the market’s gyrations is the idea of mean and variation. When Barack Obama (a.k.a. No Drama Obama) was elected president, it was possible to anticipate — correctly, it turned out — that he would help steer America back onto a course of steady growth, low inflation and falling unemployment. Think of that as the Obama mean: the baseline expectation. When the stock market expects good things like that, it tends to rise, just as it has during the Obama presidency. But the variation is just as important as the mean. Mr. Obama didn’t always give the markets what they wanted, but by the same token he was always clear about what he was going to do. He promised them something much more valuable: a low-risk upward economic trajectory. Mr. Trump is the exact opposite of Mr. Obama. His baseline is worse, for starters: to establish expectations for his presidency, you have to factor in his hugely irresponsible fiscal policy, potential trade wars and maybe even reckless brinkmanship over repaying the national debt. Put those things together, and a severe recession becomes possible. But it gets even worse because Mr. Trump is by his nature highly unpredictable. However bad you think he’s going to be, it’s entirely possible that your prediction will turn out to be ridiculously optimistic. Mr. Trump has vastly more downside risk than Mr. Obama ever had, and so markets are going to trade at a discount to his already-discounted baseline. If you transition, then, from low-risk positive expectations to high-risk negative expectations, you have to expect the markets to take some precipitous plunges along the way. Much of that will be noise. The markets always fluctuate randomly in the short term, and there’s no point in trying to read anything meaningful into those moves. That’s why it’s dangerous to read too much into midnight stock-market futures trading, or a sudden plunge in the value of the Mexican peso once it becomes obvious that Mr. Trump will become president. Those moves might be a rational response to the lower expected value of the assets in question. On the other hand, they might just be the result of panicky hedging — or indeed they could simply represent dealers second-guessing and trying to outmaneuver one another. Once the market has been trading steadily for a few months, its general direction under the auspices of the new government is going to be pretty clear. Fluctuations over just a few hours, by contrast, are much harder to read. They might look like signals — but all too often they turn out to be nothing but noise. And as we’ve learned during this long, brutal election, separating noise from signals can be a very tricky business.  By  Michael Lerner  It turns out that shaming the supporters of Donald J. Trump is not a good political strategy. Though job loss and economic stagnation played a role in his victory, so did shame. As the principal investigator on a study of the middle class for the National Institute of Mental Health, I found that working people’s stress is often intensified by shame at their failure to “make it” in what they are taught is a meritocratic American economy. The right has been very successful at persuading working people that they are vulnerable not because they themselves have failed, but because of the selfishness of some other villain (African-Americans, feminists, immigrants, Muslims, Jews, liberals, progressives; the list keeps growing). Instead of challenging this ideology of shame, the left has buttressed it by blaming white people as a whole for slavery, genocide of the Native Americans and a host of other sins, as though whiteness itself was something about which people ought to be ashamed. The rage many white working-class people feel in response is rooted in the sense that once again, as has happened to them throughout their lives, they are being misunderstood. So please understand what is happening here. Many Trump supporters very legitimately feel that it is they who have been facing an unfair reality. The upper 20 percent of income earners, many of them quite liberal and rightly committed to the defense of minorities and immigrants, also believe in the economic meritocracy and their own right to have so much more than those who are less fortunate. So while they may be progressive on issues of discrimination against the obvious victims of racism and sexism, they are blind to their own class privilege and to the hidden injuries of class that are internalized by much of the country as self-blame. The right’s ability to portray liberals as elitists is further strengthened by the phobia toward religion that prevails in the left. Many religious people are drawn by the teachings of their tradition to humane values and caring about the oppressed. Yet they often find that liberal culture is hostile to religion of any sort, believing it is irrational and filled with hate. People on the left rarely open themselves to the possibility that there could be a spiritual crisis in society that plays a role in the lives of many who feel misunderstood and denigrated by the fancy intellectuals and radical activists. The left needs to stop ignoring people’s inner pain and fear. The racism, sexism and xenophobia used by Mr. Trump to advance his candidacy does not reveal an inherent malice in the majority of Americans. If the left could abandon all this shaming, it could rebuild its political base by helping Americans see that much of people’s suffering is rooted in the hidden injuries of class and in the spiritual crisis that the global competitive marketplace generates. Democrats need to become as conscious and articulate about the suffering caused by classism as we are about other forms of suffering. We need to reach out to Trump voters in a spirit of empathy and contrition. Only then can we help working people understand that they do not live in a meritocracy, that their intuition that the system is rigged is correct (but it is not by those whom they had been taught to blame) and that their pain and rage is legitimate."
"","Advertisement  By  The New York Times  How the election and Donald Trump’s victory looks to Opinion writers.  By  Samuel J. Abrams  With Election Day finally here, we can all agree that 2016 will be one for the history books: measured by emotional drain, public vitriol, and the intense focus on the candidates’ personalities over substantive policy issues, Americans have never seen an election like this. But when the dust settles, will the tone and tenor of it have meant anything for the way we practice politics? This isn’t an idle question. After all, the tenor of a campaign has little to do with the impact of the election. Remember 2004? For all the personal baggage and allegations slung at John Kerry, along with the vapors about American politics’ reaching a new low that year, nothing happened. The same with the positive messaging of Barack Obama in 2008 — little changed and our politics continued to appear deeply divided. But 2016 has indeed been transformational, above all for the two major parties. At least since 1992, we have watched the Democrats and Republicans entrench themselves deeper and deeper in their extreme wings. This quarter-century drift produced significant electoral instability: Presidential victories have been razor thin, and partisan control in Congress and in the White House has flipped back and forth with regularity. It’s easy to forget that it wasn’t always like this. From 1896 through 1930, there was stable G.O.P. control over Congress, which flipped to the Democrats from the Depression through 1952. After 1952, the country entered a period of divided but stable government, with the Republicans usually dominating the White House and Democrats governing in Congress. Back then, the parties fought to occupy the center and appeal to as many citizens as possible in order to win elections. We entered a new era of instability in 1992 with the rise of Newt Gingrich-style partisanship and an empowered party elite — megadonors, activists, politicos — all of which shifted toward the extremes to appeal to their core ideological loyalists. In doing so, the parties not only became more ideologically distinct, but they also pushed away their centrist supporters and overreached their electoral mandates, pushing for divisive, narrow agendas. This left the average American voter feeling angry, dissatisfied and increasingly disconnected from politics. And now, 2016 may well be the breaking point: Both parties had become so narrow and so reliant on their hard-core loyalists that they left themselves vulnerable to powerful revolts on their very extremes. Thanks to social media and the ability to fund-raise and organize outside the traditional power structures, 2016 saw populist insurgencies on the left and right — insurgencies by voters on the outer edges of each party who do not necessarily represent the needs and desires of the average voter. The G.O.P. collapsed entirely as an institution and will be in a fight over its identity and outlook for the foreseeable future. For the Democrats, while Hillary Clinton ultimately defeated Bernie Sanders, the progressive movement fought the Clinton machine well into the primaries and revealed deep fractures and unaddressed concerns within the Democratic Party. The populist message shifted the agenda for Mrs. Clinton away from her previously more centrist message — and will continue, as Mr. Sanders and others, like Senator Elizabeth Warren, may very well continue their movement and message. Regardless of who wins the election, the victorious party will have an important decision to make: Will it take the victory as a mandate to pursue a divisive agenda supported by its most extreme elements in hopes of pandering to the loyalist base, at the risk of further alienating moderate voters? Or will it take a more centrist approach in an effort to solidify its appeal for re-election in 2020? After the rocky election cycle in 2016, I’d bet that the winning party will end up pursuing a more moderate agenda than whatever its current election platform promises, in an effort to shore up popular support for its presidency; there is simply too much fertile electoral ground in the middle to leave fallow. The losing party will have to do likewise if it wants to stay competitive. It may be messy for a while, and only time will tell how the parties change. But one thing is clear: In 2016, the elites lost their monopoly power, and the 24 years of parties’ pandering to increasingly narrow bases is coming to an end. Perhaps in 2096, historians will look back on 1992 to 2016 as a strange 24-year blip in what has otherwise been a relatively stable and centrist 300 years of American political history.  By  Daniel K. Williams  Donald J. Trump was elected with a higher percentage of the white evangelical vote than any other Republican presidential candidate has ever received, and he has received strong support from prominent Christian Right leaders. Yet if Mr. Trump delivers on his promises, he will not give the religious right what its leaders have traditionally demanded or what the Republican Party platform calls for. Indeed, he will give them very little national legislation at all, but will instead offer them maximum latitude to pursue their agenda at the state level — a shift that may portend a potential breakthrough in the nation’s polarizing culture wars. National legislation has long been the goal of the religious right. When the movement emerged in the late 1970s, evangelical leaders such as Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson sought federal constitutional amendments to ban abortion and restore school prayer, because they wanted to reverse what liberal rights activists had done at the national level through the Supreme Court. In the early 21st century, leaders such as James Dobson continued this trend by persuading   President George W. Bush to endorse a constitutional amendment proposal to define marriage as exclusively heterosexual. In recent years, evangelicals have become so concerned about protecting their own religious liberty against federal mandates or court decisions that they have given less attention to imposing a moral agenda on the rest of the nation. Although the Republican Party platform continues to promise a constitutional amendment protecting human life from the moment of conception, the pro-life movement has not made any serious attempts to pass that amendment since the 1980s. Nor has there been much talk in the last decade of a national ban on same-sex marriage. Mr. Trump is well positioned to promote a further shift away from national moral regulation. For much of his adult life, he held culturally libertarian views on abortion and gay rights, and he evinced little interest in the religious right’s agenda. Early in his campaign, he expressed discomfort with conservative evangelicals’ opposition to the rights of transgender people to use the public restroom of their choice. But he quickly came to embrace a “states’ rights” position on same-sex marriage and transgender rights, a position that would allow culturally liberal New Yorkers the right to pursue different policies than cultural conservatives in Mississippi or North Dakota. And while Mr. Trump stumbled over abortion during his campaign, the policy that he ultimately reverted to was to leave abortion legalization up to the states — an outcome that he would try to ensure by nominating conservative Supreme Court justices who might overturn Roe v. Wade. Mr. Trump has gone further than any previous Republican presidential nominee in a generation in insisting that the religious right should enact its agenda at the state, rather than federal, level.  Although this was the policy position of many Republicans during the 1970s (including President Gerald Ford), religious right activists persuaded the G.O.P. in the early 1980s to abandon its states-rights approach to abortion and other social issues, and promise national legislation to implement the religious right’s agenda. Mr. Trump is leading the party back to its more traditional stance. While many liberals will find this outcome unsatisfactory — since it offers them no opportunity to secure national protection for individual rights that they consider inalienable — it may be the only compromise solution that can give both conservatives and liberals the freedom to pursue their own agenda at the local level without fear of a national backlash. If a socially libertarian New Yorker can deliver this compromise to the conservative white rural evangelical voters who put him in office, both conservatives and liberals should see that for what it is: a landmark opportunity to move beyond the culture wars.  By  Marwan Bishara  Just when the people of the Middle East thought things couldn’t get any worse, Donald J. Trump is elected president of the United States. Now, their apprehension about the president-elect dwarfs their disappointment with President Obama. It could be a blessing in disguise. America, in one magic moment, you’ve revealed how you’ve changed. For the worse. Poor you, you feel so insecure, vulnerable and fragile. Like the rest of us. So, instead of reaching for your famed “can-do” spirit, lifting yourselves up by the bootstraps, you turned to a strident, bellicose type of nationalism. The kind usually associated with strutting generalissimos of Third World nations with their chests covered with made-up, self-awarded medals. Maybe the people of the Middle East will look and realize that you are no longer the Great Democracy to emulate. That your modern style of empire and your role as keeper of the world order for the world’s own good are stumbling and failing, even in your own eyes; and that we in the Middle East should not be turning to you for rescue. For as long as I can remember, you’ve been on a self-assigned mission to change the Middle East. Indeed, the world. Now, it seems as if the change has flowed the other way. You’ve voted to reduce your liberties. To narrow the range of people entitled to justice and equality before the law. To live in a place where the police should not be criticized; where fighting political correctness is more important than fighting racism; where Muslims are suspected and people who appear Hispanic can be rounded up if they’re not carrying their papers. In this election you’ve revealed that your people — like Russians, Hungarians, Iraqis, Iranians and others whose politics you normally look down on — will choose a narrow, nonsensical nationalist ethos when they feel threatened by uncertainty. Your imperial outreach allowed you to experience other cultures, but now you’ve chosen to shrink your outlook, with the expectation that the world will continue to revolve around you. It won’t. Like the rest of us, you’re now divided between those who want to make their nation great again alone and those who want to make it great together. O.K., enough about you; let’s talk about us. We in the Middle East can’t decipher what exactly your incoming president wants from us. I don’t think he knows, either. Mr. Trump said he would bring back torture and ban Muslims from entering America, and he compared the threat of “radical Islam” to Soviet Communism. He wants less engagement in the region, and fewer “free riders” like the Saudis who don’t pay enough for American protection. And he wants the United States to abandon the costly nation-building in the Middle East. What nation-building? In Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Yemen, Libya and Somalia, civil wars continue unabated. The Arab and Muslim worlds only hope the United States stops contributing to the destruction.
Mr. Trump does not exactly seem concerned for the wishes of Middle Easterners and their right to live in peace. It sounds more like what he really wants to do is pal around with other strutting, authoritarian types. Expect him to cozy up to Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, and join him in supporting Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad. Expect America’s new president to work closely with Egypt’s president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, and Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. Mr. Trump has embraced Mr. Netanyahu’s positions on Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and on abandoning the two-state solution. Instead of Americanizing the Middle East, Mr. Trump seems set on “Israelizing” America, stirring fear of Muslims and trying to wall out “the other.” Arabs, and Middle Easterners in general, should take one quick look and figure out how to be less dependent on the United States, and how to resolve their conflicts within their own, regional frameworks.
Finally, some good news. President Obama has assured us that the sun will rise tomorrow, regardless. And if the Trump presidency is as bad as I expect it to be — though not so bad that it demolishes democracy entirely — he can be voted out in four years. Meanwhile, fasten your seatbelts. It’s going to be a hell of a ride.  By  Carol Giacomo  A commitment to human rights has been a fundamental precept of NATO since the alliance was created a half century ago. You would not expect that a founding member would have to be reminded of that fact. Certainly not the United States, for all those years the leader of NATO and an inspirational embodiment of its core values. Yet this is where we find ourselves now, the day after Donald Trump won the presidency: In congratulating him on his victory, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany felt compelled to set conditions for cooperation. “Germany and America are connected by values of democracy, freedom and respect for the law and the dignity of man, independent of origin, skin color, religion, gender, sexual orientation or political views,” she said in a statement, adding: “I offer the next President of the United States close cooperation on the basis of these values.” Mr. Trump’s behavior during his campaign was antithetical to those values. He has threatened to ban Muslims from the United States, refuse refugees, deport 11 million undocumented workers and build a wall on the border with Mexico. He has disparaged African Americans, Mexican Americans, women and people with disabilities. Moreover, Mr. Trump has called into question America’s commitment to NATO and displayed a befuddling penchant for defending Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, who is waging war in eastern Ukraine and destabilizing other parts of Europe by supporting far-right groups. He received no pushback on Wednesday from Theresa May, the British prime minister, who simply congratulated Mr. Trump on his win. The two leaders’ reactions were further proof that, after Britain’s decision to leave the European Union, we will have to look to Mrs. Merkel not just to lead Europe but to replace America in leading NATO as well.  By  Gil Troy  “I am scared that if Ronald Reagan gets into office, we are going to see more of the Ku Klux Klan and a resurgence of the Nazi Party,” Coretta Scott King said in November, 1980. “I’m afraid things are going to blow sky high during this next term,” a nursing student said. He’s a “nitwit,” added a Democrat. “He’s shallow, superficial and frightening,” one of that year’s historic numbers of “undecideds” insisted. Ronald Reagan “seems not to relish complexity and subtlety,” the New York Times editorial endorsing President Jimmy Carter’s re-election proclaimed. “The problem is not a loose lip but the simple answer.”  While fearing what Reagan’s own running mate, George H.W. Bush, had dismissed as Reagan’s “voodoo economics” during their primary fight, the editorial board feared “voodoo diplomacy,” too. From coast to coast, half of a divided nation abhorred —  and underestimated — the president-elect. “The American people,“ Hamilton Jordan, a key Carter aide, said, "are not going to elect a 70-year-old, right-wing, ex-movie actor to be president.” Pollsters reported in 1980 that “More voters held negative attitudes toward each presidential candidate than in any campaign since polling began” — a record we just broke in 2016. The economic dislocation of galloping inflation and the energy crisis produced a nasty campaign. Feeling neglected by Washington, millions embraced Ronald Reagan’s populism. Despite the Democratic panic, Ronald Reagan left America richer and safer after two terms as president. Reagan defied expectations by turning toward the center. He acted as president of the United States, not president of the Republican Party. Reagan used the transition period to heal wounds while claiming a broad policy mandate, despite winning only 50.7 percent of the popular vote. He vowed to “rebuild a bipartisan base for American foreign policy.” His cabinet choices were so moderate that Pat Buchanan, the conservative flamethrower whose rhetorical bluster anticipated the advent of Donald Trump, lamented: “Where is the dash, color, and controversy — the customary concomitants of a Reagan campaign?” Just weeks into Reagan’s first term, conservatives were demanding that his aides had to “Let Reagan be Reagan,” meaning: stop being so reasonable. But in adjusting, in tempering, Reagan was being Reagan. He knew the Constitution limited presidential powers — and he faced a Democratic Congress led by the formidable speaker of the House Tip O’Neill to remind him further. Illustrating Richard Neustadt’s lesson that the power of the president is mostly “the power to persuade,” many of Reagan’s achievements were symbolic. Rather than shrinking government as he promised, for example, he only lowered the federal government’s growth rate. History is not destiny. And Reagan had both a lighter touch than Mr. Trump, and eight years’ experience as  governor of California. Still, history is full of shifts and surprises. Mr. Trump must be a healer and unite America, as he tried doing in his victory speech. If he fails, the checks and balances that sometimes help crusading ideologues become effective leaders can ultimately impose a necessary gridlock. When asked about conservatives’ frustration with him, Reagan kindly insisted it was only a “very few” critics. He said: “There are some people who think that you should, on principle, jump off the cliff with the flag flying if you can’t get everything you want.” Reagan recalled that “If I found when I was governor that I could not get 100 percent of what I asked for, I took 80 percent.” So far, Mr. Trump, the political amateur and sputtering demagogue, has lacked Reagan’s magnanimity or his flexibility. Can the reality-show star turned president-elect mimic the actor turned president?  By  James R. Jones  In 1968, there was a demand among voters for change, especially regarding Vietnam and foreign policy, and there was a backlash against some of the Great Society programs. Then, as now, the Democratic candidate was tied to the departing administration and hamstrung to differentiate a new set of policies. As a result, the Democratic presidential nominee, Hubert H. Humphrey, narrowly lost to the Republican, Richard M. Nixon, a candidate who was despised by a large percentage of the electorate. One positive outcome of that election was the first organized transition from the departing to incoming governments. President Lyndon B. Johnson always believed that, after an election, Democrats and Republicans should come together to do what’s right for the country. At the time, I was President Johnson’s appointments secretary, the position that has since evolved into the White House chief of staff. Right after the 1968 results came in, the president put me in charge of organizing a transition process, something that had never been done. “Nixon is an S.O.B., but he’s the only president we’ll have,” Johnson told me. “I want him and all of his team to be fully prepared to govern after the Inauguration at 12 noon on January 20.” A few days later, Johnson and Nixon met at the White House along with Nixon’s top advisers, including H. R. Haldeman and John Mitchell. There we mapped out a program in which all of the Johnson cabinet and major White House staff members would brief their incoming counterparts as often as was desired by the new administration. My charge was to work with Haldeman, who became my successor at the White House, to make sure these briefings occurred across the new administration and in a timely fashion. One surprise was that Nixon told me that Mitchell could speak for him in all matters if he was not available. Johnson would have never delegated such authority, but that was the difference in the management style of the two men. While a smooth transition was important to Johnson, he didn’t stop being president. He was issuing orders and making appointments right up to the morning of the Inauguration. In fact, the day before the Inauguration the president told me to find out how many vacancies existed on commissions and boards and find good people that he could nominate. He kept Nixon waiting in the Blue Room on Inauguration morning while he signed those nominations (which required Senate confirmation) and had them delivered to the Congress before noon. It is a positive sign that President Obama invited Donald J. Trump to meet at the White House two days after this most contentious election. Today transitions are much more institutional now than our first one in 1968. But this process can heal many wounds and start bringing our country closer together. That’s imperative if we want to make our government work for the people again. Back in 1968, Johnson and Nixon left the White House together, along with Senator Everett Dirksen and me. We jumped into the car and headed to the Capitol. Surprisingly, Nixon wanted only to discuss how disappointed he was to have lost Texas (Johnson’s home state) and how determined he was to win it in1972. I hope the ride to the Capitol next January will be more substantive on policy.  By  Sarah Jaffe  If anything has been made clear by the results of this election, it is that the political and pundit class have underestimated the degree of anger and pain in the United States, the degree to which “recovery” has been recovery for a few and stagnation and decline for many more. One exit poll has been haunting me since I saw it: The Reuters/Ipsos early exit poll found that 75 percent of respondents agreed “America needs a strong leader to take the country back from the rich and powerful.” Only slightly fewer agreed that “the American economy is rigged to advantage the rich and powerful,” and — perhaps the kicker — 68 percent believed that “traditional parties and politicians don’t care about people like me.” There’s a lot to unpack in those statements. They may conceal white resentment of the perceived advancement past them of black and Latino people. But they also reveal the sentiment that has been there since the 2008 financial crisis laid bare the lines of power in the country and the world — when, as the protest chant went, “Banks got bailed out, we got sold out.” The downward trends have been with us for decades: the divergence of productivity gains from workers’ incomes, the substitution of credit card debt for raises, the shift of good union jobs and family wages and pensions into low-wage service jobs, and the attendant slashing of the social safety net. But the past eight years sped all that up and made it impossible to ignore. If Donald J. Trump stood out to voters from the rest of the Republican Party, aside from a willingness to say directly the kinds of things usually carefully dogwhistled, it was in his rants about trade and his lack of interest in dismantling the remnants of the welfare state. For white Americans anxiously looking at their disappearing stability, Mr. Trump was a bomb they were willing to throw at a system they felt was failing them. He emotionally echoed their outrage and gave them a place to direct their anger, the age-old right-wing populist trick of refracting it both upward at elites and downward at minorities. Hillary Clinton’s campaign and the mainstream Democratic Party were woefully unprepared to greet this wave. When your response to a cry of “Make America Great Again!” is “America Is Already Great!” you’d better be sure that it feels true to a majority of voters. The results show that it did not. To be sure, Democrats had an uneasy line to walk, between maintaining continuity with a still-popular, twice-elected Barack Obama — a continuity that won Mrs. Clinton the Democratic primary — and reaching the people who wanted and needed change. But the party’s wholehearted backing of Mrs. Clinton was a colossal misreading of a moment when rage at the establishment (of both parties) was simmering everywhere. That rage should have been visible as Mr. Trump ran away with the Republican nomination process despite the opposition of that party’s grandees, and as Bernie Sanders pushed Mrs. Clinton much harder than anyone had expected a gray-haired socialist from Vermont to do. But Mrs. Clinton opened her arms to disaffected Republicans rather than wooing the disaffected within and around her own party. Most of the television ads she ran were more about painting Trump as a dangerous aberration, an outsider unfit for office, than pitching any plan of her own for change. Democrats failed to realize that for many Trump voters, that was exactly what they liked about him.  By  Will Wilkinson  It may not be an exaggeration to say that Donald Trump both knows and cares less about the details of public policy than anyone ever elected president of the United States. This just goes to show that “politics is not about policy,” as Robin Hanson, the futurist and social theorist, likes to say. Mr. Trump’s playbook against Hillary Clinton broke with the hard-won norms of liberal democracy, went back to demagogic, authoritarian political basics, and updated them for  the reality television, social media age. Politics is, at bottom, about factions vying and coordinating to choose leaders in whom to invest authority. Throughout the campaign, Mr. Trump displayed an uncanny and unnerving mastery of the primal politics of authority, and the game of legitimizing his own and delegitimizing his rivals’ claims to authority. In Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump drew a general election opponent pre-weakened by a decades-long Republican campaign of delegitimization. He took advantage of it with shameless audacity, making the most of our culture’s lingering sexism and the popular perception of Mrs. Clinton as a member of an arrogant and corrupt elite that believes it is above the law. But tearing down his opponents was only half of Trump’s equation. The pundits and pollsters so badly botched their predictions in no small part because they failed to grasp the intense, reality-distorting power of Donald Trump’s fame. But Mr. Trump seems to have an intuitive understanding that glamour, celebrity and gaudy wealth are key ingredients in majesty — which is inherently authoritative and underwrites its own claim to legitimacy. Trump’s self-branded personal jet was more than a convenient means of transportation for a very rich man. It was a purple silk, ermine-fringed cape, Air Force One in waiting, and he knew how to use it. The United States, the world’s first nation founded on principled opposition to the pre-Enlightenment politics of majesty and unified authority, has deep-seated norms of republican modesty and propriety. Casting those norms aside and banking heavily on the atavistic political appeal of majestic celebrity gave Mr. Trump an advantage few us were prepared to acknowledge, allowing him to attract the support of an unforeseen numbers of black, Hispanic and female voters, despite his campaign’s naked racism and his scandalously misogynistic and abusive personal history. Because Mr. Trump’s strategy was so indifferent to matters of policy substance, it is incredibly difficult to say what policies Mr. Trump will actually support in office. I don’t think we’ve ever known less about what an incoming president really wants to do with his power. But we do have a clear indication of how he’s likely to wield it. He will cleverly burnish his claim to authority and relentlessly and effectively discredit his opponents, inside and outside the Republican Party, with all the tools of an executive branch that has never been more powerful and less constrained by the constitutional system America’s founders designed specifically as an alternative to and a bulwark against unitary authority.  By  Lindy West  I got up on Election Day and burst into tears — not a genteel twin trickle but a great heaving burst, zero to firehose. Tears spattered the inside of my glasses, dripped from my lips, and left mascara-tinged rosettes blooming black in my cereal milk. “Honey,” my husband crooned to me. “Honey, it’s going to be O.K. The numbers are still good. It’s O.K.” But it wasn’t the numbers. I wasn’t sobbing because I was afraid Hillary Clinton was going to lose. That would come later. I was sobbing Tuesday morning because, as I poured my coffee, I’d caught a glimpse of a cable news interview with Mrs. Clinton just after she voted for herself in Chappaqua, N.Y. She seemed breathless, exhilarated, a little overwhelmed. Over her shoulder, Bill Clinton stared at his wife and beamed. My husband stares at me like that sometimes. It’s not just love — we expect husbands to love their wives — but something less traditional, more conditional and gendered. It’s professional respect. It’s pride. We’re accustomed to that pride flowing the other direction, from wife to husband, because men in our culture get to be more than just bodies, do more than just nurture. Men get to act and excel and climb and aspire and thrive and win and rule and be the audacious, hungry fulcrum of public life. It is normal for men to have ambition. It is normal for women to stand aside. I thought about Bill Clinton meeting Hillary Rodham at Yale in 1971, and how tenacious and intense she must have been even back then, how undeniable and potent. Mr. Clinton describes the moment in his memoir . “She conveyed a sense of strength and self-possession I had rarely seen in anyone, man or woman,“ he wrote. "She was in my face from the start.” He says he once told her , during those years, “I have met all the most gifted people in our generation and you’re the best.” And then I thought about Mr. Clinton rising steadily through his political career, on the track we have built for charismatic, competent white men. He must have known, every second, how good his wife was. Not just good, but “the best.” Better than everyone he’d ever met; better than him, even. And he watched her stand next to him and wait, and wait, and wait, underestimated and degraded and excoriated for wanting more out of life than cookies. And she didn’t quit! She swallowed slander and humiliation and irrational hatred for three decades and she didn’t quit, and here she was, just a hair’s breadth from the presidency of the United States — the first woman ever to be trusted with the rudder of the world. He must be so proud of her, I thought. It made me cry. I cried because I want my daughters to feel that blazing pride, that affirmation of their boundless capacity — not from their husbands, but from their world, from the atmosphere, from inviolable wells of certainty inside themselves. I cried because it’s not fair, and I’m so tired, and every woman I know is so tired. I cried because I don’t even know what it feels like to be taken seriously — not fully, not in that whole, unequivocal, confident way that’s native to handshakes between men. I cried because it does things to you to always come second. Whatever your personal opinion of the Clintons, as politicians or as human beings, that dynamic is real. We, as a culture, do not take women seriously on a profound level. We do not believe women. We do not trust women. We do not like women. I understand that many men cannot see it, and plenty more do not care. I know that many men will read this and laugh, or become defensive, or call me hysterical, or worse, and that’s fine. I am used to it. It doesn’t make me wrong. But maybe this election was the beginning of something new, I thought. Not the death of sexism, but the birth of a world in which women’s inferiority isn’t a given. That grain of hope glowed inside me until around dinner time on Tuesday, the final day of an election so openly misogynist that the question “Sexual assault: good or bad?” was credulously presented for debate. Today doesn’t feel real. It is indistinguishable from fresh, close grief. But if there’s one lesson we can take from Mrs. Clinton, politics aside — and even Donald Trump acknowledged it in the second debate — it’s the limitlessness of human endurance. Those of us who have been left in the cold by this apparent affirmation of a white supremacist patriarchy (and sorry, white women who voted for Mr. Trump, but your shelter is illusory) are tough. We have been weathering this hurricane wall of doubt and violence for so long, and now, more crystalline than ever, we have an enemy and a mandate. We have the smirking apotheosis of our oppression sliming, paw-first, toward our genitals. We have the popular vote. We have proof, in exit polls, that white women will pawn their humanity for the safety of white supremacy. We have abortion pills to stockpile and neighbors to protect and children to teach. We have the right woman to find. We have local elections in a year. The fact that we lost doesn’t make us wrong; the fact that they don’t believe in us doesn’t make us disappear.  By  Seth Grossman  A couple of years ago, I produced a reality-TV show called “Hollywood Hillbillies,” about a family from rural Georgia who, driven by the grandson’s newfound internet fame, moves west to make it in Hollywood. The show centered on the undeniable charisma of “Mema,” the foul-mouthed matriarch who spoke her mind and poked fun at the habits and attitudes of the Los Angeles elite. The show was part of a wave of “redneck reality” shows like “Swamp People,” “Duck Dynasty,” “Bayou Billionaires” and “Moonshiners” that presented a vision of white, rural America as the last authentic place on earth, the last place untarnished by the corruption and cynicism of the elites. “Hollywood Hillbillies” aired on the Reelz Network, a channel owned by a billionaire Republican donor Stanley Hubbard , who funded a pro-Trump “super” PAC after his preferred candidates lost the primaries. Designed as a harmless comedy, the show reveled in Mema’s provocative, off-color remarks, just as Donald J. Trump’s audience revels in his. But now I’m thinking more critically about what shows like this are selling. All of these shows have one thing in common: While trafficking in rural stereotypes, they celebrate wealth and business success — whether that business is crafting hick-hop music, catching alligators or designing duck calls. Ostensibly produced for middle America, they offer a population disenfranchised by globalization and the information economy a vision of rural ingenuity rewarded. Mr. Trump based his candidacy around this population. He spoke directly to voters raised on reality TV, addressing their fears and aspirations with blunt talk. He became their perfect celebrity champion, a rich white man, his image polished by years in a reality-TV boardroom, who validated their demographic anxiety. In an election season driven more by hatred of political opponents than enthusiasm for two deeply unpopular candidates, President-Elect Donald J. Trump hated best, and won. I am wondering today if the same embarrassment that prevents some of us from admitting that we watch “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” also kept Trump supporters from admitting to pollsters that they were voting for a man they knew the media considered a bigot. Two months ago, I started working on a new series, “Trumpigration,” a travel show about where to move if Donald Trump somehow got elected. That, too, was designed as a lighthearted comedy. Now, facing the prospect of four years of a Trump presidency, it’s beginning to feel like the last chance to change the channel.  By  Roberto Suro  If you are in shock over the election results, don’t blame Latinos. They favored Hillary Clinton by better than two to one, according to the exit polls. They did not turn out in big numbers to protest Donald J. Trump, but it probably would not have mattered. It turns out that Latinos were the election’s biggest losers and not just because Mr. Trump won the presidency after a long campaign of slinging threats and insults at them. The bitterest loss was dealt by the 59.5 million mostly white people who voted for Mr. Trump. That was a rejection by their own countrymen. According to the exit polls — a rough measure of turnout at best — Latinos accounted for 11 percent of the votes cast Tuesday the same as 2012. If those numbers hold, there was little or no Trump effect, and however much the number of Latino votes increased was just a result of demography. You may have been convinced that it would be otherwise. Years of reckless commentary, news stories and advocacy insisted that Latinos would be the great demographic firewall that would safeguard progressive politics with surging population numbers. But, the firewall only stands in a few states, and the biggest of them, California, New York and Texas, are already decided. Mr. Trump concentrated instead on the old industrial states where Latinos are a sparse presence. When he demonized Mexico and unauthorized immigrants, he gained more in the Electoral College by mobilizing white voters than he lost by alienating Latinos. The national exit polls show that Mrs. Clinton drew 65 percent of the Latino vote compared with 29 percent for Mr. Trump. That is a landslide by any measure, and it is about the same margin in the exit polls for 2008 (67 percent vs. 31 percent). The disappointment sets in when you compare the outcome to 2012. President Barack Obama took 71 percent of the Latino vote in the exit polls that year compared with 27 percent for Mitt Romney. Mr. Trump was supposed to be the bucket of cold water that aroused the sleeping giant, producing not only a stronger preference for the Democratic candidate but also, more important, a spike in turnout. In 2012, with immigration reform on the line, more than 12 million Latino voters stayed home, producing a turnout rate of 48 percent compared with 64 percent for whites and 67 percent for blacks. The much ballyhooed and chronicled “Trump Effect” was supposed to have produced a surge in naturalizations and voter registration over the past year, and news organizations were churning out stories about the “surge” in Latino voting even after the polls closed Tuesday. While more time and data is needed to get a full picture of Latino turnout this year, at first glance it appears Latino numbers were up, and perhaps significantly in some places, but that in fact the giant was barely stirred. Four million more Latinos were eligible to vote Tuesday than in 2012. So, no matter who was running and no matter how low the turnout, the number of Latino votes counted Tuesday was virtually certain to be higher than 2012. In fact, demographic growth alone would have guaranteed Mrs. Clinton an additional 1.3 million votes (about 1 percent of the total votes cast), even if turnout remained at the same dismal rate as 2012, and she got two-thirds of the Latino votes. In Colorado and Nevada, Latino voters surely helped keep the states blue, and under different scenarios those states could have served as the much-advertised Latino firewall. The one real bright spot for Latino Democrats Tuesday came with the election of Catherine Cortez Masto to the Senate in Nevada. That vote may illustrate what it takes to wake up the Latino electorate: a charismatic and qualified candidate, strong mediating institutions, in this case the hospitality workers’ unions in Las Vegas, and well-organized political operation like the one created by Senator Harry Reid, the retiring Democratic leader. Meanwhile, something may have happened in Texas that needs a closer look. Mr. Trump won handily, but only by a 9 percent margin. President Obama lost the state by nearly 16 points in 2012 and by almost 12 points in 2008. A lot of non-Latino newcomers have begun to change the political complexion of the state in recent years, and that formula — newcomers plus Latinos — is what flipped Colorado and Nevada in the past. Florida is the one place where Latinos might have been able to change the results of this election and didn’t. In the exit polls, Latinos accounted for 18 percent of the total vote compared with 17 in 2012, and the split was slightly more favorable to Mrs. Clinton than it was for President Obama four years ago. Mrs. Clinton’s vote tally was more than 200,000 higher than President Obama’s, but Mr. Trump’s was more than 400,000 higher than Mr. Romney’s. And therein lies the result that Latinos will have to live with for the next four years. In a state that has vividly benefited from immigration and trade, a state where Latinos have for the most part prospered and contributed to the prosperity of their neighbors, white voters mobilized to elect a candidate who would angrily erase everything Latinos represent. No one else suffered that kind of defeat on Tuesday.  By  Kevin M. Kruse  With so many predictions about this presidential campaign having turned out to be so very wrong, comparisons to the 1948 presidential race come naturally. In that election, virtually everyone predicted that the Republican Thomas Dewey would beat the “accidental president,” the Democrat, Harry Truman. Pollsters reinforced these assumptions. Elmer Roper announced that he was so sure Dewey would win that he wouldn’t even bother reporting poll results anymore. “My silence on this point can be construed as an indication that Mr. Dewey is still so clearly ahead that we might as well just listen to his inaugural address,” he said. George Gallup kept polling until mid-October, but then rested on those results, assuming the race was over. Pundits agreed. Newsweek surveyed 50 of the nation’s top political reporters in October; every single one said Dewey would win. Republicans and Democrats alike assumed the race was over. On election night, the conservative Chicago Tribune was so confident it called the race early, rushing out a banner headline that would soon be as famous as it was wrong: “Dewey Defeats Truman.” To the amazement of nearly everyone, Truman won by considerable margins. In the popular vote, he took 49.6 percent to Dewey’s 45.1 percent. In the Electoral College, he won 303 votes to Dewey’s 189. While the margins of this year’s election are narrower, the shock and confusion of pollsters and analysts seems just as pronounced. But comparisons between the Truman and Trump campaigns are not neatly drawn. Truman was an outspoken liberal, and he campaigned on preserving and expanding the accomplishments of the New Deal welfare state. He called for expansion of Social Security, more progressive forms of taxation, a higher minimum wage, and a new national system of health insurance. Truman also committed the Democratic Party, long dominated by Southern segregationists, to a new racial liberalism. Notably, he called on Congress to protect the voting rights of African-Americans. In foreign policy, Truman set America against the growing influence of the Soviet Union. In 1947, he announced the Truman Doctrine, which prompted economic aid to Europe through the Marshall Plan and military alliances through a new North Atlantic Treaty Organization. A year later, Truman challenged Soviet expansionism with the Berlin Airlift. Mr. Trump has rejected much of the substance of Truman’s campaign, but in many ways he reflected its style. Truman’s famous “whistle-stop campaign” took him to rural communities and small towns where working-class and middle-class whites felt neglected. In fiery speeches with blunt language, he singled out sources of blame. Truman went after the “do nothing” Republican Congress as a prominent foe, but also denounced an array of “special interests,” including “bloodsuckers who have offices on Wall Street.” Truman named these enemies and promised to “give ’em’ hell.” His crowds believed him and rallied to their candidate. On Election Day, he predicted there were would be “a lot of surprised pollsters.” There were. Though he had reason to gloat, Truman was gracious in victory. The day after the election, the Washington Post staff invited him to a “crow banquet.” All the newspaper pundits, radio commentators and pollsters who predicted his defeat would wear sackcloth and force down a main course of crow; the president, in white tie and tails, would be served roast turkey. Truman declined, saying he had “no desire to crow over anybody or to see anybody eat crow, figuratively or otherwise.” He added, “We should all get together now and make a country in which everybody can eat turkey whenever he pleases.” Mr. Trump is not a politician who operates by anyone else’s playbook, but perhaps in this small but important matter, he can take a lesson from history.  By  Maureen Sullivan  I have to admit it: I am loving it. As the results poured in for Donald J. Trump, I reveled in the Facebook friends who openly mourned the end of humanity. I felt gleeful in trolling the Twitter hashtag #HesNotMyPresident: “I’m laying in bed with tears streaming down my face, just thinking about the future of this country.” This was one of the biggest election upsets in history, so of course everyone is stunned. Me too. Switching among three cable news networks and several websites I wondered: Is he really going to take Florida so easily? Did they just call North Carolina for Trump? Can he possibly win Wisconsin? Pennsylvania? Yup. I rooted for Mitt Romney in 2012 and John McCain in 2008. I ran for the school board in Hoboken, N.J., and lost once before winning the following year. I know what it’s like to have your hopes puddle up on the floor like that dollop of election-night Haagen-Dazs that you dropped and you just don’t care to wipe up. What does it matter? All is lost. You want to announce on Twitter that you are in bed letting the tears stream down your face. I saw this result coming over the summer. In July, five police officers were ambushed in Dallas and three more were killed in Baton Rouge. In August, Colin Kaepernick, the San Francisco 49ers quarterback, sat out the national anthem. In September, an Islamic terrorist, masquerading as a fried chicken salesman in my hometown, Elizabeth, N.J., set off bombs in New York and New Jersey. Mrs. Clinton proclaimed: “I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police.” She put half of Trump’s supporters in that “basket of deplorables.” People I know were angry. They were tired of being told they were racist and bigoted as they went about the business of mowing their lawns, writing college tuition checks and working their jobs as cops, secretaries and teachers’ aides. They kept being told they needed to look inward, examine their sins and judge themselves guilty. They had not forgotten when Barack Obama was running for president in 2008 and his wife, Michelle, said, “For the first time in my adult lifetime, I’m really proud of my country…” So now we have President-Elect Donald Trump. I supported him because he promised to curb regulations, cut taxes and appoint constitutionalists to the Supreme Court. I supported him because Mrs. Clinton doesn’t have what it takes to turn around a stagnant economy or stand up to the special interests that block innovation. In his victory speech, Mr. Trump lifted a line from Abraham Lincoln and spoke of “binding wounds.” I wanted him to be gracious and kind in that moment, and he was. My 89-year-old mother is still appalled by my vote and tells me, with a laugh, that she’s moving to Ireland. And one of my disappointed female friends on Facebook — who, like me is white and college-educated — wrote, “Obama helped expose the deeply racist nature of our country. Trump exposes the anti-intellectual, sexist xenophobia.” But most of my friends, some of whom I suspect cast votes like mine, have stayed quiet. I guess it’s still not politically correct to admit that you are on the Trump train.  By  Viet Thanh Nguyen  Worst-case scenario in the next four years: fascism, a wall, mass deportations, the end of Obamacare, a Trump brand on the White House and either a trade war or an actual war with China (since war is the easiest diversion from domestic unhappiness). Best-case scenario: Ruth Bader Ginsburg refuses to retire or die, the Democratic Party finds a backbone, turns away from its fixation on the center and heeds the call for an economic revolt against the 1 percent, joined by Black Lives Matter, the Occupy movement, and resurgent feminism. Both scenarios could happen at the same time. The second scenario requires Democrats to put their status quo political model to rest. They already had a significant portion of the nonwhite minority vote locked up, but have lost too many working-class white people. Bernie Sanders might not have won over the wealthier whites who were voting with Trump against the seemingly rising tide of minorities, but he might have snared the white working class and some of the white middle class. Here’s the bright side, for those, like me, who are on the liberal-to-left spectrum. If Hillary Clinton had won, she would have run again in 2020, which could have meant four more years of Wall Street liberalism and fire-and-forget perpetual warfare, conducted by drones and Special Operations over the horizon. Now perhaps Elizabeth Warren will be the 2020 Democratic candidate — a white woman, a feminist, and someone more progressive than Clinton. But all this speaks largely about domestic electoral politics. The sickness of the American body politic remains untreated, and will remain untreated, or exacerbated, in a country run by clowns, conspirators, and collaborators. That sickness is imperialism. America is an imperial country, and its decay might now be showing. The power that has brought so much benefit to the country — for white people — is now faltering in its ability to provide those benefits to all white people. The empire’s best hope is to be more inclusive, demographically and economically, but that runs counter to the imperial impulse to hoard power and profit. Warren or someone like her might be better at extracting more social and economic justice for all Americans. But unless such a person finds a way to ease control from the financial-industrial complex, the prospects of halting our decline are weak. Empires rot from the inside even as emperors blame the barbarians.  By  Robert N. Stavins  Donald J. Trump once tweeted that “the concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing noncompetitive.” Twitter messages may not be clear signs of likely public policies, but Mr. Trump followed up during the campaign with his “America First Energy Plan,” which would rescind all of President Obama’s actions on climate change. The plan includes canceling United States participation in the Paris climate agreement and stopping all American funding of United Nations climate change programs. It also includes abandoning the Clean Power Plan, a mainstay of the Obama administration’s approach to achieving its emissions reduction target for carbon dioxide under the Paris agreement. What should we make of such campaign promises? Taking Mr. Trump at his word, he will surely seek to pull the country out of the Paris pact. But because the agreement has already come into force, under the rules, any party must wait three years before requesting to withdraw, followed by a one-year notice period. Those rules would seem to be mere technicalities. The incoming Trump administration simply can disregard America’s pledge to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 26 to 28 percent below the 2005 level by 2025. That is bad enough. But the big worry is what other key countries, including the world’s largest emitter, China, as well as India and Brazil, will do if the United States reneges on its pledge. The result could be that the Paris agreement unravels, taking it from the 97 percent of global emissions currently covered by the pact to little more than the European Union’s 10 percent share. In addition, Mr. Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency probably will stop work on regulations of methane emissions (a very potent greenhouse gas) from existing oil and gas operations. Undoing complex existing regulations, such as the Clean Power Plan, will be more difficult, but a reconstituted Supreme Court will probably help President Trump when that plan inevitably comes before the court. Also, the new president will most likely ask that the Keystone XL pipeline permit application be renewed — and facilitate other oil and gas pipelines around the country. On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump promised to “bring back” the coal industry by cutting environmental regulations. That may not be so easy. The decline of that industry and related employment has been caused by technological changes in mining, and competition from low-priced natural gas for electricity generation, not by environmental regulations. At the same time, Mr. Trump has pledged to promote fracking for oil and gas, but that would make natural gas even more economically attractive, and accelerate the elimination of coal-sector jobs. If he lives up to his campaign rhetoric, Mr. Trump may indeed be able to reverse course on climate change policy, increasing the threat to our planet, and in the process destroy much of the Obama legacy in this important realm. This will make the states even more important players on this critical issue.  By  Dani Rodrik  The real costs of a Donald J. Trump presidency will most likely come on the political rather than on the economic side. We are likely to see some rise in trade barriers and unilateral economic policies. But for all his bluster, I do not expect Mr. Trump to engage in indiscriminate protectionism. We live in a world of supply chains where imposing tariffs on Mexican or Chinese imports will raise costs of United States businesses and make it hard for them to compete. Mr. Trump is a businessman, and he will understand soon, if he does not now, the senselessness of blanket protectionism. We may have plenty of trade disputes with foreign countries. It’s useful to bear in mind here the example of the 1980s, when trade frictions with Japan and other leading exporters produced a slew of so-called new protectionist barriers such as voluntary export restraints. But these did very limited damage to the world economy. Before long, the world embarked on a further and more intense round of globalization. Furthermore, we have robust international institutions, like the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization, that did not exist in the interwar period. And the political lobbies in favor of an open economy (big business and banks) are stronger and retain considerable influence in Washington. So even though the 1930s parallel is on everyone’s mind, I do not think we are in for a collapse of the international economic order and a retreat into trade war. The real danger Mr. Trump poses is the undermining of our politics — the norms that sustain our liberal democracies. His campaign was based on a divisive politics of identity. Ideals of equity, equal rights, diversity and inclusion were submerged under the weight of a rhetoric that raised racial and ethnic tensions and inflamed passions against imagined enemies — Mexican immigrants, Chinese exporters, Muslim refugees. Illiberal democracy has been the bane of several nations around the world. Under Mr. Trump, the traditions in the United States of checks and balances and of rule of law will be tested seriously. The political danger will be greatly magnified by Mr. Trump’s likely economic failure. He comes into office as the putative leader of middle and lower classes who feel they have been left behind. He has raised their expectations in ways that he cannot meet. There is little chance that incomes at the middle and lower end of income distribution will receive a large boost under his policies. The manufacturing jobs that have left will not return no matter how tough Mr. Trump’s trade policies get. These jobs have disappeared for good, largely thanks to technological changes, and not trade. When the full scale of his economic disappointment sinks in sometime during his term, Mr. Trump may well react in the time-honored fashion of global populists like President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. To keep his base mobilized and insulate himself from economic troubles, he may take shelter in an intensified form of the identity politics that worked so well for him during the presidential campaign. This would rip American society further apart along racial and ethnic cleavages. The ugliness that characterized politics during the presidential campaign may be nothing compared with what may be yet to come.  By  Teresa Tritch  Financial markets regained their footing on Wednesday, as investors and traders apparently concluded that a Donald Trump presidency might not be so bad after all. Instead of focusing on how unprepared Mr. Trump is to be president, several traders quoted in the media talked about how deregulation from ending Obamacare and the Dodd-Frank financial reforms — two Republican goals — could lift stock prices for health care companies and banks. They took special solace in Mr. Trump’s promise to boost government spending on infrastructure and in the measured tones of his acceptance speech. Unfortunately, there is no escaping the overarching conclusion that Mr. Trump’s campaign promises, if carried out, would harm the economy. His proposed rollback of Dodd-Frank reforms would invite renewed recklessness. His opposition to Obamacare would renew and intensify households’ financial insecurity. His proposed tax cuts for the rich would exacerbate income inequality, while either blowing a hole in the deficit or requiring deep budget cuts. His stance on trade would impair international commerce and cooperation. His proposed deportation of immigrants would unleash a legal and humanitarian crisis. Even his popular call for more infrastructure spending is flawed. In and of itself, Mr. Trump’s pledge to borrow vast sums to spend on infrastructure would be a sensible move at this time of low interest rates. But vastly increased federal indebtedness in addition to his other harmful economic policies would be piling risk on top of risk. Risk-taking that crosses the line into recklessness can be immensely profitable in the short run, which is what many traders care most about. But it is no way to run an economy on which everyone else depends for long-term prosperity.  By  Emily Bazelon  Now it looks like a warning shot. When Justice Antonin Scalia died in February, Donald Trump was among the first to call for stonewalling President Obama’s choice to fill the seat. “It’s called delay, delay, delay,” he said at the opening of the Republican presidential debate on Feb. 13. Senator Harry Reid, the minority leader, countered that it would be “unprecedented in recent history” for the Supreme Court to go a year without a full complement of justices. But other Republicans, chief among them the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, agreed with Mr. Trump and Senator Ted Cruz: Justice Scalia’s seat should remain vacant until after the election. Undeterred (what else was he supposed to be?), President Obama nominated Merrick Garland, a seasoned judge praised in the past by Republicans like Senator Orrin Hatch. A debate ensued over historical facts, which seems quaintly polite in retrospect. Since 1900, had the Senate ever refused to confirm a nominee in a presidential election year as a result of the impending election? The answer was no (even if Mr. Cruz tried to argue, against the facts, that Justice Anthony Kennedy wasn’t confirmed in the election year of 1988.) The Republicans’ refusal to grant Judge Garland a hearing or schedule a vote was in fact unprecedented. It was a new kind of hardball. And it succeeded. For a blip in August, Republicans took a hit in the polls for  obstructing the Garland nomination. But the moment passed, blown away in the chaos and battle of the presidential election. Judge Garland slipped from view. The parties adapted to a new reality in which both expected either his postelection, pre-inauguration confirmation, or a new nominee chosen by the next president. When they assumed Hillary Clinton would win, Republicans including Senators John McCain of Arizona  and Richard Burr of North Carolina talked about blocking Democratic Supreme Court picks indefinitely. Both were re-elected Tuesday and will return to a Senate still controlled by the Republicans. It’s hard to see how any Republican paid a price for radically altering the norms for Supreme Court appointments. Mr. Trump helped point the way, and the voters rewarded him and those who followed. Choosing a justice in Antonin Scalia’s mold, as he has promised, will allow Mr. Trump to prove himself to the social conservatives for whom the court, and Roe v. Wade, are the defining issues. Under the current rules, Democrats could filibuster his choice, but if that happens, how long will those rules last? 
Mr. Trump’s election has already run over far stronger traditions and norms. Next comes the question of how many additional Supreme Court appointments will come his way. Ruth Bader Ginsburg is 83. Anthony Kennedy is 80. Stephen Breyer is 78. In Supreme Court terms, four years is a long time.  By  Peter Wehner  To say that Donald Trump’s victory was a shock may qualify as the understatement of the century. The polls were wrong. The experts were wrong. I was wrong. Almost everyone was wrong — including those in the Trump campaign who expected to lose. His victory wasn’t just a surprise; it was an event of gigantic dimensions, its radiating effects incalculable. Mr. Trump’s win ranks among the most unlikely and stunning elections in American history. Regardless of how the Trump presidency turns out, this race will be studied a century from now. For those of us who have been vehement critics of Mr. Trump, this is a rather challenging moment. Starting on Jan. 20, he will be the only president we have. He now has a democratic legitimacy we may regret but cannot deny, and there is such a thing as democratic grace. To those who are tempted only to rage and attack and lament what has occurred, a word of counsel to them, and to myself: We need to give Mr. Trump the chance to rise to the moment, as unlikely as we think that may be. At the same time, we can’t possibly erase the history of the last 17 months — the words he said, the things he did, the conspiracy theories he wove, the ignorance, volatility and cruelty he showed — and our concerns aren’t going to evaporate now that he’s about to be in charge of the nuclear triad that during the campaign he didn’t even know existed. I believed, and still believe, that he is a man with a disordered personality and authoritarian tendencies. My job is to give him a chance to prove me wrong; his job is to prove me wrong. Among my worries is that Mr. Trump’s victory will validate his style of politics, his serrated rhetoric. The way he mistreats people will be normalized. This election has brought us to dark places. Rather than this approach being repudiated it will, for many, become a model. “All the decent drapery of life is to be rudely torn off,” in the words of Edmund Burke. If the Trump campaign foreshadows his presidency, America under Trump will be fundamentally different than it has been — coarser, less temperate and civilized, more inward and resentful. The Republican Party will fundamentally change, from a conservative party to one that champions European-style ethnic nationalism. (The Democratic Party, whose members were certain Hillary Clinton would win, will be convulsed as it enters a period of intense recrimination.) A few hours after Mr. Trump was declared the winner, I received a note from a friend of mine, the distinguished Christian writer Philip Yancey, who told me, “I’m surprised and befuddled, but not scared, thanks to the checks-and-balances strength of American democracy. I tremble, though, to think what an unpredictable leader offers to a world in growing crisis.” He added, “Some say God moves in mysterious ways.  I say, God grants humans the freedom to move in even more mysterious ways.” What happened on Nov. 8th was a mystery that may lead to calamity. I hope to God it won’t.  By  Anna North  I spent the days leading up to the election in Pennsylvania talking to some young voters , 18, 19, 20 years old. They wore flowered Doc Martens, fake fur coats, earbuds dangling from one ear. Overwhelmingly, they were open and polite. They were smart. They were angry at a political system they felt ignored them, but they hoped for better days ahead. In January, Donald Trump will be their next president. Many of these young people supported Mr. Trump. Many did so reluctantly. One young Trump supporter told me that no one knows exactly what Mr. Trump will do in office. Another described hesitating while filling out his absentee ballot, wondering if he could vote for a man who had made abhorrent comments about women. But some voted for Mr. Trump enthusiastically. Those who supported Hillary Clinton were disgusted by Mr. Trump and what he stands for. Today, they’re dealing with a new reality they didn’t expect. I’m thinking of Bria Blackshear, a 20-year-old Temple University student who had waited more than an hour at her polling place in north Philadelphia. “Donald Trump doesn’t represent the ideals I would want for this country,” she said. I’m thinking of Brooke Renner, 18, also a Temple student, who was waiting in line for a second time. She’d given up earlier, but was back and willing to wait as long as it took to cast her vote for Mrs. Clinton. Otherwise, she said, “I’d feel personally responsible if Donald Trump wins.” I’m thinking of Sierra Taylor, a 19-year-old student at the Community College of Philadelphia, who said, “black people feel like our votes don’t matter.” I’m thinking of her friend Naiya Johnson, 22, who, when asked about her hopes for the next four years, said, “I hope we make it.” I’m also thinking of the young people I saw debating the issues that matter to them. Of the table full of young men at Bucks County Community College arguing about Mr. Trump when one, the quietest, spoke up to say, “Trump has no respect for women.” Of the young man, who, as his friend criticized Mrs. Clinton’s record as secretary of state, interjected that Mr. Trump is racist, sexist and xenophobic. They’d had the argument once before, they said. I hope they keep talking. I think they will. It’s a frightening time to grow up. But these young voters are clear-eyed about the shortcomings of government and optimistic enough to imagine a better world. They can make friends with people of different viewpoints, and, when it matters, they can challenge their friends to think in a new way.  By  Seamus McGraw  BRODHEADSVILLE, Pa. — Thinking back now, I can’t for the life of me figure out how I got it so wrong. He seemed so troubled by what he was about to do, as if he knew it was a mistake, but one he felt compelled to make. The way I read the pained look on his face, I thought he was almost apologizing; maybe seeking a kind of absolution. It was just a few days before the election, and I had been canvassing for the Democrats. I wasn’t out there because I was a particularly ardent Clinton supporter. She had certainly not been my first choice, my second or even my third. I’m one of those middle-aged white men without a college degree who had been holding out for Joe Biden to change his mind. But I felt as if I had an obligation to make certain that, at least in my little corner of Pennsylvania, a man who was, to my mind, so obviously unsuited to the highest office in the world, was not just defeated, but repudiated. I expected that my neighbors and friends and the strangers down the road would do just that. Sure, I could feel and even share their frustration over the fact that the longest postwar economic recovery had left so many of my neighbors behind. I had been left behind, too. And yes, I understood the fear of an uncertain world, and the stress of profound cultural changes that were upending so many things that my neighbors took as bedrock values. But I thought the character traits that had always defined the people I knew in eastern Pennsylvania — true conservatives with a sense of responsibility and decency — would in the end lead them to reject “Trumpism,” whatever that actually is. My job wasn’t to help Clinton win. I thought — or at least the pundits were telling me — that was a done deal. The way I saw it, my only task was to drive up her margins and to do that, I was working off a carefully curated list of likely Clinton voters thoughtfully provided to me by the local campaign office. And so when I knocked on this gentleman’s door on a back road in the rural, conservative West End of Monroe County, and he told me that he was indeed planning on voting for Donald Trump, I was ready to simply turn away. But he wouldn’t let me go. “I just can’t trust her,” he said. He made eye contact and kept it. Relentlessly. He and I were of the same rough demographic. Just like me, he was well into his 50s, with teeth that had seen better days. Just like me, he was lower middle class, judging from his surroundings. And as he rattled off a list of shopworn talking points — Benghazi, emails, pay for play — I felt as if I was hearing a stranger’s confession. I felt as if he wanted me to understand and forgive him for what he was about to do. I remember thinking to myself that when this was over, I was going to have to find a way to build a bridge back to this guy who was, in so many ways, just like me. Such was my arrogance. Late last night, as I watched Pennsylvania turn red for the first time in a generation, I kept thinking back to that man, and how I so misread his expression and his words. It wasn’t sorrow etched in his face. It was pity. For me. Because he knew, long before I did, how wrong I was.  —  Seamus McGraw is the author of “Betting the Farm on a Drought.”   By  Beverly Gage  In his victory speech last night, Donald J. Trump paid homage to “the forgotten men and women of our country,” vowing that they “will be forgotten no longer.” This essential political idea — that a vast segment of the nation’s white citizens have been overlooked, or looked down upon — has driven every major realignment in American politics since the New Deal. In 1932, at the darkest moment of the Great Depression, Franklin Roosevelt evoked the “forgotten man” as a reason to rebuild the economy from the “bottom up.” More than three decades later, after Richard Nixon’s 1968 victory, the journalist Peter Schrag identified the “Forgotten American” — the white “lower middle class” voter — as the key to the nation’s apparent rejection of the Great Society and the New Deal order. “In the guise of the working class — or the American yeoman or John Smith — he was once the hero of the civic books, the man that Andrew Jackson called ‘the bone and sinew of the country,’ ” Mr. Schrag wrote. “Now he is ‘the forgotten man,’ perhaps the most alienated person in America.” That this “forgotten” American could be used both to uphold and to dismantle liberalism suggests that this American political identity has never been especially fixed: Democrat or Republican, liberal or conservative, but populist above all. Since the 1960s, the phrase has also implied that the country was paying too much attention to the wrong sorts of people — most notably, to African-Americans — at the expense of the white working class.
It is no coincidence that the “forgotten men and women of our country” began their migration into the Republican Party at the very moment that African-Americans were asserting their right to vote, and voting Democratic, in large numbers for the first time. Mr. Trump’s victory will go down as one of the great upsets in United States history, but it is also the product of a long and bitter struggle over race and class in this country. The Yale sociologist William Graham Sumner is often credited with coining the term “forgotten man.” Writing near the dawn of the Progressive Era, he lamented the lost autonomy of hard-working citizens suddenly forced to pay for high-flown programs of social reform. Sumner’s most famous political essay, “What the Social Classes Owe to Each Other,” rejected the very idea that government might mitigate class antagonisms by sharing the social wealth. What did social classes owe to each other? Not much, in Sumner’s view. And his “forgotten man” owed the least of all. In his 1932 campaign for the presidency, Roosevelt sought to claim the term for a different and more expansive purpose. “These unhappy times call for the building of plans that rest upon the forgotten,” he said in a radio address from Albany in April 1932, for plans “that build from the bottom up and not from the top down, that put their faith once more in the forgotten man at the bottom of the economic pyramid.” To Roosevelt, the “forgotten man” encompassed the industrial worker and struggling farmer and Keynesian consumer — ordinary citizens without whom a modern economy would falter. He built the New Deal around this image, establishing the minimum wage, Social Security and the federal right to organize unions. Those reforms cemented the loyalty of the white working class to the Democratic Party for a generation. But the New Deal also “forgot” — or excluded — many people, including African-Americans. When the Great Society came along, Lyndon Johnson tried to make up for that by expanding federal programs serving the poor and by championing the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts. As the country started to “remember” its long-delayed promises of equality, however, the “forgotten American” began to emerge as term of exclusion and resistance to change. “There is hardly a language to describe him, or even a set of social statistics,” Mr. Schrag wrote in his August 1969 essay, “ The Forgotten American .” “Just names: racist-bigot-redneck-ethnic-Irish-Italian-Pole-Hunkie-Yahoo. The lower middle class. A blank.” As Mr. Schrag noted, all of that name-calling was part of the problem, a refusal on the part of liberal elites to recognize the real grievances and desires of what had once been a bedrock Democratic constituency. In the 1968 campaign, Nixon capitalized on this resentment with calls for “law and order,” a phrase that evoked not only fears of crime, but also anger at protesters and rioters and the college-campus liberals who tolerated them. Mr. Trump put that phrase back into political circulation in 2016, a gesture of solidarity with the old ways of thinking about the “silent majority” — and the “forgotten American.” And though he included “men and women” in his victory speech, Mr. Trump’s campaign mobilized around the same image that once animated the Roosevelt coalition: the “forgotten” white working-class man. Race, too, remains an indelible part of today’s conversation about who has been “forgotten” and who deserves to be seen. To dismiss this language as simple racism, however, is to miss at least some of its political significance. What happened in the late 1960s and 1970s was not only that the Republican Party reclaimed and redefined Roosevelt’s “forgotten man” for a more conservative age. During those years, the Democratic Party itself began to turn away from the New Deal and its working-class politics, especially from its commitment to organized labor. With Mr. Trump’s election, we may be witnessing the rise of a new party system, with the Democrats now the standard-bearers of racial tolerance and free-market globalization, and the Republicans the party of nationalist populist revolt. But as Roosevelt showed, this need not be a fixed political equation. If the 2016 election marks the final, gasping end of the New Deal coalition, it should also mark the start of a new reckoning within the Democratic Party.  By  Helen Lewis  LONDON — You can’t throw a peanut in a Westminster pub without hitting an obsessive follower of American politics. Start a conversation about “The West Wing” with any member of Parliament and expect to get a long disquisition on that American political drama’s best episodes. During Britain’s last general election, in 2015, both main political parties here proudly boasted about being advised by veterans of Barack Obama’s campaign. Until now, our Americophilia has been unrequited. Then in August, Donald J. Trump declared himself “Mr. Brexit.” For Mr. Trump and his supporters, Britain’s vote in June to leave the European Union was evidence of a growing popular revolt against multiculturalism, porous borders and political elites. If the British electorate could deliver a result that baffled its financial sector, its scientists and metropolitan liberals – and was not widely predicted by pollsters – couldn’t the same sort of upset happen in America? It just did. Mr. Trump’s victory feels like a flashback to June, although where Brexit divided members of Britain’s political class, the American election results have united them. Politicians of the mainstream right and left alike are dumbfounded that the United States  would elect someone who uses the extreme language Mr. Trump does and who seems to have little love for institutions like NATO. Last December, Britain’s former Conservative prime minister, David Cameron, described Mr. Trump’s proposed ban on Muslims entering America as “divisive, stupid and wrong.” The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan of the Labour Party, has called the president-elect’s views on Islam “ignorant.” Apart from Nigel Farage, the face of the far-right U.K. Independence Party, it is difficult to find a British politician with a good word to say about Mr. Trump. Nationalism, white anger and protectionism are now driving politics in Britain and across Europe. The sound is of doors slamming. Brexit felt like a referendum on border control, and on rapid demographic change among white communities that felt themselves deprived of attention and resources. It is tempting to draw comparisons with the United States: The big cities in both Britain and the United States, which are most diverse, are also most relaxed about that diversity. In smaller communities, immigration feels more disruptive. There are other parallels. Mr. Trump’s victory was driven by older, white voters, who were struggling but not destitute. He won white men without college degrees by a landslide. A typical Leave supporter has a similar demographic profile. Such voters are on the decline, as both Britain and the United States become more diverse and younger generations are better-educated, and more open to immigration and change. But as both the Brexit vote and Mr. Trump’s victory showed, they are far from a spent force.  By  Susan Chira  Women, as Hillary Clinton showed this morning , know how to absorb pain. And Mrs. Clinton has had plenty of practice about how to stand before the cameras after public humiliation. Clearly, she needed time to compose herself. She made no appearances overnight, instead calling Donald J. Trump to concede. But when she strode onstage in purple and gray, Bill Clinton behind her in a purple tie, her voice did not waver. Women seldom have the luxury of giving in to pain. Many have children or grandchildren or aging parents to tend, whether they themselves are sick or in emotional turmoil. So Mrs. Clinton faced her despondent campaign staff and her despondent half of the country and tried to rally them. She spoke most directly to young people, and to women and girls. She had hoped to stand before them as a symbol of all that women could achieve. Now she had to demonstrate once again what women can endure. “I’ve had successes and setbacks, sometimes really painful ones,” she told them. It was hard not to recall her standing beside Bill Clinton after the whole world knew graphic and humiliating details about the affairs he had denied having. “To all the women and especially the young women who put their faith in me I want you to know that nothing has made me prouder than to be your champion,” she said, and here she had to clear her throat. “I know we still have not shattered that highest and hardest glass ceiling but some day somebody will, and hopefully sooner than we might think right now.” It’s difficult to know right now all that stood in the way of shattering that ceiling. Was it a woman, or this woman? Was it Mrs. Clinton as symbol of the Washington establishment, as a consummate insider in a time of profound distrust of the elite? We do know that voters disproportionately punish women who are seen as dishonest. We do know that it’s hard for strong, assertive and ambitious women to be seen as likable and competent at the same time. Political scientists and cultural commentators will long debate what happened in this election, to this woman and to many women.  The question is whether the image of Mrs. Clinton, composed and gracious in defeat, persevering through pain, will inspire women to try again?  By  Felix Salmon  Markets always move after seismic events, like the unexpected election of Donald J. Trump. Still, market moves need to be interpreted. Even if you believe that markets are right, it’s not always obvious what they’re saying. One way to think about the market’s gyrations is the idea of mean and variation. When Barack Obama (a.k.a. No Drama Obama) was elected president, it was possible to anticipate — correctly, it turned out — that he would help steer America back onto a course of steady growth, low inflation and falling unemployment. Think of that as the Obama mean: the baseline expectation. When the stock market expects good things like that, it tends to rise, just as it has during the Obama presidency. But the variation is just as important as the mean. Mr. Obama didn’t always give the markets what they wanted, but by the same token he was always clear about what he was going to do. He promised them something much more valuable: a low-risk upward economic trajectory. Mr. Trump is the exact opposite of Mr. Obama. His baseline is worse, for starters: to establish expectations for his presidency, you have to factor in his hugely irresponsible fiscal policy, potential trade wars and maybe even reckless brinkmanship over repaying the national debt. Put those things together, and a severe recession becomes possible. But it gets even worse because Mr. Trump is by his nature highly unpredictable. However bad you think he’s going to be, it’s entirely possible that your prediction will turn out to be ridiculously optimistic. Mr. Trump has vastly more downside risk than Mr. Obama ever had, and so markets are going to trade at a discount to his already-discounted baseline. If you transition, then, from low-risk positive expectations to high-risk negative expectations, you have to expect the markets to take some precipitous plunges along the way. Much of that will be noise. The markets always fluctuate randomly in the short term, and there’s no point in trying to read anything meaningful into those moves. That’s why it’s dangerous to read too much into midnight stock-market futures trading, or a sudden plunge in the value of the Mexican peso once it becomes obvious that Mr. Trump will become president. Those moves might be a rational response to the lower expected value of the assets in question. On the other hand, they might just be the result of panicky hedging — or indeed they could simply represent dealers second-guessing and trying to outmaneuver one another. Once the market has been trading steadily for a few months, its general direction under the auspices of the new government is going to be pretty clear. Fluctuations over just a few hours, by contrast, are much harder to read. They might look like signals — but all too often they turn out to be nothing but noise. And as we’ve learned during this long, brutal election, separating noise from signals can be a very tricky business.  By  Michael Lerner  It turns out that shaming the supporters of Donald J. Trump is not a good political strategy. Though job loss and economic stagnation played a role in his victory, so did shame. As the principal investigator on a study of the middle class for the National Institute of Mental Health, I found that working people’s stress is often intensified by shame at their failure to “make it” in what they are taught is a meritocratic American economy. The right has been very successful at persuading working people that they are vulnerable not because they themselves have failed, but because of the selfishness of some other villain (African-Americans, feminists, immigrants, Muslims, Jews, liberals, progressives; the list keeps growing). Instead of challenging this ideology of shame, the left has buttressed it by blaming white people as a whole for slavery, genocide of the Native Americans and a host of other sins, as though whiteness itself was something about which people ought to be ashamed. The rage many white working-class people feel in response is rooted in the sense that once again, as has happened to them throughout their lives, they are being misunderstood. So please understand what is happening here. Many Trump supporters very legitimately feel that it is they who have been facing an unfair reality. The upper 20 percent of income earners, many of them quite liberal and rightly committed to the defense of minorities and immigrants, also believe in the economic meritocracy and their own right to have so much more than those who are less fortunate. So while they may be progressive on issues of discrimination against the obvious victims of racism and sexism, they are blind to their own class privilege and to the hidden injuries of class that are internalized by much of the country as self-blame. The right’s ability to portray liberals as elitists is further strengthened by the phobia toward religion that prevails in the left. Many religious people are drawn by the teachings of their tradition to humane values and caring about the oppressed. Yet they often find that liberal culture is hostile to religion of any sort, believing it is irrational and filled with hate. People on the left rarely open themselves to the possibility that there could be a spiritual crisis in society that plays a role in the lives of many who feel misunderstood and denigrated by the fancy intellectuals and radical activists. The left needs to stop ignoring people’s inner pain and fear. The racism, sexism and xenophobia used by Mr. Trump to advance his candidacy does not reveal an inherent malice in the majority of Americans. If the left could abandon all this shaming, it could rebuild its political base by helping Americans see that much of people’s suffering is rooted in the hidden injuries of class and in the spiritual crisis that the global competitive marketplace generates. Democrats need to become as conscious and articulate about the suffering caused by classism as we are about other forms of suffering. We need to reach out to Trump voters in a spirit of empathy and contrition. Only then can we help working people understand that they do not live in a meritocracy, that their intuition that the system is rigged is correct (but it is not by those whom they had been taught to blame) and that their pain and rage is legitimate."
"","Advertisement  By  The New York Times  How the election and Donald Trump’s victory looks to Opinion writers.  By  Maureen Sullivan  I am a white, college-educated woman. I am much closer in age to Hillary Clinton than I am to Chelsea Clinton. I am a mother, a Catholic Jersey girl, raised in a pro-union household. And I am voting for Donald J. Trump. My 89-year-old mother is appalled, as are many of my friends who are also white, college-educated women. I don’t care. For me it was an easy choice. To my teenage daughter I have to explain how men — Donald J. Trump or the Harvard men’s soccer team — say gross things about women in locker rooms and on celebrity buses. That’s bad enough. But I also have had to explain that Hillary will be bringing Bill Clinton back into the White House. Everyone should be aware that the former president, who was impeached, lied about at least one sexual assault and used another woman, an intern, as a sex toy in the Oval Office. Then there are the issues. Really? my friends ask. Issues like building a wall, keeping out Muslims and picking on Mexicans? Like talking about grabbing unnamed women in inappropriate ways? How could you? He’s a buffoon, a blowhard, a billionaire. He mocked a war hero, critiqued a beauty queen, sniffed an awful lot during those debates. But, yes, issues. This economy is bumping along the bottom with less than 2 percent annual growth for the past eight years. Mrs. Clinton, like many of my friends, has no idea how important economic growth is to the strength and vitality of our country. Mr. Trump vows to build the Keystone pipeline, curb regulations that strangle businesses and cut taxes to unleash the economy. Mrs. Clinton will do the opposite. I’m a former elected member of the Hoboken, N.J., school board, and I write about education issues for Forbes.com. The public teachers unions have given Mrs. Clinton huge donations as a way to protect their near monopoly. In return, she has said virtually nothing about K-12 education. Mr. Trump’s comprehensive plan for reallocating federal funds would be a boon to school-choice initiatives. He wants to put constitutionalists on the Supreme Court; she doesn’t. She will double down on the debacle of Obamacare; he will dismantle it. He wants to rip up trade agreements, and he’s completely wrong on that. But Mrs. Clinton now says she is also opposed to a new trade deal with Asian countries. The Republicans in Congress might be able to bring Mr. Trump around. But Mrs. Clinton will be under intense pressure from the left to remain anti-trade. She is notorious for surrounding herself with people who cover up her lies and poor judgment. Benghazi, the top-secret emails, the private server, the Clinton Foundation. He will come into office less burdened by party loyalties, able to pick independent-minded cabinet members and advisers. Will he be a good president? I’m still not sure. Will she? The odds are against it.  By  Daniel K. Williams  Donald J. Trump was elected with a higher percentage of the white evangelical vote than any other Republican presidential candidate has ever received, and he has received strong support from prominent Christian Right leaders. Yet if Mr. Trump delivers on his promises, he will not give the religious right what its leaders have traditionally demanded or what the Republican Party platform calls for. Indeed, he will give them very little national legislation at all, but will instead offer them maximum latitude to pursue their agenda at the state level — a shift that may portend a potential breakthrough in the nation’s polarizing culture wars. National legislation has long been the goal of the religious right. When the movement emerged in the late 1970s, evangelical leaders such as Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson sought federal constitutional amendments to ban abortion and restore school prayer, because they wanted to reverse what liberal rights activists had done at the national level through the Supreme Court. In the early 21st century, leaders such as James Dobson continued this trend by persuading   President George W. Bush to endorse a constitutional amendment proposal to define marriage as exclusively heterosexual. In recent years, evangelicals have become so concerned about protecting their own religious liberty against federal mandates or court decisions that they have given less attention to imposing a moral agenda on the rest of the nation. Although the Republican Party platform continues to promise a constitutional amendment protecting human life from the moment of conception, the pro-life movement has not made any serious attempts to pass that amendment since the 1980s. Nor has there been much talk in the last decade of a national ban on same-sex marriage. Mr. Trump is well positioned to promote a further shift away from national moral regulation. For much of his adult life, he held culturally libertarian views on abortion and gay rights, and he evinced little interest in the religious right’s agenda. Early in his campaign, he expressed discomfort with conservative evangelicals’ opposition to the rights of transgender people to use the public restroom of their choice. But he quickly came to embrace a “states’ rights” position on same-sex marriage and transgender rights, a position that would allow culturally liberal New Yorkers the right to pursue different policies than cultural conservatives in Mississippi or North Dakota. And while Mr. Trump stumbled over abortion during his campaign, the policy that he ultimately reverted to was to leave abortion legalization up to the states — an outcome that he would try to ensure by nominating conservative Supreme Court justices who might overturn Roe v. Wade. Mr. Trump has gone further than any previous Republican presidential nominee in a generation in insisting that the religious right should enact its agenda at the state, rather than federal, level.  Although this was the policy position of many Republicans during the 1970s (including President Gerald Ford), religious right activists persuaded the G.O.P. in the early 1980s to abandon its states-rights approach to abortion and other social issues, and promise national legislation to implement the religious right’s agenda. Mr. Trump is leading the party back to its more traditional stance. While many liberals will find this outcome unsatisfactory — since it offers them no opportunity to secure national protection for individual rights that they consider inalienable — it may be the only compromise solution that can give both conservatives and liberals the freedom to pursue their own agenda at the local level without fear of a national backlash. If a socially libertarian New Yorker can deliver this compromise to the conservative white rural evangelical voters who put him in office, both conservatives and liberals should see that for what it is: a landmark opportunity to move beyond the culture wars.  By  Marwan Bishara  Just when the people of the Middle East thought things couldn’t get any worse, Donald J. Trump is elected president of the United States. Now, their apprehension about the president-elect dwarfs their disappointment with President Obama. It could be a blessing in disguise. America, in one magic moment, you’ve revealed how you’ve changed. For the worse. Poor you, you feel so insecure, vulnerable and fragile. Like the rest of us. So, instead of reaching for your famed “can-do” spirit, lifting yourselves up by the bootstraps, you turned to a strident, bellicose type of nationalism. The kind usually associated with strutting generalissimos of Third World nations with their chests covered with made-up, self-awarded medals. Maybe the people of the Middle East will look and realize that you are no longer the Great Democracy to emulate. That your modern style of empire and your role as keeper of the world order for the world’s own good are stumbling and failing, even in your own eyes; and that we in the Middle East should not be turning to you for rescue. For as long as I can remember, you’ve been on a self-assigned mission to change the Middle East. Indeed, the world. Now, it seems as if the change has flowed the other way. You’ve voted to reduce your liberties. To narrow the range of people entitled to justice and equality before the law. To live in a place where the police should not be criticized; where fighting political correctness is more important than fighting racism; where Muslims are suspected and people who appear Hispanic can be rounded up if they’re not carrying their papers. In this election you’ve revealed that your people — like Russians, Hungarians, Iraqis, Iranians and others whose politics you normally look down on — will choose a narrow, nonsensical nationalist ethos when they feel threatened by uncertainty. Your imperial outreach allowed you to experience other cultures, but now you’ve chosen to shrink your outlook, with the expectation that the world will continue to revolve around you. It won’t. Like the rest of us, you’re now divided between those who want to make their nation great again alone and those who want to make it great together. O.K., enough about you; let’s talk about us. We in the Middle East can’t decipher what exactly your incoming president wants from us. I don’t think he knows, either. Mr. Trump said he would bring back torture and ban Muslims from entering America, and he compared the threat of “radical Islam” to Soviet Communism. He wants less engagement in the region, and fewer “free riders” like the Saudis who don’t pay enough for American protection. And he wants the United States to abandon the costly nation-building in the Middle East. What nation-building? In Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Yemen, Libya and Somalia, civil wars continue unabated. The Arab and Muslim worlds only hope the United States stops contributing to the destruction.
Mr. Trump does not exactly seem concerned for the wishes of Middle Easterners and their right to live in peace. It sounds more like what he really wants to do is pal around with other strutting, authoritarian types. Expect him to cozy up to Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, and join him in supporting Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad. Expect America’s new president to work closely with Egypt’s president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, and Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. Mr. Trump has embraced Mr. Netanyahu’s positions on Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and on abandoning the two-state solution. Instead of Americanizing the Middle East, Mr. Trump seems set on “Israelizing” America, stirring fear of Muslims and trying to wall out “the other.” Arabs, and Middle Easterners in general, should take one quick look and figure out how to be less dependent on the United States, and how to resolve their conflicts within their own, regional frameworks.
Finally, some good news. President Obama has assured us that the sun will rise tomorrow, regardless. And if the Trump presidency is as bad as I expect it to be — though not so bad that it demolishes democracy entirely — he can be voted out in four years. Meanwhile, fasten your seatbelts. It’s going to be a hell of a ride.  By  Carol Giacomo  A commitment to human rights has been a fundamental precept of NATO since the alliance was created a half century ago. You would not expect that a founding member would have to be reminded of that fact. Certainly not the United States, for all those years the leader of NATO and an inspirational embodiment of its core values. Yet this is where we find ourselves now, the day after Donald Trump won the presidency: In congratulating him on his victory, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany felt compelled to set conditions for cooperation. “Germany and America are connected by values of democracy, freedom and respect for the law and the dignity of man, independent of origin, skin color, religion, gender, sexual orientation or political views,” she said in a statement, adding: “I offer the next President of the United States close cooperation on the basis of these values.” Mr. Trump’s behavior during his campaign was antithetical to those values. He has threatened to ban Muslims from the United States, refuse refugees, deport 11 million undocumented workers and build a wall on the border with Mexico. He has disparaged African Americans, Mexican Americans, women and people with disabilities. Moreover, Mr. Trump has called into question America’s commitment to NATO and displayed a befuddling penchant for defending Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, who is waging war in eastern Ukraine and destabilizing other parts of Europe by supporting far-right groups. He received no pushback on Wednesday from Theresa May, the British prime minister, who simply congratulated Mr. Trump on his win. The two leaders’ reactions were further proof that, after Britain’s decision to leave the European Union, we will have to look to Mrs. Merkel not just to lead Europe but to replace America in leading NATO as well.  By  Gil Troy  “I am scared that if Ronald Reagan gets into office, we are going to see more of the Ku Klux Klan and a resurgence of the Nazi Party,” Coretta Scott King said in November, 1980. “I’m afraid things are going to blow sky high during this next term,” a nursing student said. He’s a “nitwit,” added a Democrat. “He’s shallow, superficial and frightening,” one of that year’s historic numbers of “undecideds” insisted. Ronald Reagan “seems not to relish complexity and subtlety,” the New York Times editorial endorsing President Jimmy Carter’s re-election proclaimed. “The problem is not a loose lip but the simple answer.”  While fearing what Reagan’s own running mate, George H.W. Bush, had dismissed as Reagan’s “voodoo economics” during their primary fight, the editorial board feared “voodoo diplomacy,” too. From coast to coast, half of a divided nation abhorred —  and underestimated — the president-elect. “The American people,“ Hamilton Jordan, a key Carter aide, said, "are not going to elect a 70-year-old, right-wing, ex-movie actor to be president.” Pollsters reported in 1980 that “More voters held negative attitudes toward each presidential candidate than in any campaign since polling began” — a record we just broke in 2016. The economic dislocation of galloping inflation and the energy crisis produced a nasty campaign. Feeling neglected by Washington, millions embraced Ronald Reagan’s populism. Despite the Democratic panic, Ronald Reagan left America richer and safer after two terms as president. Reagan defied expectations by turning toward the center. He acted as president of the United States, not president of the Republican Party. Reagan used the transition period to heal wounds while claiming a broad policy mandate, despite winning only 50.7 percent of the popular vote. He vowed to “rebuild a bipartisan base for American foreign policy.” His cabinet choices were so moderate that Pat Buchanan, the conservative flamethrower whose rhetorical bluster anticipated the advent of Donald Trump, lamented: “Where is the dash, color, and controversy — the customary concomitants of a Reagan campaign?” Just weeks into Reagan’s first term, conservatives were demanding that his aides had to “Let Reagan be Reagan,” meaning: stop being so reasonable. But in adjusting, in tempering, Reagan was being Reagan. He knew the Constitution limited presidential powers — and he faced a Democratic Congress led by the formidable speaker of the House Tip O’Neill to remind him further. Illustrating Richard Neustadt’s lesson that the power of the president is mostly “the power to persuade,” many of Reagan’s achievements were symbolic. Rather than shrinking government as he promised, for example, he only lowered the federal government’s growth rate. History is not destiny. And Reagan had both a lighter touch than Mr. Trump, and eight years’ experience as  governor of California. Still, history is full of shifts and surprises. Mr. Trump must be a healer and unite America, as he tried doing in his victory speech. If he fails, the checks and balances that sometimes help crusading ideologues become effective leaders can ultimately impose a necessary gridlock. When asked about conservatives’ frustration with him, Reagan kindly insisted it was only a “very few” critics. He said: “There are some people who think that you should, on principle, jump off the cliff with the flag flying if you can’t get everything you want.” Reagan recalled that “If I found when I was governor that I could not get 100 percent of what I asked for, I took 80 percent.” So far, Mr. Trump, the political amateur and sputtering demagogue, has lacked Reagan’s magnanimity or his flexibility. Can the reality-show star turned president-elect mimic the actor turned president?  By  James R. Jones  In 1968, there was a demand among voters for change, especially regarding Vietnam and foreign policy, and there was a backlash against some of the Great Society programs. Then, as now, the Democratic candidate was tied to the departing administration and hamstrung to differentiate a new set of policies. As a result, the Democratic presidential nominee, Hubert H. Humphrey, narrowly lost to the Republican, Richard M. Nixon, a candidate who was despised by a large percentage of the electorate. One positive outcome of that election was the first organized transition from the departing to incoming governments. President Lyndon B. Johnson always believed that, after an election, Democrats and Republicans should come together to do what’s right for the country. At the time, I was President Johnson’s appointments secretary, the position that has since evolved into the White House chief of staff. Right after the 1968 results came in, the president put me in charge of organizing a transition process, something that had never been done. “Nixon is an S.O.B., but he’s the only president we’ll have,” Johnson told me. “I want him and all of his team to be fully prepared to govern after the Inauguration at 12 noon on January 20.” A few days later, Johnson and Nixon met at the White House along with Nixon’s top advisers, including H. R. Haldeman and John Mitchell. There we mapped out a program in which all of the Johnson cabinet and major White House staff members would brief their incoming counterparts as often as was desired by the new administration. My charge was to work with Haldeman, who became my successor at the White House, to make sure these briefings occurred across the new administration and in a timely fashion. One surprise was that Nixon told me that Mitchell could speak for him in all matters if he was not available. Johnson would have never delegated such authority, but that was the difference in the management style of the two men. While a smooth transition was important to Johnson, he didn’t stop being president. He was issuing orders and making appointments right up to the morning of the Inauguration. In fact, the day before the Inauguration the president told me to find out how many vacancies existed on commissions and boards and find good people that he could nominate. He kept Nixon waiting in the Blue Room on Inauguration morning while he signed those nominations (which required Senate confirmation) and had them delivered to the Congress before noon. It is a positive sign that President Obama invited Donald J. Trump to meet at the White House two days after this most contentious election. Today transitions are much more institutional now than our first one in 1968. But this process can heal many wounds and start bringing our country closer together. That’s imperative if we want to make our government work for the people again. Back in 1968, Johnson and Nixon left the White House together, along with Senator Everett Dirksen and me. We jumped into the car and headed to the Capitol. Surprisingly, Nixon wanted only to discuss how disappointed he was to have lost Texas (Johnson’s home state) and how determined he was to win it in1972. I hope the ride to the Capitol next January will be more substantive on policy.  By  Sarah Jaffe  If anything has been made clear by the results of this election, it is that the political and pundit class have underestimated the degree of anger and pain in the United States, the degree to which “recovery” has been recovery for a few and stagnation and decline for many more. One exit poll has been haunting me since I saw it: The Reuters/Ipsos early exit poll found that 75 percent of respondents agreed “America needs a strong leader to take the country back from the rich and powerful.” Only slightly fewer agreed that “the American economy is rigged to advantage the rich and powerful,” and — perhaps the kicker — 68 percent believed that “traditional parties and politicians don’t care about people like me.” There’s a lot to unpack in those statements. They may conceal white resentment of the perceived advancement past them of black and Latino people. But they also reveal the sentiment that has been there since the 2008 financial crisis laid bare the lines of power in the country and the world — when, as the protest chant went, “Banks got bailed out, we got sold out.” The downward trends have been with us for decades: the divergence of productivity gains from workers’ incomes, the substitution of credit card debt for raises, the shift of good union jobs and family wages and pensions into low-wage service jobs, and the attendant slashing of the social safety net. But the past eight years sped all that up and made it impossible to ignore. If Donald J. Trump stood out to voters from the rest of the Republican Party, aside from a willingness to say directly the kinds of things usually carefully dogwhistled, it was in his rants about trade and his lack of interest in dismantling the remnants of the welfare state. For white Americans anxiously looking at their disappearing stability, Mr. Trump was a bomb they were willing to throw at a system they felt was failing them. He emotionally echoed their outrage and gave them a place to direct their anger, the age-old right-wing populist trick of refracting it both upward at elites and downward at minorities. Hillary Clinton’s campaign and the mainstream Democratic Party were woefully unprepared to greet this wave. When your response to a cry of “Make America Great Again!” is “America Is Already Great!” you’d better be sure that it feels true to a majority of voters. The results show that it did not. To be sure, Democrats had an uneasy line to walk, between maintaining continuity with a still-popular, twice-elected Barack Obama — a continuity that won Mrs. Clinton the Democratic primary — and reaching the people who wanted and needed change. But the party’s wholehearted backing of Mrs. Clinton was a colossal misreading of a moment when rage at the establishment (of both parties) was simmering everywhere. That rage should have been visible as Mr. Trump ran away with the Republican nomination process despite the opposition of that party’s grandees, and as Bernie Sanders pushed Mrs. Clinton much harder than anyone had expected a gray-haired socialist from Vermont to do. But Mrs. Clinton opened her arms to disaffected Republicans rather than wooing the disaffected within and around her own party. Most of the television ads she ran were more about painting Trump as a dangerous aberration, an outsider unfit for office, than pitching any plan of her own for change. Democrats failed to realize that for many Trump voters, that was exactly what they liked about him.  By  Will Wilkinson  It may not be an exaggeration to say that Donald Trump both knows and cares less about the details of public policy than anyone ever elected president of the United States. This just goes to show that “politics is not about policy,” as Robin Hanson, the futurist and social theorist, likes to say. Mr. Trump’s playbook against Hillary Clinton broke with the hard-won norms of liberal democracy, went back to demagogic, authoritarian political basics, and updated them for  the reality television, social media age. Politics is, at bottom, about factions vying and coordinating to choose leaders in whom to invest authority. Throughout the campaign, Mr. Trump displayed an uncanny and unnerving mastery of the primal politics of authority, and the game of legitimizing his own and delegitimizing his rivals’ claims to authority. In Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump drew a general election opponent pre-weakened by a decades-long Republican campaign of delegitimization. He took advantage of it with shameless audacity, making the most of our culture’s lingering sexism and the popular perception of Mrs. Clinton as a member of an arrogant and corrupt elite that believes it is above the law. But tearing down his opponents was only half of Trump’s equation. The pundits and pollsters so badly botched their predictions in no small part because they failed to grasp the intense, reality-distorting power of Donald Trump’s fame. But Mr. Trump seems to have an intuitive understanding that glamour, celebrity and gaudy wealth are key ingredients in majesty — which is inherently authoritative and underwrites its own claim to legitimacy. Trump’s self-branded personal jet was more than a convenient means of transportation for a very rich man. It was a purple silk, ermine-fringed cape, Air Force One in waiting, and he knew how to use it. The United States, the world’s first nation founded on principled opposition to the pre-Enlightenment politics of majesty and unified authority, has deep-seated norms of republican modesty and propriety. Casting those norms aside and banking heavily on the atavistic political appeal of majestic celebrity gave Mr. Trump an advantage few us were prepared to acknowledge, allowing him to attract the support of an unforeseen numbers of black, Hispanic and female voters, despite his campaign’s naked racism and his scandalously misogynistic and abusive personal history. Because Mr. Trump’s strategy was so indifferent to matters of policy substance, it is incredibly difficult to say what policies Mr. Trump will actually support in office. I don’t think we’ve ever known less about what an incoming president really wants to do with his power. But we do have a clear indication of how he’s likely to wield it. He will cleverly burnish his claim to authority and relentlessly and effectively discredit his opponents, inside and outside the Republican Party, with all the tools of an executive branch that has never been more powerful and less constrained by the constitutional system America’s founders designed specifically as an alternative to and a bulwark against unitary authority.  By  Lindy West  I got up on Election Day and burst into tears — not a genteel twin trickle but a great heaving burst, zero to firehose. Tears spattered the inside of my glasses, dripped from my lips, and left mascara-tinged rosettes blooming black in my cereal milk. “Honey,” my husband crooned to me. “Honey, it’s going to be O.K. The numbers are still good. It’s O.K.” But it wasn’t the numbers. I wasn’t sobbing because I was afraid Hillary Clinton was going to lose. That would come later. I was sobbing Tuesday morning because, as I poured my coffee, I’d caught a glimpse of a cable news interview with Mrs. Clinton just after she voted for herself in Chappaqua, N.Y. She seemed breathless, exhilarated, a little overwhelmed. Over her shoulder, Bill Clinton stared at his wife and beamed. My husband stares at me like that sometimes. It’s not just love — we expect husbands to love their wives — but something less traditional, more conditional and gendered. It’s professional respect. It’s pride. We’re accustomed to that pride flowing the other direction, from wife to husband, because men in our culture get to be more than just bodies, do more than just nurture. Men get to act and excel and climb and aspire and thrive and win and rule and be the audacious, hungry fulcrum of public life. It is normal for men to have ambition. It is normal for women to stand aside. I thought about Bill Clinton meeting Hillary Rodham at Yale in 1971, and how tenacious and intense she must have been even back then, how undeniable and potent. Mr. Clinton describes the moment in his memoir . “She conveyed a sense of strength and self-possession I had rarely seen in anyone, man or woman,“ he wrote. "She was in my face from the start.” He says he once told her , during those years, “I have met all the most gifted people in our generation and you’re the best.” And then I thought about Mr. Clinton rising steadily through his political career, on the track we have built for charismatic, competent white men. He must have known, every second, how good his wife was. Not just good, but “the best.” Better than everyone he’d ever met; better than him, even. And he watched her stand next to him and wait, and wait, and wait, underestimated and degraded and excoriated for wanting more out of life than cookies. And she didn’t quit! She swallowed slander and humiliation and irrational hatred for three decades and she didn’t quit, and here she was, just a hair’s breadth from the presidency of the United States — the first woman ever to be trusted with the rudder of the world. He must be so proud of her, I thought. It made me cry. I cried because I want my daughters to feel that blazing pride, that affirmation of their boundless capacity — not from their husbands, but from their world, from the atmosphere, from inviolable wells of certainty inside themselves. I cried because it’s not fair, and I’m so tired, and every woman I know is so tired. I cried because I don’t even know what it feels like to be taken seriously — not fully, not in that whole, unequivocal, confident way that’s native to handshakes between men. I cried because it does things to you to always come second. Whatever your personal opinion of the Clintons, as politicians or as human beings, that dynamic is real. We, as a culture, do not take women seriously on a profound level. We do not believe women. We do not trust women. We do not like women. I understand that many men cannot see it, and plenty more do not care. I know that many men will read this and laugh, or become defensive, or call me hysterical, or worse, and that’s fine. I am used to it. It doesn’t make me wrong. But maybe this election was the beginning of something new, I thought. Not the death of sexism, but the birth of a world in which women’s inferiority isn’t a given. That grain of hope glowed inside me until around dinner time on Tuesday, the final day of an election so openly misogynist that the question “Sexual assault: good or bad?” was credulously presented for debate. Today doesn’t feel real. It is indistinguishable from fresh, close grief. But if there’s one lesson we can take from Mrs. Clinton, politics aside — and even Donald Trump acknowledged it in the second debate — it’s the limitlessness of human endurance. Those of us who have been left in the cold by this apparent affirmation of a white supremacist patriarchy (and sorry, white women who voted for Mr. Trump, but your shelter is illusory) are tough. We have been weathering this hurricane wall of doubt and violence for so long, and now, more crystalline than ever, we have an enemy and a mandate. We have the smirking apotheosis of our oppression sliming, paw-first, toward our genitals. We have the popular vote. We have proof, in exit polls, that white women will pawn their humanity for the safety of white supremacy. We have abortion pills to stockpile and neighbors to protect and children to teach. We have the right woman to find. We have local elections in a year. The fact that we lost doesn’t make us wrong; the fact that they don’t believe in us doesn’t make us disappear.  By  Seth Grossman  A couple of years ago, I produced a reality-TV show called “Hollywood Hillbillies,” about a family from rural Georgia who, driven by the grandson’s newfound internet fame, moves west to make it in Hollywood. The show centered on the undeniable charisma of “Mema,” the foul-mouthed matriarch who spoke her mind and poked fun at the habits and attitudes of the Los Angeles elite. The show was part of a wave of “redneck reality” shows like “Swamp People,” “Duck Dynasty,” “Bayou Billionaires” and “Moonshiners” that presented a vision of white, rural America as the last authentic place on earth, the last place untarnished by the corruption and cynicism of the elites. “Hollywood Hillbillies” aired on the Reelz Network, a channel owned by a billionaire Republican donor Stanley Hubbard , who funded a pro-Trump “super” PAC after his preferred candidates lost the primaries. Designed as a harmless comedy, the show reveled in Mema’s provocative, off-color remarks, just as Donald J. Trump’s audience revels in his. But now I’m thinking more critically about what shows like this are selling. All of these shows have one thing in common: While trafficking in rural stereotypes, they celebrate wealth and business success — whether that business is crafting hick-hop music, catching alligators or designing duck calls. Ostensibly produced for middle America, they offer a population disenfranchised by globalization and the information economy a vision of rural ingenuity rewarded. Mr. Trump based his candidacy around this population. He spoke directly to voters raised on reality TV, addressing their fears and aspirations with blunt talk. He became their perfect celebrity champion, a rich white man, his image polished by years in a reality-TV boardroom, who validated their demographic anxiety. In an election season driven more by hatred of political opponents than enthusiasm for two deeply unpopular candidates, President-Elect Donald J. Trump hated best, and won. I am wondering today if the same embarrassment that prevents some of us from admitting that we watch “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” also kept Trump supporters from admitting to pollsters that they were voting for a man they knew the media considered a bigot. Two months ago, I started working on a new series, “Trumpigration,” a travel show about where to move if Donald Trump somehow got elected. That, too, was designed as a lighthearted comedy. Now, facing the prospect of four years of a Trump presidency, it’s beginning to feel like the last chance to change the channel.  By  Roberto Suro  If you are in shock over the election results, don’t blame Latinos. They favored Hillary Clinton by better than two to one, according to the exit polls. They did not turn out in big numbers to protest Donald J. Trump, but it probably would not have mattered. It turns out that Latinos were the election’s biggest losers and not just because Mr. Trump won the presidency after a long campaign of slinging threats and insults at them. The bitterest loss was dealt by the 59.5 million mostly white people who voted for Mr. Trump. That was a rejection by their own countrymen. According to the exit polls — a rough measure of turnout at best — Latinos accounted for 11 percent of the votes cast Tuesday the same as 2012. If those numbers hold, there was little or no Trump effect, and however much the number of Latino votes increased was just a result of demography. You may have been convinced that it would be otherwise. Years of reckless commentary, news stories and advocacy insisted that Latinos would be the great demographic firewall that would safeguard progressive politics with surging population numbers. But, the firewall only stands in a few states, and the biggest of them, California, New York and Texas, are already decided. Mr. Trump concentrated instead on the old industrial states where Latinos are a sparse presence. When he demonized Mexico and unauthorized immigrants, he gained more in the Electoral College by mobilizing white voters than he lost by alienating Latinos. The national exit polls show that Mrs. Clinton drew 65 percent of the Latino vote compared with 29 percent for Mr. Trump. That is a landslide by any measure, and it is about the same margin in the exit polls for 2008 (67 percent vs. 31 percent). The disappointment sets in when you compare the outcome to 2012. President Barack Obama took 71 percent of the Latino vote in the exit polls that year compared with 27 percent for Mitt Romney. Mr. Trump was supposed to be the bucket of cold water that aroused the sleeping giant, producing not only a stronger preference for the Democratic candidate but also, more important, a spike in turnout. In 2012, with immigration reform on the line, more than 12 million Latino voters stayed home, producing a turnout rate of 48 percent compared with 64 percent for whites and 67 percent for blacks. The much ballyhooed and chronicled “Trump Effect” was supposed to have produced a surge in naturalizations and voter registration over the past year, and news organizations were churning out stories about the “surge” in Latino voting even after the polls closed Tuesday. While more time and data is needed to get a full picture of Latino turnout this year, at first glance it appears Latino numbers were up, and perhaps significantly in some places, but that in fact the giant was barely stirred. Four million more Latinos were eligible to vote Tuesday than in 2012. So, no matter who was running and no matter how low the turnout, the number of Latino votes counted Tuesday was virtually certain to be higher than 2012. In fact, demographic growth alone would have guaranteed Mrs. Clinton an additional 1.3 million votes (about 1 percent of the total votes cast), even if turnout remained at the same dismal rate as 2012, and she got two-thirds of the Latino votes. In Colorado and Nevada, Latino voters surely helped keep the states blue, and under different scenarios those states could have served as the much-advertised Latino firewall. The one real bright spot for Latino Democrats Tuesday came with the election of Catherine Cortez Masto to the Senate in Nevada. That vote may illustrate what it takes to wake up the Latino electorate: a charismatic and qualified candidate, strong mediating institutions, in this case the hospitality workers’ unions in Las Vegas, and well-organized political operation like the one created by Senator Harry Reid, the retiring Democratic leader. Meanwhile, something may have happened in Texas that needs a closer look. Mr. Trump won handily, but only by a 9 percent margin. President Obama lost the state by nearly 16 points in 2012 and by almost 12 points in 2008. A lot of non-Latino newcomers have begun to change the political complexion of the state in recent years, and that formula — newcomers plus Latinos — is what flipped Colorado and Nevada in the past. Florida is the one place where Latinos might have been able to change the results of this election and didn’t. In the exit polls, Latinos accounted for 18 percent of the total vote compared with 17 in 2012, and the split was slightly more favorable to Mrs. Clinton than it was for President Obama four years ago. Mrs. Clinton’s vote tally was more than 200,000 higher than President Obama’s, but Mr. Trump’s was more than 400,000 higher than Mr. Romney’s. And therein lies the result that Latinos will have to live with for the next four years. In a state that has vividly benefited from immigration and trade, a state where Latinos have for the most part prospered and contributed to the prosperity of their neighbors, white voters mobilized to elect a candidate who would angrily erase everything Latinos represent. No one else suffered that kind of defeat on Tuesday.  By  Kevin M. Kruse  With so many predictions about this presidential campaign having turned out to be so very wrong, comparisons to the 1948 presidential race come naturally. In that election, virtually everyone predicted that the Republican Thomas Dewey would beat the “accidental president,” the Democrat, Harry Truman. Pollsters reinforced these assumptions. Elmer Roper announced that he was so sure Dewey would win that he wouldn’t even bother reporting poll results anymore. “My silence on this point can be construed as an indication that Mr. Dewey is still so clearly ahead that we might as well just listen to his inaugural address,” he said. George Gallup kept polling until mid-October, but then rested on those results, assuming the race was over. Pundits agreed. Newsweek surveyed 50 of the nation’s top political reporters in October; every single one said Dewey would win. Republicans and Democrats alike assumed the race was over. On election night, the conservative Chicago Tribune was so confident it called the race early, rushing out a banner headline that would soon be as famous as it was wrong: “Dewey Defeats Truman.” To the amazement of nearly everyone, Truman won by considerable margins. In the popular vote, he took 49.6 percent to Dewey’s 45.1 percent. In the Electoral College, he won 303 votes to Dewey’s 189. While the margins of this year’s election are narrower, the shock and confusion of pollsters and analysts seems just as pronounced. But comparisons between the Truman and Trump campaigns are not neatly drawn. Truman was an outspoken liberal, and he campaigned on preserving and expanding the accomplishments of the New Deal welfare state. He called for expansion of Social Security, more progressive forms of taxation, a higher minimum wage, and a new national system of health insurance. Truman also committed the Democratic Party, long dominated by Southern segregationists, to a new racial liberalism. Notably, he called on Congress to protect the voting rights of African-Americans. In foreign policy, Truman set America against the growing influence of the Soviet Union. In 1947, he announced the Truman Doctrine, which prompted economic aid to Europe through the Marshall Plan and military alliances through a new North Atlantic Treaty Organization. A year later, Truman challenged Soviet expansionism with the Berlin Airlift. Mr. Trump has rejected much of the substance of Truman’s campaign, but in many ways he reflected its style. Truman’s famous “whistle-stop campaign” took him to rural communities and small towns where working-class and middle-class whites felt neglected. In fiery speeches with blunt language, he singled out sources of blame. Truman went after the “do nothing” Republican Congress as a prominent foe, but also denounced an array of “special interests,” including “bloodsuckers who have offices on Wall Street.” Truman named these enemies and promised to “give ’em’ hell.” His crowds believed him and rallied to their candidate. On Election Day, he predicted there were would be “a lot of surprised pollsters.” There were. Though he had reason to gloat, Truman was gracious in victory. The day after the election, the Washington Post staff invited him to a “crow banquet.” All the newspaper pundits, radio commentators and pollsters who predicted his defeat would wear sackcloth and force down a main course of crow; the president, in white tie and tails, would be served roast turkey. Truman declined, saying he had “no desire to crow over anybody or to see anybody eat crow, figuratively or otherwise.” He added, “We should all get together now and make a country in which everybody can eat turkey whenever he pleases.” Mr. Trump is not a politician who operates by anyone else’s playbook, but perhaps in this small but important matter, he can take a lesson from history.  By  Maureen Sullivan  I have to admit it: I am loving it. As the results poured in for Donald J. Trump, I reveled in the Facebook friends who openly mourned the end of humanity. I felt gleeful in trolling the Twitter hashtag #HesNotMyPresident: “I’m laying in bed with tears streaming down my face, just thinking about the future of this country.” This was one of the biggest election upsets in history, so of course everyone is stunned. Me too. Switching among three cable news networks and several websites I wondered: Is he really going to take Florida so easily? Did they just call North Carolina for Trump? Can he possibly win Wisconsin? Pennsylvania? Yup. I rooted for Mitt Romney in 2012 and John McCain in 2008. I ran for the school board in Hoboken, N.J., and lost once before winning the following year. I know what it’s like to have your hopes puddle up on the floor like that dollop of election-night Haagen-Dazs that you dropped and you just don’t care to wipe up. What does it matter? All is lost. You want to announce on Twitter that you are in bed letting the tears stream down your face. I saw this result coming over the summer. In July, five police officers were ambushed in Dallas and three more were killed in Baton Rouge. In August, Colin Kaepernick, the San Francisco 49ers quarterback, sat out the national anthem. In September, an Islamic terrorist, masquerading as a fried chicken salesman in my hometown, Elizabeth, N.J., set off bombs in New York and New Jersey. Mrs. Clinton proclaimed: “I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police.” She put half of Trump’s supporters in that “basket of deplorables.” People I know were angry. They were tired of being told they were racist and bigoted as they went about the business of mowing their lawns, writing college tuition checks and working their jobs as cops, secretaries and teachers’ aides. They kept being told they needed to look inward, examine their sins and judge themselves guilty. They had not forgotten when Barack Obama was running for president in 2008 and his wife, Michelle, said, “For the first time in my adult lifetime, I’m really proud of my country…” So now we have President-Elect Donald Trump. I supported him because he promised to curb regulations, cut taxes and appoint constitutionalists to the Supreme Court. I supported him because Mrs. Clinton doesn’t have what it takes to turn around a stagnant economy or stand up to the special interests that block innovation. In his victory speech, Mr. Trump lifted a line from Abraham Lincoln and spoke of “binding wounds.” I wanted him to be gracious and kind in that moment, and he was. My 89-year-old mother is still appalled by my vote and tells me, with a laugh, that she’s moving to Ireland. And one of my disappointed female friends on Facebook — who, like me is white and college-educated — wrote, “Obama helped expose the deeply racist nature of our country. Trump exposes the anti-intellectual, sexist xenophobia.” But most of my friends, some of whom I suspect cast votes like mine, have stayed quiet. I guess it’s still not politically correct to admit that you are on the Trump train.  By  Viet Thanh Nguyen  Worst-case scenario in the next four years: fascism, a wall, mass deportations, the end of Obamacare, a Trump brand on the White House and either a trade war or an actual war with China (since war is the easiest diversion from domestic unhappiness). Best-case scenario: Ruth Bader Ginsburg refuses to retire or die, the Democratic Party finds a backbone, turns away from its fixation on the center and heeds the call for an economic revolt against the 1 percent, joined by Black Lives Matter, the Occupy movement, and resurgent feminism. Both scenarios could happen at the same time. The second scenario requires Democrats to put their status quo political model to rest. They already had a significant portion of the nonwhite minority vote locked up, but have lost too many working-class white people. Bernie Sanders might not have won over the wealthier whites who were voting with Trump against the seemingly rising tide of minorities, but he might have snared the white working class and some of the white middle class. Here’s the bright side, for those, like me, who are on the liberal-to-left spectrum. If Hillary Clinton had won, she would have run again in 2020, which could have meant four more years of Wall Street liberalism and fire-and-forget perpetual warfare, conducted by drones and Special Operations over the horizon. Now perhaps Elizabeth Warren will be the 2020 Democratic candidate — a white woman, a feminist, and someone more progressive than Clinton. But all this speaks largely about domestic electoral politics. The sickness of the American body politic remains untreated, and will remain untreated, or exacerbated, in a country run by clowns, conspirators, and collaborators. That sickness is imperialism. America is an imperial country, and its decay might now be showing. The power that has brought so much benefit to the country — for white people — is now faltering in its ability to provide those benefits to all white people. The empire’s best hope is to be more inclusive, demographically and economically, but that runs counter to the imperial impulse to hoard power and profit. Warren or someone like her might be better at extracting more social and economic justice for all Americans. But unless such a person finds a way to ease control from the financial-industrial complex, the prospects of halting our decline are weak. Empires rot from the inside even as emperors blame the barbarians.  By  Robert N. Stavins  Donald J. Trump once tweeted that “the concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing noncompetitive.” Twitter messages may not be clear signs of likely public policies, but Mr. Trump followed up during the campaign with his “America First Energy Plan,” which would rescind all of President Obama’s actions on climate change. The plan includes canceling United States participation in the Paris climate agreement and stopping all American funding of United Nations climate change programs. It also includes abandoning the Clean Power Plan, a mainstay of the Obama administration’s approach to achieving its emissions reduction target for carbon dioxide under the Paris agreement. What should we make of such campaign promises? Taking Mr. Trump at his word, he will surely seek to pull the country out of the Paris pact. But because the agreement has already come into force, under the rules, any party must wait three years before requesting to withdraw, followed by a one-year notice period. Those rules would seem to be mere technicalities. The incoming Trump administration simply can disregard America’s pledge to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 26 to 28 percent below the 2005 level by 2025. That is bad enough. But the big worry is what other key countries, including the world’s largest emitter, China, as well as India and Brazil, will do if the United States reneges on its pledge. The result could be that the Paris agreement unravels, taking it from the 97 percent of global emissions currently covered by the pact to little more than the European Union’s 10 percent share. In addition, Mr. Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency probably will stop work on regulations of methane emissions (a very potent greenhouse gas) from existing oil and gas operations. Undoing complex existing regulations, such as the Clean Power Plan, will be more difficult, but a reconstituted Supreme Court will probably help President Trump when that plan inevitably comes before the court. Also, the new president will most likely ask that the Keystone XL pipeline permit application be renewed — and facilitate other oil and gas pipelines around the country. On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump promised to “bring back” the coal industry by cutting environmental regulations. That may not be so easy. The decline of that industry and related employment has been caused by technological changes in mining, and competition from low-priced natural gas for electricity generation, not by environmental regulations. At the same time, Mr. Trump has pledged to promote fracking for oil and gas, but that would make natural gas even more economically attractive, and accelerate the elimination of coal-sector jobs. If he lives up to his campaign rhetoric, Mr. Trump may indeed be able to reverse course on climate change policy, increasing the threat to our planet, and in the process destroy much of the Obama legacy in this important realm. This will make the states even more important players on this critical issue.  By  Dani Rodrik  The real costs of a Donald J. Trump presidency will most likely come on the political rather than on the economic side. We are likely to see some rise in trade barriers and unilateral economic policies. But for all his bluster, I do not expect Mr. Trump to engage in indiscriminate protectionism. We live in a world of supply chains where imposing tariffs on Mexican or Chinese imports will raise costs of United States businesses and make it hard for them to compete. Mr. Trump is a businessman, and he will understand soon, if he does not now, the senselessness of blanket protectionism. We may have plenty of trade disputes with foreign countries. It’s useful to bear in mind here the example of the 1980s, when trade frictions with Japan and other leading exporters produced a slew of so-called new protectionist barriers such as voluntary export restraints. But these did very limited damage to the world economy. Before long, the world embarked on a further and more intense round of globalization. Furthermore, we have robust international institutions, like the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization, that did not exist in the interwar period. And the political lobbies in favor of an open economy (big business and banks) are stronger and retain considerable influence in Washington. So even though the 1930s parallel is on everyone’s mind, I do not think we are in for a collapse of the international economic order and a retreat into trade war. The real danger Mr. Trump poses is the undermining of our politics — the norms that sustain our liberal democracies. His campaign was based on a divisive politics of identity. Ideals of equity, equal rights, diversity and inclusion were submerged under the weight of a rhetoric that raised racial and ethnic tensions and inflamed passions against imagined enemies — Mexican immigrants, Chinese exporters, Muslim refugees. Illiberal democracy has been the bane of several nations around the world. Under Mr. Trump, the traditions in the United States of checks and balances and of rule of law will be tested seriously. The political danger will be greatly magnified by Mr. Trump’s likely economic failure. He comes into office as the putative leader of middle and lower classes who feel they have been left behind. He has raised their expectations in ways that he cannot meet. There is little chance that incomes at the middle and lower end of income distribution will receive a large boost under his policies. The manufacturing jobs that have left will not return no matter how tough Mr. Trump’s trade policies get. These jobs have disappeared for good, largely thanks to technological changes, and not trade. When the full scale of his economic disappointment sinks in sometime during his term, Mr. Trump may well react in the time-honored fashion of global populists like President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. To keep his base mobilized and insulate himself from economic troubles, he may take shelter in an intensified form of the identity politics that worked so well for him during the presidential campaign. This would rip American society further apart along racial and ethnic cleavages. The ugliness that characterized politics during the presidential campaign may be nothing compared with what may be yet to come.  By  Teresa Tritch  Financial markets regained their footing on Wednesday, as investors and traders apparently concluded that a Donald Trump presidency might not be so bad after all. Instead of focusing on how unprepared Mr. Trump is to be president, several traders quoted in the media talked about how deregulation from ending Obamacare and the Dodd-Frank financial reforms — two Republican goals — could lift stock prices for health care companies and banks. They took special solace in Mr. Trump’s promise to boost government spending on infrastructure and in the measured tones of his acceptance speech. Unfortunately, there is no escaping the overarching conclusion that Mr. Trump’s campaign promises, if carried out, would harm the economy. His proposed rollback of Dodd-Frank reforms would invite renewed recklessness. His opposition to Obamacare would renew and intensify households’ financial insecurity. His proposed tax cuts for the rich would exacerbate income inequality, while either blowing a hole in the deficit or requiring deep budget cuts. His stance on trade would impair international commerce and cooperation. His proposed deportation of immigrants would unleash a legal and humanitarian crisis. Even his popular call for more infrastructure spending is flawed. In and of itself, Mr. Trump’s pledge to borrow vast sums to spend on infrastructure would be a sensible move at this time of low interest rates. But vastly increased federal indebtedness in addition to his other harmful economic policies would be piling risk on top of risk. Risk-taking that crosses the line into recklessness can be immensely profitable in the short run, which is what many traders care most about. But it is no way to run an economy on which everyone else depends for long-term prosperity.  By  Emily Bazelon  Now it looks like a warning shot. When Justice Antonin Scalia died in February, Donald Trump was among the first to call for stonewalling President Obama’s choice to fill the seat. “It’s called delay, delay, delay,” he said at the opening of the Republican presidential debate on Feb. 13. Senator Harry Reid, the minority leader, countered that it would be “unprecedented in recent history” for the Supreme Court to go a year without a full complement of justices. But other Republicans, chief among them the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, agreed with Mr. Trump and Senator Ted Cruz: Justice Scalia’s seat should remain vacant until after the election. Undeterred (what else was he supposed to be?), President Obama nominated Merrick Garland, a seasoned judge praised in the past by Republicans like Senator Orrin Hatch. A debate ensued over historical facts, which seems quaintly polite in retrospect. Since 1900, had the Senate ever refused to confirm a nominee in a presidential election year as a result of the impending election? The answer was no (even if Mr. Cruz tried to argue, against the facts, that Justice Anthony Kennedy wasn’t confirmed in the election year of 1988.) The Republicans’ refusal to grant Judge Garland a hearing or schedule a vote was in fact unprecedented. It was a new kind of hardball. And it succeeded. For a blip in August, Republicans took a hit in the polls for  obstructing the Garland nomination. But the moment passed, blown away in the chaos and battle of the presidential election. Judge Garland slipped from view. The parties adapted to a new reality in which both expected either his postelection, pre-inauguration confirmation, or a new nominee chosen by the next president. When they assumed Hillary Clinton would win, Republicans including Senators John McCain of Arizona  and Richard Burr of North Carolina talked about blocking Democratic Supreme Court picks indefinitely. Both were re-elected Tuesday and will return to a Senate still controlled by the Republicans. It’s hard to see how any Republican paid a price for radically altering the norms for Supreme Court appointments. Mr. Trump helped point the way, and the voters rewarded him and those who followed. Choosing a justice in Antonin Scalia’s mold, as he has promised, will allow Mr. Trump to prove himself to the social conservatives for whom the court, and Roe v. Wade, are the defining issues. Under the current rules, Democrats could filibuster his choice, but if that happens, how long will those rules last? 
Mr. Trump’s election has already run over far stronger traditions and norms. Next comes the question of how many additional Supreme Court appointments will come his way. Ruth Bader Ginsburg is 83. Anthony Kennedy is 80. Stephen Breyer is 78. In Supreme Court terms, four years is a long time.  By  Peter Wehner  To say that Donald Trump’s victory was a shock may qualify as the understatement of the century. The polls were wrong. The experts were wrong. I was wrong. Almost everyone was wrong — including those in the Trump campaign who expected to lose. His victory wasn’t just a surprise; it was an event of gigantic dimensions, its radiating effects incalculable. Mr. Trump’s win ranks among the most unlikely and stunning elections in American history. Regardless of how the Trump presidency turns out, this race will be studied a century from now. For those of us who have been vehement critics of Mr. Trump, this is a rather challenging moment. Starting on Jan. 20, he will be the only president we have. He now has a democratic legitimacy we may regret but cannot deny, and there is such a thing as democratic grace. To those who are tempted only to rage and attack and lament what has occurred, a word of counsel to them, and to myself: We need to give Mr. Trump the chance to rise to the moment, as unlikely as we think that may be. At the same time, we can’t possibly erase the history of the last 17 months — the words he said, the things he did, the conspiracy theories he wove, the ignorance, volatility and cruelty he showed — and our concerns aren’t going to evaporate now that he’s about to be in charge of the nuclear triad that during the campaign he didn’t even know existed. I believed, and still believe, that he is a man with a disordered personality and authoritarian tendencies. My job is to give him a chance to prove me wrong; his job is to prove me wrong. Among my worries is that Mr. Trump’s victory will validate his style of politics, his serrated rhetoric. The way he mistreats people will be normalized. This election has brought us to dark places. Rather than this approach being repudiated it will, for many, become a model. “All the decent drapery of life is to be rudely torn off,” in the words of Edmund Burke. If the Trump campaign foreshadows his presidency, America under Trump will be fundamentally different than it has been — coarser, less temperate and civilized, more inward and resentful. The Republican Party will fundamentally change, from a conservative party to one that champions European-style ethnic nationalism. (The Democratic Party, whose members were certain Hillary Clinton would win, will be convulsed as it enters a period of intense recrimination.) A few hours after Mr. Trump was declared the winner, I received a note from a friend of mine, the distinguished Christian writer Philip Yancey, who told me, “I’m surprised and befuddled, but not scared, thanks to the checks-and-balances strength of American democracy. I tremble, though, to think what an unpredictable leader offers to a world in growing crisis.” He added, “Some say God moves in mysterious ways.  I say, God grants humans the freedom to move in even more mysterious ways.” What happened on Nov. 8th was a mystery that may lead to calamity. I hope to God it won’t.  By  Anna North  I spent the days leading up to the election in Pennsylvania talking to some young voters , 18, 19, 20 years old. They wore flowered Doc Martens, fake fur coats, earbuds dangling from one ear. Overwhelmingly, they were open and polite. They were smart. They were angry at a political system they felt ignored them, but they hoped for better days ahead. In January, Donald Trump will be their next president. Many of these young people supported Mr. Trump. Many did so reluctantly. One young Trump supporter told me that no one knows exactly what Mr. Trump will do in office. Another described hesitating while filling out his absentee ballot, wondering if he could vote for a man who had made abhorrent comments about women. But some voted for Mr. Trump enthusiastically. Those who supported Hillary Clinton were disgusted by Mr. Trump and what he stands for. Today, they’re dealing with a new reality they didn’t expect. I’m thinking of Bria Blackshear, a 20-year-old Temple University student who had waited more than an hour at her polling place in north Philadelphia. “Donald Trump doesn’t represent the ideals I would want for this country,” she said. I’m thinking of Brooke Renner, 18, also a Temple student, who was waiting in line for a second time. She’d given up earlier, but was back and willing to wait as long as it took to cast her vote for Mrs. Clinton. Otherwise, she said, “I’d feel personally responsible if Donald Trump wins.” I’m thinking of Sierra Taylor, a 19-year-old student at the Community College of Philadelphia, who said, “black people feel like our votes don’t matter.” I’m thinking of her friend Naiya Johnson, 22, who, when asked about her hopes for the next four years, said, “I hope we make it.” I’m also thinking of the young people I saw debating the issues that matter to them. Of the table full of young men at Bucks County Community College arguing about Mr. Trump when one, the quietest, spoke up to say, “Trump has no respect for women.” Of the young man, who, as his friend criticized Mrs. Clinton’s record as secretary of state, interjected that Mr. Trump is racist, sexist and xenophobic. They’d had the argument once before, they said. I hope they keep talking. I think they will. It’s a frightening time to grow up. But these young voters are clear-eyed about the shortcomings of government and optimistic enough to imagine a better world. They can make friends with people of different viewpoints, and, when it matters, they can challenge their friends to think in a new way.  By  Seamus McGraw  BRODHEADSVILLE, Pa. — Thinking back now, I can’t for the life of me figure out how I got it so wrong. He seemed so troubled by what he was about to do, as if he knew it was a mistake, but one he felt compelled to make. The way I read the pained look on his face, I thought he was almost apologizing; maybe seeking a kind of absolution. It was just a few days before the election, and I had been canvassing for the Democrats. I wasn’t out there because I was a particularly ardent Clinton supporter. She had certainly not been my first choice, my second or even my third. I’m one of those middle-aged white men without a college degree who had been holding out for Joe Biden to change his mind. But I felt as if I had an obligation to make certain that, at least in my little corner of Pennsylvania, a man who was, to my mind, so obviously unsuited to the highest office in the world, was not just defeated, but repudiated. I expected that my neighbors and friends and the strangers down the road would do just that. Sure, I could feel and even share their frustration over the fact that the longest postwar economic recovery had left so many of my neighbors behind. I had been left behind, too. And yes, I understood the fear of an uncertain world, and the stress of profound cultural changes that were upending so many things that my neighbors took as bedrock values. But I thought the character traits that had always defined the people I knew in eastern Pennsylvania — true conservatives with a sense of responsibility and decency — would in the end lead them to reject “Trumpism,” whatever that actually is. My job wasn’t to help Clinton win. I thought — or at least the pundits were telling me — that was a done deal. The way I saw it, my only task was to drive up her margins and to do that, I was working off a carefully curated list of likely Clinton voters thoughtfully provided to me by the local campaign office. And so when I knocked on this gentleman’s door on a back road in the rural, conservative West End of Monroe County, and he told me that he was indeed planning on voting for Donald Trump, I was ready to simply turn away. But he wouldn’t let me go. “I just can’t trust her,” he said. He made eye contact and kept it. Relentlessly. He and I were of the same rough demographic. Just like me, he was well into his 50s, with teeth that had seen better days. Just like me, he was lower middle class, judging from his surroundings. And as he rattled off a list of shopworn talking points — Benghazi, emails, pay for play — I felt as if I was hearing a stranger’s confession. I felt as if he wanted me to understand and forgive him for what he was about to do. I remember thinking to myself that when this was over, I was going to have to find a way to build a bridge back to this guy who was, in so many ways, just like me. Such was my arrogance. Late last night, as I watched Pennsylvania turn red for the first time in a generation, I kept thinking back to that man, and how I so misread his expression and his words. It wasn’t sorrow etched in his face. It was pity. For me. Because he knew, long before I did, how wrong I was.  —  Seamus McGraw is the author of “Betting the Farm on a Drought.”   By  Beverly Gage  In his victory speech last night, Donald J. Trump paid homage to “the forgotten men and women of our country,” vowing that they “will be forgotten no longer.” This essential political idea — that a vast segment of the nation’s white citizens have been overlooked, or looked down upon — has driven every major realignment in American politics since the New Deal. In 1932, at the darkest moment of the Great Depression, Franklin Roosevelt evoked the “forgotten man” as a reason to rebuild the economy from the “bottom up.” More than three decades later, after Richard Nixon’s 1968 victory, the journalist Peter Schrag identified the “Forgotten American” — the white “lower middle class” voter — as the key to the nation’s apparent rejection of the Great Society and the New Deal order. “In the guise of the working class — or the American yeoman or John Smith — he was once the hero of the civic books, the man that Andrew Jackson called ‘the bone and sinew of the country,’ ” Mr. Schrag wrote. “Now he is ‘the forgotten man,’ perhaps the most alienated person in America.” That this “forgotten” American could be used both to uphold and to dismantle liberalism suggests that this American political identity has never been especially fixed: Democrat or Republican, liberal or conservative, but populist above all. Since the 1960s, the phrase has also implied that the country was paying too much attention to the wrong sorts of people — most notably, to African-Americans — at the expense of the white working class.
It is no coincidence that the “forgotten men and women of our country” began their migration into the Republican Party at the very moment that African-Americans were asserting their right to vote, and voting Democratic, in large numbers for the first time. Mr. Trump’s victory will go down as one of the great upsets in United States history, but it is also the product of a long and bitter struggle over race and class in this country. The Yale sociologist William Graham Sumner is often credited with coining the term “forgotten man.” Writing near the dawn of the Progressive Era, he lamented the lost autonomy of hard-working citizens suddenly forced to pay for high-flown programs of social reform. Sumner’s most famous political essay, “What the Social Classes Owe to Each Other,” rejected the very idea that government might mitigate class antagonisms by sharing the social wealth. What did social classes owe to each other? Not much, in Sumner’s view. And his “forgotten man” owed the least of all. In his 1932 campaign for the presidency, Roosevelt sought to claim the term for a different and more expansive purpose. “These unhappy times call for the building of plans that rest upon the forgotten,” he said in a radio address from Albany in April 1932, for plans “that build from the bottom up and not from the top down, that put their faith once more in the forgotten man at the bottom of the economic pyramid.” To Roosevelt, the “forgotten man” encompassed the industrial worker and struggling farmer and Keynesian consumer — ordinary citizens without whom a modern economy would falter. He built the New Deal around this image, establishing the minimum wage, Social Security and the federal right to organize unions. Those reforms cemented the loyalty of the white working class to the Democratic Party for a generation. But the New Deal also “forgot” — or excluded — many people, including African-Americans. When the Great Society came along, Lyndon Johnson tried to make up for that by expanding federal programs serving the poor and by championing the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts. As the country started to “remember” its long-delayed promises of equality, however, the “forgotten American” began to emerge as term of exclusion and resistance to change. “There is hardly a language to describe him, or even a set of social statistics,” Mr. Schrag wrote in his August 1969 essay, “ The Forgotten American .” “Just names: racist-bigot-redneck-ethnic-Irish-Italian-Pole-Hunkie-Yahoo. The lower middle class. A blank.” As Mr. Schrag noted, all of that name-calling was part of the problem, a refusal on the part of liberal elites to recognize the real grievances and desires of what had once been a bedrock Democratic constituency. In the 1968 campaign, Nixon capitalized on this resentment with calls for “law and order,” a phrase that evoked not only fears of crime, but also anger at protesters and rioters and the college-campus liberals who tolerated them. Mr. Trump put that phrase back into political circulation in 2016, a gesture of solidarity with the old ways of thinking about the “silent majority” — and the “forgotten American.” And though he included “men and women” in his victory speech, Mr. Trump’s campaign mobilized around the same image that once animated the Roosevelt coalition: the “forgotten” white working-class man. Race, too, remains an indelible part of today’s conversation about who has been “forgotten” and who deserves to be seen. To dismiss this language as simple racism, however, is to miss at least some of its political significance. What happened in the late 1960s and 1970s was not only that the Republican Party reclaimed and redefined Roosevelt’s “forgotten man” for a more conservative age. During those years, the Democratic Party itself began to turn away from the New Deal and its working-class politics, especially from its commitment to organized labor. With Mr. Trump’s election, we may be witnessing the rise of a new party system, with the Democrats now the standard-bearers of racial tolerance and free-market globalization, and the Republicans the party of nationalist populist revolt. But as Roosevelt showed, this need not be a fixed political equation. If the 2016 election marks the final, gasping end of the New Deal coalition, it should also mark the start of a new reckoning within the Democratic Party.  By  Helen Lewis  LONDON — You can’t throw a peanut in a Westminster pub without hitting an obsessive follower of American politics. Start a conversation about “The West Wing” with any member of Parliament and expect to get a long disquisition on that American political drama’s best episodes. During Britain’s last general election, in 2015, both main political parties here proudly boasted about being advised by veterans of Barack Obama’s campaign. Until now, our Americophilia has been unrequited. Then in August, Donald J. Trump declared himself “Mr. Brexit.” For Mr. Trump and his supporters, Britain’s vote in June to leave the European Union was evidence of a growing popular revolt against multiculturalism, porous borders and political elites. If the British electorate could deliver a result that baffled its financial sector, its scientists and metropolitan liberals – and was not widely predicted by pollsters – couldn’t the same sort of upset happen in America? It just did. Mr. Trump’s victory feels like a flashback to June, although where Brexit divided members of Britain’s political class, the American election results have united them. Politicians of the mainstream right and left alike are dumbfounded that the United States  would elect someone who uses the extreme language Mr. Trump does and who seems to have little love for institutions like NATO. Last December, Britain’s former Conservative prime minister, David Cameron, described Mr. Trump’s proposed ban on Muslims entering America as “divisive, stupid and wrong.” The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan of the Labour Party, has called the president-elect’s views on Islam “ignorant.” Apart from Nigel Farage, the face of the far-right U.K. Independence Party, it is difficult to find a British politician with a good word to say about Mr. Trump. Nationalism, white anger and protectionism are now driving politics in Britain and across Europe. The sound is of doors slamming. Brexit felt like a referendum on border control, and on rapid demographic change among white communities that felt themselves deprived of attention and resources. It is tempting to draw comparisons with the United States: The big cities in both Britain and the United States, which are most diverse, are also most relaxed about that diversity. In smaller communities, immigration feels more disruptive. There are other parallels. Mr. Trump’s victory was driven by older, white voters, who were struggling but not destitute. He won white men without college degrees by a landslide. A typical Leave supporter has a similar demographic profile. Such voters are on the decline, as both Britain and the United States become more diverse and younger generations are better-educated, and more open to immigration and change. But as both the Brexit vote and Mr. Trump’s victory showed, they are far from a spent force.  By  Susan Chira  Women, as Hillary Clinton showed this morning , know how to absorb pain. And Mrs. Clinton has had plenty of practice about how to stand before the cameras after public humiliation. Clearly, she needed time to compose herself. She made no appearances overnight, instead calling Donald J. Trump to concede. But when she strode onstage in purple and gray, Bill Clinton behind her in a purple tie, her voice did not waver. Women seldom have the luxury of giving in to pain. Many have children or grandchildren or aging parents to tend, whether they themselves are sick or in emotional turmoil. So Mrs. Clinton faced her despondent campaign staff and her despondent half of the country and tried to rally them. She spoke most directly to young people, and to women and girls. She had hoped to stand before them as a symbol of all that women could achieve. Now she had to demonstrate once again what women can endure. “I’ve had successes and setbacks, sometimes really painful ones,” she told them. It was hard not to recall her standing beside Bill Clinton after the whole world knew graphic and humiliating details about the affairs he had denied having. “To all the women and especially the young women who put their faith in me I want you to know that nothing has made me prouder than to be your champion,” she said, and here she had to clear her throat. “I know we still have not shattered that highest and hardest glass ceiling but some day somebody will, and hopefully sooner than we might think right now.” It’s difficult to know right now all that stood in the way of shattering that ceiling. Was it a woman, or this woman? Was it Mrs. Clinton as symbol of the Washington establishment, as a consummate insider in a time of profound distrust of the elite? We do know that voters disproportionately punish women who are seen as dishonest. We do know that it’s hard for strong, assertive and ambitious women to be seen as likable and competent at the same time. Political scientists and cultural commentators will long debate what happened in this election, to this woman and to many women.  The question is whether the image of Mrs. Clinton, composed and gracious in defeat, persevering through pain, will inspire women to try again?  By  Felix Salmon  Markets always move after seismic events, like the unexpected election of Donald J. Trump. Still, market moves need to be interpreted. Even if you believe that markets are right, it’s not always obvious what they’re saying. One way to think about the market’s gyrations is the idea of mean and variation. When Barack Obama (a.k.a. No Drama Obama) was elected president, it was possible to anticipate — correctly, it turned out — that he would help steer America back onto a course of steady growth, low inflation and falling unemployment. Think of that as the Obama mean: the baseline expectation. When the stock market expects good things like that, it tends to rise, just as it has during the Obama presidency. But the variation is just as important as the mean. Mr. Obama didn’t always give the markets what they wanted, but by the same token he was always clear about what he was going to do. He promised them something much more valuable: a low-risk upward economic trajectory. Mr. Trump is the exact opposite of Mr. Obama. His baseline is worse, for starters: to establish expectations for his presidency, you have to factor in his hugely irresponsible fiscal policy, potential trade wars and maybe even reckless brinkmanship over repaying the national debt. Put those things together, and a severe recession becomes possible. But it gets even worse because Mr. Trump is by his nature highly unpredictable. However bad you think he’s going to be, it’s entirely possible that your prediction will turn out to be ridiculously optimistic. Mr. Trump has vastly more downside risk than Mr. Obama ever had, and so markets are going to trade at a discount to his already-discounted baseline. If you transition, then, from low-risk positive expectations to high-risk negative expectations, you have to expect the markets to take some precipitous plunges along the way. Much of that will be noise. The markets always fluctuate randomly in the short term, and there’s no point in trying to read anything meaningful into those moves. That’s why it’s dangerous to read too much into midnight stock-market futures trading, or a sudden plunge in the value of the Mexican peso once it becomes obvious that Mr. Trump will become president. Those moves might be a rational response to the lower expected value of the assets in question. On the other hand, they might just be the result of panicky hedging — or indeed they could simply represent dealers second-guessing and trying to outmaneuver one another. Once the market has been trading steadily for a few months, its general direction under the auspices of the new government is going to be pretty clear. Fluctuations over just a few hours, by contrast, are much harder to read. They might look like signals — but all too often they turn out to be nothing but noise. And as we’ve learned during this long, brutal election, separating noise from signals can be a very tricky business.  By  Michael Lerner  It turns out that shaming the supporters of Donald J. Trump is not a good political strategy. Though job loss and economic stagnation played a role in his victory, so did shame. As the principal investigator on a study of the middle class for the National Institute of Mental Health, I found that working people’s stress is often intensified by shame at their failure to “make it” in what they are taught is a meritocratic American economy. The right has been very successful at persuading working people that they are vulnerable not because they themselves have failed, but because of the selfishness of some other villain (African-Americans, feminists, immigrants, Muslims, Jews, liberals, progressives; the list keeps growing). Instead of challenging this ideology of shame, the left has buttressed it by blaming white people as a whole for slavery, genocide of the Native Americans and a host of other sins, as though whiteness itself was something about which people ought to be ashamed. The rage many white working-class people feel in response is rooted in the sense that once again, as has happened to them throughout their lives, they are being misunderstood. So please understand what is happening here. Many Trump supporters very legitimately feel that it is they who have been facing an unfair reality. The upper 20 percent of income earners, many of them quite liberal and rightly committed to the defense of minorities and immigrants, also believe in the economic meritocracy and their own right to have so much more than those who are less fortunate. So while they may be progressive on issues of discrimination against the obvious victims of racism and sexism, they are blind to their own class privilege and to the hidden injuries of class that are internalized by much of the country as self-blame. The right’s ability to portray liberals as elitists is further strengthened by the phobia toward religion that prevails in the left. Many religious people are drawn by the teachings of their tradition to humane values and caring about the oppressed. Yet they often find that liberal culture is hostile to religion of any sort, believing it is irrational and filled with hate. People on the left rarely open themselves to the possibility that there could be a spiritual crisis in society that plays a role in the lives of many who feel misunderstood and denigrated by the fancy intellectuals and radical activists. The left needs to stop ignoring people’s inner pain and fear. The racism, sexism and xenophobia used by Mr. Trump to advance his candidacy does not reveal an inherent malice in the majority of Americans. If the left could abandon all this shaming, it could rebuild its political base by helping Americans see that much of people’s suffering is rooted in the hidden injuries of class and in the spiritual crisis that the global competitive marketplace generates. Democrats need to become as conscious and articulate about the suffering caused by classism as we are about other forms of suffering. We need to reach out to Trump voters in a spirit of empathy and contrition. Only then can we help working people understand that they do not live in a meritocracy, that their intuition that the system is rigged is correct (but it is not by those whom they had been taught to blame) and that their pain and rage is legitimate."
"Text: Obama’s Speech on National Security","Advertisement MAY 21, 2009  THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning, everybody.  Please be seated.  Thank you all for being here.  Let me just acknowledge the presence of some of my outstanding Cabinet members and advisors.  We've got our Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton.  We have our CIA Director Leon Panetta.  We have our Secretary of Defense William Gates (sic); Secretary Napolitano of Department of Homeland Security; Attorney General Eric Holder; my National Security Advisor Jim Jones.  And I want to especially thank our Acting Archivist of the United States, Adrienne Thomas. I also want to acknowledge several members of the House who have great interest in intelligence matters.  I want to thank Congressman Reyes, Congressman Hoekstra, Congressman King, as well as Congressman Thompson, for being here today.  Thank you so much. These are extraordinary times for our country.  We're confronting a historic economic crisis.  We're fighting two wars.  We face a range of challenges that will define the way that Americans will live in the 21st century.  So there's no shortage of work to be done, or responsibilities to bear. Advertisement And we've begun to make progress.  Just this week, we've taken steps to protect American consumers and homeowners, and to reform our system of government contracting so that we better protect our people while spending our money more wisely.  (Applause.)  The -- it's a good bill.  (Laughter.)  The engines of our economy are slowly beginning to turn, and we're working towards historic reform on health care and on energy.  I want to say to the members of Congress, I welcome all the extraordinary work that has been done over these last four months on these and other issues. Advertisement In the midst of all these challenges, however, my single most important responsibility as President is to keep the American people safe.  It's the first thing that I think about when I wake up in the morning.  It's the last thing that I think about when I go to sleep at night. And this responsibility is only magnified in an era when an extremist ideology threatens our people, and technology gives a handful of terrorists the potential to do us great harm.  We are less than eight years removed from the deadliest attack on American soil in our history.  We know that al Qaeda is actively planning to attack us again.  We know that this threat will be with us for a long time, and that we must use all elements of our power to defeat it. Already, we've taken several steps to achieve that goal.  For the first time since 2002, we're providing the necessary resources and strategic direction to take the fight to the extremists who attacked us on 9/11 in Afghanistan and Pakistan.  We're investing in the 21st century military and intelligence capabilities that will allow us to stay one step ahead of a nimble enemy.  We have re-energized a global non-proliferation regime to deny the world's most dangerous people access to the world's deadliest weapons.  And we've launched an effort to secure all loose nuclear materials within four years.  We're better protecting our border, and increasing our preparedness for any future attack or natural disaster.  We're building new partnerships around the world to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al Qaeda and its affiliates.  And we have renewed American diplomacy so that we once again have the strength and standing to truly lead the world. These steps are all critical to keeping America secure.  But I believe with every fiber of my being that in the long run we also cannot keep this country safe unless we enlist the power of our most fundamental values.  The documents that we hold in this very hall -- the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights -- these are not simply words written into aging parchment.  They are the foundation of liberty and justice in this country, and a light that shines for all who seek freedom, fairness, equality, and dignity around the world. I stand here today as someone whose own life was made possible by these documents.  My father came to these shores in search of the promise that they offered.  My mother made me rise before dawn to learn their truths when I lived as a child in a foreign land.  My own American journey was paved by generations of citizens who gave meaning to those simple words -- "to form a more perfect union."  I've studied the Constitution as a student, I've taught it as a teacher, I've been bound by it as a lawyer and a legislator.  I took an oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution as Commander-in-Chief, and as a citizen, I know that we must never, ever, turn our back on its enduring principles for expedience sake. I make this claim not simply as a matter of idealism.  We uphold our most cherished values not only because doing so is right, but because it strengthens our country and it keeps us safe.  Time and again, our values have been our best national security asset -- in war and peace; in times of ease and in eras of upheaval. Fidelity to our values is the reason why the United States of America grew from a small string of colonies under the writ of an empire to the strongest nation in the world. Advertisement It's the reason why enemy soldiers have surrendered to us in battle, knowing they'd receive better treatment from America's Armed Forces than from their own government. It's the reason why America has benefitted from strong alliances that amplified our power, and drawn a sharp, moral contrast with our adversaries. It's the reason why we've been able to overpower the iron fist of fascism and outlast the iron curtain of communism, and enlist free nations and free peoples everywhere in the common cause and common effort of liberty. From Europe to the Pacific, we've been the nation that has shut down torture chambers and replaced tyranny with the rule of law.  That is who we are.  And where terrorists offer only the injustice of disorder and destruction, America must demonstrate that our values and our institutions are more resilient than a hateful ideology. After 9/11, we knew that we had entered a new era -- that enemies who did not abide by any law of war would present new challenges to our application of the law; that our government would need new tools to protect the American people, and that these tools would have to allow us to prevent attacks instead of simply prosecuting those who try to carry them out. Unfortunately, faced with an uncertain threat, our government made a series of hasty decisions.  I believe that many of these decisions were motivated by a sincere desire to protect the American people.  But I also believe that all too often our government made decisions based on fear rather than foresight; that all too often our government trimmed facts and evidence to fit ideological predispositions.  Instead of strategically applying our power and our principles, too often we set those principles aside as luxuries that we could no longer afford.  And during this season of fear, too many of us -- Democrats and Republicans, politicians, journalists, and citizens -- fell silent. In other words, we went off course.  And this is not my assessment alone.  It was an assessment that was shared by the American people who nominated candidates for President from both major parties who, despite our many differences, called for a new approach -- one that rejected torture and one that recognized the imperative of closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay. Now let me be clear:  We are indeed at war with al Qaeda and its affiliates.  We do need to update our institutions to deal with this threat.  But we must do so with an abiding confidence in the rule of law and due process; in checks and balances and accountability.  For reasons that I will explain, the decisions that were made over the last eight years established an ad hoc legal approach for fighting terrorism that was neither effective nor sustainable -- a framework that failed to rely on our legal traditions and time-tested institutions, and that failed to use our values as a compass.  And that's why I took several steps upon taking office to better protect the American people. Advertisement First, I banned the use of so-called enhanced interrogation techniques by the United States of America.  (Applause.) I know some have argued that brutal methods like waterboarding were necessary to keep us safe.  I could not disagree more.  As Commander-in-Chief, I see the intelligence.  I bear the responsibility for keeping this country safe.  And I categorically reject the assertion that these are the most effective means of interrogation.  (Applause.)  What's more, they undermine the rule of law.  They alienate us in the world.  They serve as a recruitment tool for terrorists, and increase the will of our enemies to fight us, while decreasing the will of others to work with America.  They risk the lives of our troops by making it less likely that others will surrender to them in battle, and more likely that Americans will be mistreated if they are captured.  In short, they did not advance our war and counterterrorism efforts -- they undermined them, and that is why I ended them once and for all.  (Applause.) Now, I should add, the arguments against these techniques did not originate from my administration.  As Senator McCain once said, torture "serves as a great propaganda tool for those who recruit people to fight against us."  And even under President Bush, there was recognition among members of his own administration -- including a Secretary of State, other senior officials, and many in the military and intelligence community -- that those who argued for these tactics were on the wrong side of the debate, and the wrong side of history.  That's why we must leave these methods where they belong -- in the past.  They are not who we are, and they are not America. The second decision that I made was to order the closing of the prison camp at Guantanamo Bay.  (Applause.) For over seven years, we have detained hundreds of people at Guantanamo.  During that time, the system of military commissions that were in place at Guantanamo succeeded in convicting a grand total of three suspected terrorists.  Let me repeat that:  three convictions in over seven years.  Instead of bringing terrorists to justice, efforts at prosecution met setback after setback, cases lingered on, and in 2006 the Supreme Court invalidated the entire system.  Meanwhile, over 525 detainees were released from Guantanamo under not my administration, under the previous administration.  Let me repeat that:  Two-thirds of the detainees were released before I took office and ordered the closure of Guantanamo. There is also no question that Guantanamo set back the moral authority that is America's strongest currency in the world.  Instead of building a durable framework for the struggle against al Qaeda that drew upon our deeply held values and traditions, our government was defending positions that undermined the rule of law.  In fact, part of the rationale for establishing Guantanamo in the first place was the misplaced notion that a prison there would be beyond the law -- a proposition that the Supreme Court soundly rejected.  Meanwhile, instead of serving as a tool to counter terrorism, Guantanamo became a symbol that helped al Qaeda recruit terrorists to its cause.  Indeed, the existence of Guantanamo likely created more terrorists around the world than it ever detained. So the record is clear:  Rather than keeping us safer, the prison at Guantanamo has weakened American national security.  It is a rallying cry for our enemies.  It sets back the willingness of our allies to work with us in fighting an enemy that operates in scores of countries.  By any measure, the costs of keeping it open far exceed the complications involved in closing it.  That's why I argued that it should be closed throughout my campaign, and that is why I ordered it closed within one year. The third decision that I made was to order a review of all pending cases at Guantanamo.  I knew when I ordered Guantanamo closed that it would be difficult and complex.  There are 240 people there who have now spent years in legal limbo.  In dealing with this situation, we don't have the luxury of starting from scratch.  We're cleaning up something that is, quite simply, a mess -- a misguided experiment that has left in its wake a flood of legal challenges that my administration is forced to deal with on a constant, almost daily basis, and it consumes the time of government officials whose time should be spent on better protecting our country. Advertisement Indeed, the legal challenges that have sparked so much debate in recent weeks here in Washington would be taking place whether or not I decided to close Guantanamo.  For example, the court order to release 17 Uighurs -- 17 Uighur detainees took place last fall, when George Bush was President.  The Supreme Court that invalidated the system of prosecution at Guantanamo in 2006 was overwhelmingly appointed by Republican Presidents -- not wild-eyed liberals.  In other words, the problem of what to do with Guantanamo detainees was not caused by my decision to close the facility; the problem exists because of the decision to open Guantanamo in the first place.  (Applause.) Now let me be blunt.  There are no neat or easy answers here.  I wish there were.  But I can tell you that the wrong answer is to pretend like this problem will go away if we maintain an unsustainable status quo.  As President, I refuse to allow this problem to fester.  I refuse to pass it on to somebody else.  It is my responsibility to solve the problem.  Our security interests will not permit us to delay.  Our courts won't allow it.  And neither should our conscience. Now, over the last several weeks, we've seen a return of the politicization of these issues that have characterized the last several years.  I'm an elected official; I understand these problems arouse passions and concerns.  They should.  We're confronting some of the most complicated questions that a democracy can face.  But I have no interest in spending all of our time relitigating the policies of the last eight years.  I'll leave that to others.  I want to solve these problems, and I want to solve them together as Americans. And we will be ill-served by some of the fear-mongering that emerges whenever we discuss this issue.  Listening to the recent debate, I've heard words that, frankly, are calculated to scare people rather than educate them; words that have more to do with politics than protecting our country.  So I want to take this opportunity to lay out what we are doing, and how we intend to resolve these outstanding issues.  I will explain how each action that we are taking will help build a framework that protects both the American people and the values that we hold most dear.  And I'll focus on two broad areas:  first, issues relating to Guantanamo and our detention policy; but, second, I also want to discuss issues relating to security and transparency. Now, let me begin by disposing of one argument as plainly as I can:  We are not going to release anyone if it would endanger our national security, nor will we release detainees within the United States who endanger the American people.  Where demanded by justice and national security, we will seek to transfer some detainees to the same type of facilities in which we hold all manner of dangerous and violent criminals within our borders -- namely, highly secure prisons that ensure the public safety. As we make these decisions, bear in mind the following fact:  Nobody has ever escaped from one of our federal, supermax prisons, which hold hundreds of convicted terrorists.  As Republican Lindsey Graham said, the idea that we cannot find a place to securely house 250-plus detainees within the United States is not rational. We are currently in the process of reviewing each of the detainee cases at Guantanamo to determine the appropriate policy for dealing with them.  And as we do so, we are acutely aware that under the last administration, detainees were released and, in some cases, returned to the battlefield.  That's why we are doing away with the poorly planned, haphazard approach that let those detainees go in the past.  Instead we are treating these cases with the care and attention that the law requires and that our security demands. Now, going forward, these cases will fall into five distinct categories. First, whenever feasible, we will try those who have violated American criminal laws in federal courts -- courts provided for by the United States Constitution.  Some have derided our federal courts as incapable of handling the trials of terrorists.  They are wrong.  Our courts and our juries, our citizens, are tough enough to convict terrorists.  The record makes that clear.  Ramzi Yousef tried to blow up the World Trade Center.  He was convicted in our courts and is serving a life sentence in U.S. prisons.  Zacarias Moussaoui has been identified as the 20th 9/11 hijacker.  He was convicted in our courts, and he too is serving a life sentence in prison.  If we can try those terrorists in our courts and hold them in our prisons, then we can do the same with detainees from Guantanamo. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Recently, we prosecuted and received a guilty plea from a detainee, al-Marri, in federal court after years of legal confusion.  We're preparing to transfer another detainee to the Southern District Court of New York, where he will face trial on charges related to the 1998 bombings of our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania -- bombings that killed over 200 people.  Preventing this detainee from coming to our shores would prevent his trial and conviction.  And after over a decade, it is time to finally see that justice is served, and that is what we intend to do.  (Applause.) Advertisement The second category of cases involves detainees who violate the laws of war and are therefore best tried through military commissions.  Military commissions have a history in the United States dating back to George Washington and the Revolutionary War.  They are an appropriate venue for trying detainees for violations of the laws of war.  They allow for the protection of sensitive sources and methods of intelligence-gathering; they allow for the safety and security of participants; and for the presentation of evidence gathered from the battlefield that cannot always be effectively presented in federal courts. Now, some have suggested that this represents a reversal on my part.  They should look at the record.  In 2006, I did strongly oppose legislation proposed by the Bush administration and passed by the Congress because it failed to establish a legitimate legal framework, with the kind of meaningful due process rights for the accused that could stand up on appeal. I said at that time, however, that I supported the use of military commissions to try detainees, provided there were several reforms, and in fact there were some bipartisan efforts to achieve those reforms.  Those are the reforms that we are now making.  Instead of using the flawed commissions of the last seven years, my administration is bringing our commissions in line with the rule of law.  We will no longer permit the use of evidence -- as evidence statements that have been obtained using cruel, inhuman, or degrading interrogation methods.  We will no longer place the burden to prove that hearsay is unreliable on the opponent of the hearsay.  And we will give detainees greater latitude in selecting their own counsel, and more protections if they refuse to testify.  These reforms, among others, will make our military commissions a more credible and effective means of administering justice, and I will work with Congress and members of both parties, as well as legal authorities across the political spectrum, on legislation to ensure that these commissions are fair, legitimate, and effective. The third category of detainees includes those who have been ordered released by the courts.  Now, let me repeat what I said earlier:  This has nothing to do with my decision to close Guantanamo.  It has to do with the rule of law.  The courts have spoken.  They have found that there's no legitimate reason to hold 21 of the people currently held at Guantanamo.  Nineteen of these findings took place before I was sworn into office.  I cannot ignore these rulings because as President, I too am bound by the law.  The United States is a nation of laws and so we must abide by these rulings. The fourth category of cases involves detainees who we have determined can be transferred safely to another country.  So far, our review team has approved 50 detainees for transfer.  And my administration is in ongoing discussions with a number of other countries about the transfer of detainees to their soil for detention and rehabilitation. Now, finally, there remains the question of detainees at Guantanamo who cannot be prosecuted yet who pose a clear danger to the American people.  And I have to be honest here -- this is the toughest single issue that we will face.  We're going to exhaust every avenue that we have to prosecute those at Guantanamo who pose a danger to our country.  But even when this process is complete, there may be a number of people who cannot be prosecuted for past crimes, in some cases because evidence may be tainted, but who nonetheless pose a threat to the security of the United States.  Examples of that threat include people who've received extensive explosives training at al Qaeda training camps, or commanded Taliban troops in battle, or expressed their allegiance to Osama bin Laden, or otherwise made it clear that they want to kill Americans.  These are people who, in effect, remain at war with the United States. Let me repeat:  I am not going to release individuals who endanger the American people.  Al Qaeda terrorists and their affiliates are at war with the United States, and those that we capture -- like other prisoners of war -- must be prevented from attacking us again.  Having said that, we must recognize that these detention policies cannot be unbounded.  They can't be based simply on what I or the executive branch decide alone.  That's why my administration has begun to reshape the standards that apply to ensure that they are in line with the rule of law. We must have clear, defensible, and lawful standards for those who fall into this category.  We must have fair procedures so that we don't make mistakes.  We must have a thorough process of periodic review, so that any prolonged detention is carefully evaluated and justified. I know that creating such a system poses unique challenges. And other countries have grappled with this question; now, so must we.  But I want to be very clear that our goal is to construct a legitimate legal framework for the remaining Guantanamo detainees that cannot be transferred.  Our goal is not to avoid a legitimate legal framework.  In our constitutional system, prolonged detention should not be the decision of any one man.  If and when we determine that the United States must hold individuals to keep them from carrying out an act of war, we will do so within a system that involves judicial and congressional oversight.  And so, going forward, my administration will work with Congress to develop an appropriate legal regime so that our efforts are consistent with our values and our Constitution. Advertisement Now, as our efforts to close Guantanamo move forward, I know that the politics in Congress will be difficult.  These are issues that are fodder for 30-second commercials.  You can almost picture the direct mail pieces that emerge from any vote on this issue -- designed to frighten the population.  I get it.  But if we continue to make decisions within a climate of fear, we will make more mistakes.  And if we refuse to deal with these issues today, then I guarantee you that they will be an albatross around our efforts to combat terrorism in the future. I have confidence that the American people are more interested in doing what is right to protect this country than in political posturing.  I am not the only person in this city who swore an oath to uphold the Constitution -- so did each and every member of Congress.  And together we have a responsibility to enlist our values in the effort to secure our people, and to leave behind the legacy that makes it easier for future Presidents to keep this country safe. Now, let me touch on a second set of issues that relate to security and transparency. National security requires a delicate balance.  One the one hand, our democracy depends on transparency.  On the other hand, some information must be protected from public disclosure for the sake of our security -- for instance, the movement of our troops, our intelligence-gathering, or the information we have about a terrorist organization and its affiliates.  In these and other cases, lives are at stake. Now, several weeks ago, as part of an ongoing court case, I released memos issued by the previous administration's Office of Legal Counsel.  I did not do this because I disagreed with the enhanced interrogation techniques that those memos authorized, and I didn't release the documents because I rejected their legal rationales -- although I do on both counts.  I released the memos because the existence of that approach to interrogation was already widely known, the Bush administration had acknowledged its existence, and I had already banned those methods.  The argument that somehow by releasing those memos we are providing terrorists with information about how they will be interrogated makes no sense.  We will not be interrogating terrorists using that approach.  That approach is now prohibited. In short, I released these memos because there was no overriding reason to protect them.  And the ensuing debate has helped the American people better understand how these interrogation methods came to be authorized and used. On the other hand, I recently opposed the release of certain photographs that were taken of detainees by U.S. personnel between 2002 and 2004.  Individuals who violated standards of behavior in these photos have been investigated and they have been held accountable.  There was and is no debate as to whether what is reflected in those photos is wrong.  Nothing has been concealed to absolve perpetrators of crimes.  However, it was my judgment -- informed by my national security team -- that releasing these photos would inflame anti-American opinion and allow our enemies to paint U.S. troops with a broad, damning, and inaccurate brush, thereby endangering them in theaters of war. In short, there is a clear and compelling reason to not release these particular photos.  There are nearly 200,000 Americans who are serving in harm's way, and I have a solemn responsibility for their safety as Commander-in-Chief.  Nothing would be gained by the release of these photos that matters more than the lives of our young men and women serving in harm's way. Now, in the press's mind and in some of the public's mind, these two cases are contradictory.  They are not to me.  In each of these cases, I had to strike the right balance between transparency and national security.  And this balance brings with it a precious responsibility.  There's no doubt that the American people have seen this balance tested over the last several years.  In the images from Abu Ghraib and the brutal interrogation techniques made public long before I was President, the American people learned of actions taken in their name that bear no resemblance to the ideals that generations of Americans have fought for.  And whether it was the run-up to the Iraq war or the revelation of secret programs, Americans often felt like part of the story had been unnecessarily withheld from them.  And that caused suspicion to build up.  And that leads to a thirst for accountability. Advertisement I understand that.  I ran for President promising transparency, and I meant what I said.  And that's why, whenever possible, my administration will make all information available to the American people so that they can make informed judgments and hold us accountable.  But I have never argued -- and I never will -- that our most sensitive national security matters should simply be an open book.  I will never abandon -- and will vigorously defend -- the necessity of classification to defend our troops at war, to protect sources and methods, and to safeguard confidential actions that keep the American people safe.  Here's the difference though:  Whenever we cannot release certain information to the public for valid national security reasons, I will insist that there is oversight of my actions -- by Congress or by the courts. We're currently launching a review of current policies by all those agencies responsible for the classification of documents to determine where reforms are possible, and to assure that the other branches of government will be in a position to review executive branch decisions on these matters.  Because in our system of checks and balances, someone must always watch over the watchers -- especially when it comes to sensitive administration -- information. Now, along these same lines, my administration is also confronting challenges to what is known as the "state secrets" privilege.  This is a doctrine that allows the government to challenge legal cases involving secret programs.  It's been used by many past Presidents -- Republican and Democrat -- for many decades.  And while this principle is absolutely necessary in some circumstances to protect national security, I am concerned that it has been over-used.  It is also currently the subject of a wide range of lawsuits.  So let me lay out some principles here.  We must not protect information merely because it reveals the violation of a law or embarrassment to the government.  And that's why my administration is nearing completion of a thorough review of this practice. And we plan to embrace several principles for reform.  We will apply a stricter legal test to material that can be protected under the state secrets privilege.  We will not assert the privilege in court without first following our own formal process, including review by a Justice Department committee and the personal approval of the Attorney General.  And each year we will voluntarily report to Congress when we have invoked the privilege and why because, as I said before, there must be proper oversight over our actions. On all these matters related to the disclosure of sensitive information, I wish I could say that there was some simple formula out there to be had.  There is not.  These often involve tough calls, involve competing concerns, and they require a surgical approach.  But the common thread that runs through all of my decisions is simple:  We will safeguard what we must to protect the American people, but we will also ensure the accountability and oversight that is the hallmark of our constitutional system.  I will never hide the truth because it's uncomfortable.  I will deal with Congress and the courts as co-equal branches of government.  I will tell the American people what I know and don't know, and when I release something publicly or keep something secret, I will tell you why.  (Applause.) Now, in all the areas that I've discussed today, the policies that I've proposed represent a new direction from the last eight years.  To protect the American people and our values, we've banned enhanced interrogation techniques.  We are closing the prison at Guantanamo.  We are reforming military commissions, and we will pursue a new legal regime to detain terrorists.  We are declassifying more information and embracing more oversight of our actions, and we're narrowing our use of the state secrets privilege.  These are dramatic changes that will put our approach to national security on a surer, safer, and more sustainable footing.  Their implementation will take time, but they will get done. There's a core principle that we will apply to all of our actions.  Even as we clean up the mess at Guantanamo, we will constantly reevaluate our approach, subject our decisions to review from other branches of government, as well as the public.  We seek the strongest and most sustainable legal framework for addressing these issues in the long term -- not to serve immediate politics, but to do what's right over the long term.  By doing that we can leave behind a legacy that outlasts my administration, my presidency, that endures for the next President and the President after that -- a legacy that protects the American people and enjoys a broad legitimacy at home and abroad. Now, this is what I mean when I say that we need to focus on the future.  I recognize that many still have a strong desire to focus on the past.  When it comes to actions of the last eight years, passions are high.  Some Americans are angry; others want to re-fight debates that have been settled, in some cases debates that they have lost.  I know that these debates lead directly, in some cases, to a call for a fuller accounting, perhaps through an independent commission. Advertisement I've opposed the creation of such a commission because I believe that our existing democratic institutions are strong enough to deliver accountability.  The Congress can review abuses of our values, and there are ongoing inquiries by the Congress into matters like enhanced interrogation techniques.  The Department of Justice and our courts can work through and punish any violations of our laws or miscarriages of justice. It's no secret there is a tendency in Washington to spend our time pointing fingers at one another.  And it's no secret that our media culture feeds the impulse that lead to a good fight and good copy.  But nothing will contribute more than that than a extended relitigation of the last eight years.  Already, we've seen how that kind of effort only leads those in Washington to different sides to laying blame.  It can distract us from focusing our time, our efforts, and our politics on the challenges of the future. We see that, above all, in the recent debate -- how the recent debate has obscured the truth and sends people into opposite and absolutist ends.  On the one side of the spectrum, there are those who make little allowance for the unique challenges posed by terrorism, and would almost never put national security over transparency.  And on the other end of the spectrum, there are those who embrace a view that can be summarized in two words:  "Anything goes."  Their arguments suggest that the ends of fighting terrorism can be used to justify any means, and that the President should have blanket authority to do whatever he wants -- provided it is a President with whom they agree. Both sides may be sincere in their views, but neither side is right.  The American people are not absolutist, and they don't elect us to impose a rigid ideology on our problems.  They know that we need not sacrifice our security for our values, nor sacrifice our values for our security, so long as we approach difficult questions with honesty and care and a dose of common sense.  That, after all, is the unique genius of America.  That's the challenge laid down by our Constitution.  That has been the source of our strength through the ages.  That's what makes the United States of America different as a nation. I can stand here today, as President of the United States, and say without exception or equivocation that we do not torture, and that we will vigorously protect our people while forging a strong and durable framework that allows us to fight terrorism while abiding by the rule of law.  Make no mistake:  If we fail to turn the page on the approach that was taken over the past several years, then I will not be able to say that as President.  And if we cannot stand for our core values, then we are not keeping faith with the documents that are enshrined in this hall.  (Applause.) The Framers who drafted the Constitution could not have foreseen the challenges that have unfolded over the last 222 years.  But our Constitution has endured through secession and civil rights, through World War and Cold War, because it provides a foundation of principles that can be applied pragmatically; it provides a compass that can help us find our way.  It hasn't always been easy.  We are an imperfect people.  Every now and then, there are those who think that America's safety and success requires us to walk away from the sacred principles enshrined in this building.  And we hear such voices today.  But over the long haul the American people have resisted that temptation.  And though we've made our share of mistakes, required some course corrections, ultimately we have held fast to the principles that have been the source of our strength and a beacon to the world. Now this generation faces a great test in the specter of terrorism.  And unlike the Civil War or World War II, we can't count on a surrender ceremony to bring this journey to an end.  Right now, in distant training camps and in crowded cities, there are people plotting to take American lives.  That will be the case a year from now, five years from now, and -- in all probability -- 10 years from now.  Neither I nor anyone can stand here today and say that there will not be another terrorist attack that takes American lives.  But I can say with certainty that my administration -- along with our extraordinary troops and the patriotic men and women who defend our national security -- will do everything in our power to keep the American people safe.  And I do know with certainty that we can defeat al Qaeda.  Because the terrorists can only succeed if they swell their ranks and alienate America from our allies, and they will never be able to do that if we stay true to who we are, if we forge tough and durable approaches to fighting terrorism that are anchored in our timeless ideals.  This must be our common purpose. I ran for President because I believe that we cannot solve the challenges of our time unless we solve them together.  We will not be safe if we see national security as a wedge that divides America -- it can and must be a cause that unites us as one people and as one nation.  We've done so before in times that were more perilous than ours.  We will do so once again. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.  (Applause.) We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think."
"Israeli Planes Batter Lebanon Again, Killing 30 People","Advertisement By JAD MOUAWAD and STEVEN ERLANGER JULY 18, 2006  BEIRUT, Lebanon , July 18 —  Israeli warplanes continued to batter targets in Lebanon today,  killing 30 people, including 11 members of the Lebanese Army when bombs hit their barracks east of Beirut. Four of the dead were officers, and 30 more soldiers were wounded. Israel , which is trying to destroy the military capacity of the Hezbollah militia and secure the release of two captured soldiers, said that it was aiming at   only Hezbollah and not the Lebanese Army, although on Monday, a Lebanese Army position was shelled in Tripoli and eight soldiers died. In southern Lebanon, nine members of a single family were killed and four wounded in an Israeli airstrike on their house in the village of Aitaroun, near the Israeli border. According to the United Nations, about 500,000 Lebanese are thought to have left their homes in southern Beirut and southern Lebanon to escape the violence. The Lebanese prime minister, Fouad Siniora, criticized the world for not stopping the Israeli offensive. “The international community is not doing all that is can in order to stop Israel continuing its aggression against Lebanon,” Mr. Siniora said in an interview in his Beirut office. “They are stopping short of exercising the necessary pressure on Israel while Israel is taking this as a green light.” Advertisement He also accused Israel of “committing massacres against Lebanese civilians and working to destroy everything that allows Lebanon to stay alive.” Advertisement On the seventh day of this conflict, Hezbollah rockets again hit Israel’s port city of Haifa and also Nahariya, a coastal town just south of the border, where one man died and several were wounded, one critically. Hundreds of thousands of Israelis continued to spend their time in shelters, and Haifa was largely shut down, with only grocery stores and pharmacies open. About 150 rockets were fired, the Israeli Army said. As the bombs and rockets fell, diplomats and officials continued to debate the effectiveness of any new international force that could patrol the border and help Lebanon implement United Nations Security Council resolutions that call for the Hezbollah militia to be disarmed and for the Lebanese government to extend its authority over the whole country. A team sent by the United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, met in Jerusalem today with senior Israeli officials, including the foreign minister, Tzippi Livni, and top aides to Prime Minister Ehud Olmert. Mr. Olmert dropped in at the end of their meeting to explain the Israeli position, Israeli officials said, underlining his skepticism about how any new force might work. Mr. Olmert, in a televised speech to parliament on Monday night, said  Israel would continue fighting until its soldiers were free, the Lebanese Army was deployed along the border, and Hezbollah was effectively disarmed in line with Security Council Resolution 1559. Hezbollah has consistently rejected those terms. A top Israeli general said today that Israel’s offensive in Lebanon would last another few weeks, and he said  the use of large numbers of ground forces had not been ruled out. Maj. Gen. Moshe Kaplinsky, Israel’s deputy chief of staff, told Israel Radio that the army needed more time to complete “very clear goals.” He added: “The fighting in Lebanon will end within a few weeks. We will not take months.” On Monday, General Kaplinsky told a reporter that Israel thought it would have another week before international pressure built up enough to work out an enforceable cease-fire. In the last seven days, the Israeli Army said, it has carried out about 2,000 sorties of warplanes and attack helicopters and hit more than 1,000 targets in Lebanon, including about 200 rocket launchers and sites. Advertisement The army said today that it had struck four civilian trucks carrying weaponry, believed to be rockets, into Lebanon on the Damascus-Beirut highway. “They were under the guise of civilian trucks,” said Capt. Jacob Dallal, an army spokesman. “But in each case we could see secondary explosions.” Each Israeli target is approved in advance as “Hezbollah or directly or indirectly helping Hezbollah to fire rockets at Israel,” Captain Dallal said. The Lebanese Army was not a target for Israel, he said. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has been asked by President Bush to travel to the Middle East,  but her trip is not believed to be scheduled until sometime next week, making any halt to the fighting unlikely until then. The European Union’s foreign policy chief, Javier Solana, is due in Jerusalem on Wednesday. After meeting the United Nations envoys, Ms. Livni said that Israel would insist that any settlement include provisions to ensure that Iran and Syria cannot rearm Hezbollah, presumably through some form of international monitoring at the Syrian border and the Beirut airport. Israel has bombed both routes to prevent any rearming  for now and has put a sea blockade on Lebanese ports. Ms. Livni  said  any settlement must “end the Iranian and Syrian control over Lebanese and Israeli lives” and repeated Israel’s demand that its three captured soldiers —  two by Hezbollah and one by Hamas and other militants in Gaza —  be released “immediately and without conditions.” A United Nations envoy, Terje Roed-Larsen, said his team  had had “good intensive productive talks” with the Israelis about “specific and concrete ideas” presented by the United Nations. “Both parties agree it is necessary to have a political framework to reach a cease-fire.” Mr. Annan, the United Nations secretary general, said in Brussels today that any force must have a different set of instructions from the current, toothless United Nations peacekeeping force,  which is still in the southern Lebanon. “It is urgent that the international community acts to make a difference on the ground,” Mr. Annan said. Giora Eiland, until recently Israel’s national security adviser, said an international force would not be  in Israel’s interest if it only acted as a buffer. It can only be effective, he said, “if the other side does not want any provocation and wants to maintain quiet” and “if there’s a credible address on the other side,” with control over Lebanon. Advertisement He said Israel should  insist that any international force “make it possible for Lebanon to do what it has to do and not be a buffer between us and them, which would reduce the Lebanese government’s responsibility.” On a visit to Haifa, to a house struck the day before, the former Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, now in opposition, compared the current conflict to the Cuban missile crisis in 1962. When Soviet missiles were aimed at the United States, he said, “President Kennedy had one policy: Remove the threat, remove the missiles. That should be our policy, and I believe it is, and we support it wholeheartedly.” Iran, which set up Hezbollah in 1982 to fight Israel, has said that it will not accept the disarming and dismantling of the militant group.  A senior Iranian politician, Gholam Ali Hadad-Adel, who is the president of the Iranian Parliament, told a rally in Tehran that Israelis should “flee occupied Palestine.” He called Israel “this filthy tumor” that “lies in the body of the Islamic world,” and he warned the United States that so long as Israel exists, “Muslims will not stop hating America.” Among the  attacks  in Lebanon today, a convoy of medical goods donated by the United Arab Emirates was hit in the Bekaa valley near Zahle, a mostly Christian town on one of the few open roads linking Syria and Beirut. Two trucks were destroyed and their drivers killed. Near Hamra, Lebanon, Samer Jundi, 27, said he had lost a relative in a raid on village in the south. “He was an innocent man who minds his own business,” Mr. Jundi said. “He never harmed anyone and was never involved in politics and yet Israel killed him. And it seems that many more as innocent as he was will die as our government and the whole world watches passively.” Dalia Harati, 33, a Sunni Arab, said: “It is really sad and heartbreaking to see how many Lebanese died so far and how this country is being destroyed bit by bit. All what was rebuilt during these years is gone now. And this process will have to start all over again. I think that it’s more than any country can bear, let alone a nation as divided and weak as ours.” The evacuation of foreigners continued for a second day today after a ferry chartered by the French government reached Cyprus with a first batch of more than 1,200 people. The American Embassy began airlifting its citizens by helicopter, with some 320 Americans scheduled to leave by the end of the day and another 1,000 on Wednesday. About 8,000 Americans are registered with the embassy, but there are an estimated 25,000 Americans or dual-nationals living in Lebanon. Britain sent six ships to the region. Mr. Siniora, the Lebanese  prime  minister, said in today’s interview that he favored a release of the two Israeli soldiers. But he coupled that call with other requirements. Any solution to the crisis, he said, should include Israel’s withdrawal from the disputed Shebaa farms area of the border, the release of Lebanese detainees in Israeli jails and a return to the terms of the 1949 armistice between the two countries. Advertisement He suggested that the Lebanese Army would move to Southern Lebanon once these conditions were met. He backed the idea of a more robust international force, but only after “all the issues” were put on the table, and he stopped short of condemning Hezbollah for inviting the Israeli attacks on the rest of the country. “I am not pardoning the act of abducting the two soldier,” Mr. Siniora said. “No, they have to be handed over. The same thing, they have to hand over the detainees in the Israeli prisons.” Beirut settled to its first week of violence and conflict. Many shops, banks and stores opened for a few hours this  morning, but closed much earlier than usual. The city streets were calm, with little traffic. In the newly rebuilt city center, where usually thousands of tourists, and Lebanese, gather at the end of the day to smoke a water pipe, meet for a drink before diner, or take the children for a walk, there were only private security guards and soldiers. Beirut’s luxury stores, famous throughout the region, were shut. We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think."
"Donald Trump considering 'brand new' immigration order","President says he will win legal battle over travel ban as confusion reigns over whether he will appeal to supreme court  David Smith and  Ben Jacobs in Washington  Sat 11 Feb 2017 12.11 GMT   First published on Fri 10 Feb 2017 19.55 GMT   Donald Trump has said he is considering signing a “brand-new” executive order on immigration, following the court ruling blocking his travel ban on Thursday. The US president said he was confident he would win the court battle over the hugely controversial executive order suspending the country’s refugee programme and barring citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries, and which is currently blocked. He said the White House was also considering “a lot of other options, including just filing a brand new order”. Asked if he meant a new executive order, he said: “It very well could be. We need speed for reasons of security, so it very well could be.” Speaking onboard Air Force One on his way to Florida for the weekend, Trump said he could sign a fresh executive order as soon as Monday or Tuesday. Asked what revisions the new order would include, he said: “New security measures.” He said a new order would probably change “very little” from the first, according to the Associated Press. There was confusion about whether the administration intended to take the fight to the supreme court, following his setback in a San Francisco federal court on Thursday. Despite the president claiming he would “win that [legal] battle” over the travel ban, a White House official told Reuters the president had decided not to go to the supreme court. “The temporary restraining order, we would not take to the supreme court, but we are reviewing all options in the court system,” the official was quoted as saying. Minutes later the Washington Post quoted White House chief of staff Reince Priebus as saying the administration was “reviewing all of our options in the court system” – including the supreme court. The ruling by the ninth US circuit court of appeals in San Francisco on Thursday applies only to the question of whether district judge James Robart in Seattle was correct in issuing a temporary restraining order against the travel ban. Trump could choose to sidestep this fight and concentrate on the legal proceedings over whether the travel ban is constitutional, which will continue in Robart’s court over the next weeks. Separately, an unidentified judge on the ninth circuit on Friday requested that the court consider reconsidering the travel ban case “en banc” – or by a full panel of 11 judges. The court’s 25 judges will vote on the issue after both sides file briefs, which are due on 16 February. Earlier, Trump had said he would make a fresh policy announcement next week in response to the ruling, but he gave few details about his next move in a tussle with the judiciary that has stymied one of his first and most controversial measures. “We’ll be doing something very rapidly having to do with additional security for our country,” Trump told a joint press conference with the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe. “You’ll see something next week.” Trump suffered a setback on Thursday when a US appeals court refused to reinstate the temporary travel ban. Trump responded swiftly on Twitter with a message in capitals that said: “SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!” Speaking at the White House, the president insisted: “We are going to keep our country safe, we are going to do whatever is necessary to keep our country safe. We had a decision which we think we are going to be very successful with, it shouldn’t take too much time ... Ultimately I have no doubt we’ll win that particular case.” He added: “There are tremendous threats to our country. We will not allow that to happen. We will continue to do things to make our country safe. We will not allow people into our country who are looking to do harm to our people.” Trump’s order barred people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from entering the US for 90 days and barred all refugees for 120 days. Refugees from Syria were banned indefinitely. It triggered disarray at airports and widespread protests. Trump’s defeated election opponent, Hillary Clinton, also responded to the court ruling , with a tweet that read: “3-0” – presumably a reference either to the three judges’ unanimous verdict or three consecutive rulings against the ban. Democrats welcomed the verdict as a triumph for America’s democratic checks and balances. Joe Crowley, leader of the House Democratic caucus, said: “This is a major, major, major defeat for the administration. And I think there will be more, because they will continue to overstep.” Addressing Trump’s angry tweet, Crowley said: “The president needs to grow up.” The president seems likely to take the battle all the way to the supreme court but he is also fending off more than a dozen additional lawsuits now moving through the courts. Lawyers for the state of Virginia are mounting one of the challenges, arguing that the ban violates the constitution and results from “animus toward Muslims”. Michael Kelly, a spokesman for the Virginia attorney general, Mark Herring, said Friday’s hearing in a federal court posed the most significant state challenge yet to Trump’s order. In a statement, he said it “will be the most in-depth examination of the merits of the arguments against the ban”. The district court in Washington state – the court where the temporary restraining order was issued – will continue to consider the original complaint of irreparable harm brought by the attorney general. The process, which could take months, could result in a ruling “on the merits” of the ban, which would involve a detailed legal evaluation of the constitutional and statutory arguments. Abe was the only world leader to meet Trump before his inauguration and is the second, after Theresa May, to do so since the president took office. The meeting was seen as an opportunity to shore up US-Japanese relations after Trump withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a flagship trade deal created by Barack Obama. I grabbed him and hugged him because that’s the way we feel. We have a very good chemistry Abe said: “On TPP, of course we are fully aware of President Trump’s decision. On economic issues, we will be discussing at the working lunch to follow. As for Japan and the United States, trade and investment as well as economic relations, how can we develop and grow our relationship?” The prime minister said “a new framework for dialogue” was already being developed. “And I am quite optimistic that the good results will be seen from the dialogue. Now, to make sure it is a free and fair common set of rules to be created for the free trade regime in the region, and that was the purpose of TPP, and that importance has not changed.” Both leaders were keen to stress their warm relationship. “I grabbed him and hugged him because that’s the way we feel,” Trump said. “We have a very good bond, a very good chemistry.” Meeting in the Oval Office, Trump reportedly told the Japanese prime minister: “You have a strong handshake.” Then, at a press conference in the east room, Trump welcomed Abe to the “very famous White House”. He promised joint co-operation, including “against the North Korean missile and nuclear threat, both of which I consider a very, very high priority”, and on a free and fair trade relationship. Abe, on a charm offensive, refrained from criticising Trump over the TPP. He hailed the US as a “champion of democracy” and Trump as “an excellent businessman” who had learned political skills during last year’s election campaign. Although he nodded along and seemed to be listening intently, Trump was not wearing a translation earpiece during Abe’s remarks. Asked if Trump had worn an earpiece, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House deputy press secretary, said: “I don’t believe during that time. But he did see the text and they spoke quite extensively before the remarks.” Trump did put a small speaker to his right ear during the question and answer session. On Saturday, Trump will host Abe and his wife at his Mar-a-Lago Club in Florida. The two leaders are scheduled to play golf on Saturday. A White House official said Trump was paying for Abe and his wife to travel to Mar-a-Lago as a “gift” – sidestepping ethical concerns that his properties might profit from a foreign visitor. Abe said modestly: “My score in golf is not up to the level of Donald at all.” At the press conference, Trump took only two questions from western media outlets: the New York Post and Fox Business Network, both owned by Rupert Murdoch, who has been supportive of his campaign and administration. There was no opportunity during the short question-and-answer session for reporters from other organisations to ask about the controversies swirling around Trump’s aides Kellyanne Conway and Michael Flynn . While Conway, who is counsellor to the president, was rebuked by the White House on Thursday after she appeared on television urging the public to buy the branded products of the president’s daughter Ivanka, the allegations against Trump’s national security adviser, Michael Flynn, are potentially far more serious. Reports claim that Flynn had discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador to Washington before taking office, contrary to his earlier adamant denials. The report in the Washington Post contradicted Flynn’s assertion on Wednesday that he never discussed the topic with Sergey Kislyak during a series of phone calls in December, while Obama was still president. On Friday, Flynn’s staff at the national security council said he could no longer be sure whether sanctions had been discussed. Democrat Adam Schiff, ranking member of the House permanent select committee on intelligence, said: “The allegation that General Flynn, while President Obama was still in office, secretly discussed with Russia’s ambassador ways to undermine the sanctions levied against Russia for its interference in the Presidential election on Donald Trump’s behalf, raises serious questions of legality and fitness for office. “If he did so, and then he and other administration officials misled the American people, his conduct would be all the more pernicious, and he should no longer serve in this administration or any other.” Late on Thursday, Trump reaffirmed Washington’s longstanding “one China” policy in a call with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. The move looked set to ease tensions with China after earlier concerns that Trump might use Taiwan – a democratically ruled island that Beijing considers a breakaway province – as leverage in negotiations over trade, security and other issues. At his White House press conference, Trump said of the call with Xi: “It was a very warm conversation. I think we are on the process of getting along very well. That will also be of benefit to Japan. We discussed a lot of subjects. It was a long talk.” The president’s cabinet picks also continue to face resistance. Protesters blocked the new education secretary, Betsy DeVos, when she tried to enter a school in Washington on Friday morning. One demonstrator stood in front of the stairway entrance, prompting DeVos to walk back to her vehicle, though she eventually entered the building. The Senate voted along party lines early on Friday to confirm Tom Price , a conservative Georgia congressman and harsh critic of Obama’s healthcare reform, as health secretary. Trump had vowed to repeal and replace “Obamacare” immediately but has since conceded that the process is complicated and may take time. The Democratic senator Chris Murphy, of Connecticut, speaking at a Washington Post forum, said that on inauguration day, he felt the odds were 80-20 that the Affordable Care Act would get repealed. “Now I’m not sure it’s even 50-50.” Democrats were willing to work with Republicans on various fixes and improvements, he added.

"","Korwin-Mikke, the far-right Polish leader whose deal gave Ukip more power in Brussels, reveals his views on Hitler and rape  Sat 8 Nov 2014 19.48 GMT   Last modified on Sat 2 Dec 2017 06.31 GMT   Dapper in bow tie and blazer, Nigel Farage’s new European ally likes to welcome a woman to his grey-walled, grey-carpeted Brussels office by stooping to kiss her hand. There is a danger, though, that he will follow up this display of old-fashioned courtesy by sharing some old-fashioned views about her inferiority. Janusz Korwin-Mikke is the eccentric head of Poland’s Congress of the New Right. With his agreement, a member of the party, Robert Iwaszkiewicz, has just joined Ukip’s parliamentary alliance , Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy (EFDD), pushing it over a threshold of 25 parliamentarians from seven countries and thus securing more than £1m in funding for Ukip alone. A friend in need is a friend indeed. But Korwin-Mikke has the potential to be an embarrassing ally. For instance, he thinks women’s opinions are shaped by the sperm of the men they sleep with, that they are “on average” less clever than men, and that nearly half of women who tell a man they don’t want to have sex with them are feigning reluctance and should be ignored. “Semen probably is not wasted, because nature usually makes use of the material it has, and there is a hypothesis that the attitudes of men are passed to women by way of the semen which penetrates the tissue,” he told the Observer , in the tone a science teacher might use for a basic lesson. Giggles only prompt an admonition. “It is not a political statement. There is a very strong argument for this hypothesis, that now when contraceptives are much more in use, the women become much more independent.” Korwin-Mikke, 72, is an extreme libertarian. A veteran with half a century’s political experience, he throws out his bizarre views in rapid-fire sentences, broken by the easy smile of a man used to deference, which only makes them seem more disturbing. There is no proof Hitler knew about the Holocaust, he has argued for years, and he told the Observer that Mussolini, who stripped Jewish citizens of property and civil rights, then sent thousands to German concentration camps, “was trying to protect Jews”. He would like to abolish not just the European Union but democracy altogether, replacing it with an absolute monarchy, which he considers the gold standard for government. His main objection to dictatorship is that it leaves open the question of who succeeds a leader. He hungers for what he says is a lost Europe of dog-eat-dog economic rules, the freedom to buy arsenic over the counter by the kilo, drive without seatbelts and give free rein to the aggression that he says made the continent great. “If someone gives money to an unemployed person he should have his hand cut off because he is destroying the morale of the people,” Korwin-Mikke said, adding that the state should not give anyone a cent either. “Europeans were very aggressive and now the boys are taught not to be aggressive … Give them the pistol, give them a sword.” Apparently practising what he preaches, this summer he slapped a leftwing Polish politician in the face. Shortly before the attack, France’s far-right Front National, led by Marine Le Pen, decided he was too extreme for an alliance. But now Korwin-Mikke’s party has come to the rescue of Ukip’s parliamentary alliance. After a defection by a Latvian parliamentarian jeopardised access to speaking time in parliament and millions of euros in EU cash, Iwaszkiewicz joined the group, ensuring it held on to its funding. An EFDD spokesman said the Pole was invited and joined as an individual, and there was “no deal with any political party”, but both Iwaszkiewicz and his leader presented the move as a party decision, to the Observer and voters at home. “That is the only group which is organised and Eurosceptic in the parliament,” Iwaszkiewicz, a businessman-turned-politician, said in an interview in the corridors of parliament, as his aides scowled at Eurocrats tucking into a free buffet lunch. “That is why we wanted – not only me but all four MEPs of the Congress of the New Right – to help the EFDD to stay alive.” Korwin-Mikke was gleeful about striking a deal with Ukip, although evasive about specifics, saying only that it might lead to more alliances in future. “If we create our own group, perhaps Mr Farage can lend us a member of his party also.” Polish academic and anti-racism campaigner Rafal Pankowski dismissed the distinction between Iwaszkiewicz and his party as a false one. The MEP rode into parliament on the back of Korwin-Mikke’s outsize personality, and although he may take a slightly more moderate public stance, has never attempted to distance himself from his leader’s views. “I have never found any indication of any kind of policy difference between them … on the contrary, he has often defended [Korwin-Mikke’s views] in public,” said Pankowski. “The bottom line is that he wouldn’t have been in the European party without the leader. People voted for the Korwin-Mikke party, hardly anyone knows Robert Iwaszkiewicz.” Rabbi Shneur Odze, chairman of Ukip Friends of Israel and a party candidate for next year’s general election, said Korwin-Mikke was “not our responsibility” because he was not in the EFDD group. Iwaskiewicz’s only comment on Hitler “was that he was an evil man who should have been executed. Hardly a Holocaust denier,” he added. But although Iwaszkiewicz is more circumspect, he has not rushed to repudiate his leader or clarify his own position. “I think many expressions of [Korwin-Mikke] are taken out of context and put in a bad light,” he said. Asked if he believed Hitler knew about the Holocaust, he would only say: “That is how I imagine it.” The Congress of the New Right’s hardline economic views actually make it an uneasy bedfellow for Ukip on immigration issues. Korwin-Mikke wants all borders opened and the welfare state shut down, while Farage wants borders largely shut so at least parts of the welfare state can better serve those inside them. The two parties share a more important goal though, both Polish politicians say. “He wants to destroy the European Union, and even Lucifer or Beelzebub who is against the European Union is our ally, because it is the greatest danger to Europe,” said Korwin-Mikke, who wants to convert part of the EU headquarters into a giant brothel. “The building of the European commission is much better, there are small rooms,” he said, trailing off to glance around his small, dark office with a new, appraising eye. Part of his distaste for modern Europe is driven by the position of women, who he says have replaced “privileges” with “equal rights”, a phrase Korwin-Mikke spat out as if it was an insult. Most want to stay at home to raise families, and can’t be trusted to vote, said the twice-married father of six. They are also, he claims, “less tall, less heavy, less intelligent, on the average”. And he adds: “Women usually vote for the more handsome man.” Asked how German chancellor Angela Merkel had come to power in a country where women vote, he changed the topic to sports teams coached by men. “Women want to be led by men,” he claimed. They particularly like to be led to the bedroom, he added, saying that men should often ignore a partner who said no to sex. “Women usually pretend that they don’t want [sex]. You must be competent enough to differentiate whether she seriously doesn’t want,” he said. “The percentage of women who pretend that they don’t want to have sex, but they do want in fact, is about 30 or 40%.” Asked how a rape trial could be prosecuted if a woman’s words were not accepted as evidence of her intentions, he said men should not be convicted unless there were two witnesses to the crime. “If you don’t have two testimonies, he must be acquitted,” he said. “Or some proof or some visible sign of rape, but if it is only her words and his words, there cannot even be a trial.”"
"The real story behind Shell's climate change rhetoric","In the first of an investigative series into the fossil fuel giants from which we are calling on Gates and Wellcome Trust to divest, we reveal Shell’s pursuit of ever riskier reserves is at odds with its own forecasts for dangerous global warming  Sun 17 May 2015 22.00 BST   Last modified on Wed 14 Feb 2018 18.30 GMT   A man of Ben van Beurden’s power and reputation for blunt speaking is capable of silencing a ballroom packed with his boisterous peers. When the chief executive of Shell rose to address an industry gathering in a London hotel, a respectful hush descended. Van Beurden, 57, rose from a modest background in the Netherlands to the top of a cut-throat, politically fraught sector that rarely finds itself out of the public firing line. The annual black-tie dinner at International Petroleum Week in February, a typical nexus of senior executives and high-ranking government officials, was expecting a frank assessment of its response to its biggest challenge: global warming. Van Beurden did not disappoint . Warning the room that the industry had a credibility problem, that it was “aloof” when it came to issues like climate change, he said : “You cannot talk credibly about lowering emissions globally if, for example, you are slow to acknowledge climate change, if you undermine calls for an effective carbon price, and if you always descend into the ‘jobs versus environment’ argument in the public debate.” That speech was a far cry from the usual backslapping fare at the annual event and it put some noses out of joint. But it was welcomed by those who knew that Van Beurden was no fluffy liberal. “ Follow the money ,” was his mantra during a stint at Shell’s chemicals division, according to one colleague. Now, his message to the industry was: follow the overwhelming evidence on greenhouse gas emissions and join the debate on climate change, or risk the fossil fuel industry being sidelined. But Shell’s own business model, and in particular a career-defining takeover executed by Van Beurden within two months of that industry broadside, points to a different corporate philosophy. The powerful ranks of oil and gas industry executives had not witnessed a Damascene moment. Shell, under Van Beurden, is pursuing a strategy that seems to leave the €130bn (£94bn) Anglo-Dutch group firmly among the unconverted when it comes to stopping runaway climate change. An investigation into the Shell business shows that under its forecasts the Earth’s temperature will rise nearly twice as much as the 2C threshold for dangerous climate change, and that the firm’s own greenhouse gas emissions are still rising and will rocket further after the £47bn acquisition of rival BG Group . Further, Shell’s Canadian tar sands, Brazilian, Nigerian and US Gulf deep-water projects are the most likely to be rendered worthless by a global clampdown on high carbon-emitting exploration projects, analyses find. In addition, the company’s growth is becoming reliant on drilling wells (some deeper than the one that caused BP’s Gulf blowout) and it is a member of the American Legislative Exchange Council , a political organisation that has opposed policies to address climate change. A stark counterpoint to Van Beurden’s speech comes from a 2013 Shell New Lens Scenario planning document which suggests industry talk of lowering global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions is just that. Referring to the internationally agreed limit on a global temperature rise of 2C, the document states: “Both our scenarios and the IEA (International Energy Agency) New Policies scenario (and our base case energy demand and outlook) do not limit emissions to be consistent with the back-calculated 450 parts per million (CO2 in the atmosphere) 2C. We also do not see governments taking the steps now that are consistent with the 2C scenario.” According to one estimate, that Shell statement is tantamount to acknowledging that the world will disastrously vault over the 2C limit. Charlie Kronick, climate campaigner at Greenpeace, estimates that the IEA middle New Policies scenario cited by Shell leaves the Earth facing a temperature increase of 3.7C as fossil fuels continue to be burned. Shell strategy = catastrophic climate change. Do @wellcometrust  @gatesfoundation want that? http://t.co/YtXfPcnQf4  #keepitintheground Work by international scientists has warned that a 4C rise in the planet’s temperature would bring severe droughts globally and millions of migrants seeking refuge as food supplies collapse. Desertification of parts of the globe would force agriculture on to untouched areas of the planet, while populations would have to adapt to rising sea levels, extreme weather and increasing levels of agricultural pests and diseases, according to a collection of papers published by the Royal Society in 2010. Meanwhile, a recent, seismic corporate event put even greater distance between Van Beurden’s words and reality. On 8 April Shell’s chief executive shocked the industry by announcing the acquisition of BG Group , the former exploration arm of British Gas, now one of the world’s biggest gas producers. Having warned industry colleagues about the discredited trade-off between jobs and the environment, Van Beurden put growth first in emphatic fashion. The BG deal is the biggest takeover in the company’s history and it clearly propels Shell deeper into fossil fuel extraction. Putting the two businesses together makes a growing carbon footprint even bigger. Shell’s direct greenhouse gas emissions from facilities were 76m tonnes on a CO2-equivalent basis in 2014, up 4% from 73m tonnes 12 months earlier. Operations directly under BG’s control in 2014 emitted 7.6m tonnes of greenhouse gases , an increase of about 600,000 tonnes, or 9%, on 2013. If regulators let the new partnership proceed, Shell will be increasing its oil and gas reserves by 25%, raising production by 20% and employing almost 100,000 staff. This would be a big boost given that Shell, which in its early incarnation nearly a century ago boasted of producing 11% of the world’s oil, has struggled to find its own oil and gas reserves through the drill bit. Fadel Gheit, the highly respectedindustry analyst, described the transaction as “one of the best deals the industry has ever seen”. But Pascal Menges, manager of the Lombard Odier Global Energy Fund , which invests in the energy sector, sees failure as the driving motive behind the deal. “This shows that big oil’s growth strategy over the last 10 years is bust,” he argued. “Having bet enormous sums on eye-wateringly expensive oil production from oil sands, ultra-deep water and Arctic fields, the super majors are now ill-placed to cope with a low oil price,” he said, although oil had recently recovered from a perilous low of less than $50 per barrel this year – a price which makes profitable oil and gas exploration very difficult – to around $65. Menges also highlighted a trend pushing Shell into exploring difficult parts of the world – such as the Canadian tar sands, Nigeria, and deep water off Brazil and the US Gulf (underlined by the US government’s controversial decision on 11 May to allow Shell to restart drilling in the Arctic, off the coast of Alaska). Shell has either taken most accessible oil and gas fields or had its path blocked by states engaged in resource nationalism – governments giving licences to state-owned companies at the expense of foreign multinationals. Shell is upfront that its takeover of BG is about profit and capability. A spokeswoman said: “By combining BG’s portfolio and skills set with Shell’s capabilities we can deliver a step change in the growth priorities for both of our companies. This means more deep water and more LNG [liquefied natural gas] plays where we have strong profitability and capabilities.” This retreat to some of the most inaccessible and technically challenging oil and gas fields in the world poses, however, a further threat to Shell: the possibility of these projects being forcibly mothballed if there is global action to head off a rise of more than 2C. Research from Carbon Tracker , a climate change thinktank, highlights all these areas – the Canadian tar sands, the US Gulf and Alaska – as being at the highest risk from enforced mothballing and becoming “stranded assets” tying up billions of pounds worth of shareholder funds. This analysis was given further weight by a study for the Norwegian government by the industry consultancy Rystad Energy. It concluded that even if the world managed to remain within the 2C limit the “largest stranded areas are offshore North and South America, west Africa and in the Arctic”. The BG Group deal gives Shell a significant stake in one of the most technically challenging – not to mention potentially stranded – deep water projects in the world. In the previous decade Brazil made a mammoth oil discovery off its Atlantic coast and Shell inherited BG’s investments in those fields. The fields off Brazil are at depths of 2,100 metres (7,000 ft) compared with the 1,500 metres that BP was operating in when its Deepwater Horizon rig blew up in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 during a drilling operation. Deep water is expensive to operate in and, as BP found out, an environment where the consequences of serious accidents are harder to manage. But Van Beurden rejects the stranded asset argument for Shell. In a speech to Columbia University, in New York, last September, he said: “In our opinion, the ‘stranded assets’ thesis underestimates the significance of rising energy demand. It underplays the role natural gas will perform in the global energy system, especially in replacing coal power plants. And it ignores the potential of innovations like carbon capture and storage.” With Shell’s involvement in such controversial areas there is also scrutiny of its lobbying efforts. The Union of Concerned Scientists in the US has started a campaign against Shell over its continued involvement in the American Legislative Exchange Council (Alec), a rightwing nonprofit organisation that has been criticised for drafting model legislation that denies any human contribution to climate change. While companies such as Occidental Petroleum and Google have left Alec – Google’s executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, alleged last year “ they’re just literally lying ” about climate change – Shell argues that it supports the organisation because it promotes job creation and the free market. In a statement, it said: “We are members of Alec and several other similar groups across the political spectrum that foster bipartisan exchanges between elected officials. In terms of Alec, we specifically support their pro-growth, pro-jobs agenda and generally find commonality on issues important to the oil and gas industry. “While there are some issues on which we have different views, we look at the totality of the organisation not a single issue. This is the case with other organisations as well.” Some critics say the “responsible image” of Shell moving into a cleaner gas sector via the BG deal masks a fossil fuel company struggling for survival in a world facing climate change. “This is not an evil guy leading the world to destruction. He is just leading a company that is trying to find a way of maintaining this [fossil fuels] system,” said Ike Teuling, energy campaigner with Friends of the Earth Netherlands. Fittingly for a pragmatic Dutchman, There is considerable latitude in Van Beurden’s stance on climate change. He argues that global warming is a significant issue that needs tackling but not in a way that distracts attention away from the reality of growing population, increasing prosperity and growing energy demand. “Today, three billion people still lack access to the modern energy many of us take for granted,” he said. “This isn’t just about having a dustbuster or a TV set. Energy access often makes the difference between poverty and prosperity. At the same time, demand is growing. There will be more people on this planet, more people living in cities and more people rising from poverty. They will all need energy if they are to thrive. The issue is how to balance one moral obligation, energy access for all, against the other: fighting climate change.”. This allows Van Beurden to indicate that fossil fuel critics are largely based in the largely prosperous west and are denying prosperity to those developing countries such as China and India who need oil and gas energy to become more prosperous themselves. Included in Van Beurden’s industry speech in that hotel ballroom there were excerpts that endorsed the status quo. “Yes, climate change is real. And yes, renewables are an indispensable part of the future energy mix. But no, provoking a sudden death of fossil fuels isn’t a plausible plan,” he suggested. Nothing in Shell’s current strategy suggests Van Beurden is going to present a plausible alternative."

A spokesperson said: We welcome the fact that the intelligence chiefs acknowledged that they need to be more open as a result of the Snowden disclosures, but were surprised that unlike in the US and Europe there was no substantive discussion at all about anything Snowden revealed. The disastrous loss of classified data was not the responsibility of journalists but of the intelligence community itself. It is only the involvement of global newspapers that prevented this information from spilling out across the web and genuinely causing a catastrophic leak.

My colleague Owen Bowcott will post a full report here .  4.38pm GMT  Meanwhile, in the House of Lords , Lord Foulkes, a former member of the intelligence and security committee, has just laid into it for "inadequate" scrutiny of Britain's spying agencies and has called for it to be radically overhauled, Rowena Mason reports. The former Labour minister said he had had difficulty holding the intelligence services to account when he sat on the committee responsible for their oversight. He argued that its secrecy "would do MI6 proud" and said it did not instil confidence to have former foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind as chairman. One of the biggest problems is its membership, which includes too many "stalwards pillars of the establishment", he added. Foulkes told the House of Lords: "Some of the recent reports have shown the inadequacy of the scrutiny of the intelligence and security committee of those services as it is currently comprised. I'm not surprised, frankly, by what's happened. For four years I served as the only representative of this house on the nine-person committee and I experienced some of the difficulties of scrutiny of the intelligence services. I had some radical ideas and changes to propose ... but I was surprised that I was summarily removed from that committee by the coalition, but what was even more disturbing is that no Labour peer was appointed by the prime minister in my place. "I have great admiration for the many qualities of the two peers appointed. I doubt however that the Marquis of Lothian and Lord Butler actually have as the top of the list a reputation for radical and challenging questioning. Two more stalwart pillars of the establishment would be harder to find ... The secrecy surrounding the way in which this committee is to be constituted would do MI6 proud. It is not the open procedure that parliament ought to have. "Like any other joint committee, this house should have roughly half the members. I would suggest the committee ought to be increased to 11 members. I think the chair should be a member of the opposition party like the chair of the public accounts committee to give it greater credibility. "I have great respect for the current chair, Sir Malcolm Rifkind – in fact I have known him for 50 years. But it doesn't honestly instil confidence in the public and in parliament that the committee will undertake radical and effective scrutiny when you've got in the chair someone who has so recently [1995-97] been foreign secretary ... In order for it to be seen as effective and impartial, I would suggest the members of the committee need to be chosen by as democratic a procedure as we possibly can devise." He also pointed out the committee had its investigating staff member taken away from it "because no doubt he was investigating too much". Updated at 4.39pm GMT  4.08pm GMT  The appearance of MI5’s Andrew Parker, MI6’s Sir John Sawers and GCHQ’s Sr Iain Lobban before the intelligence and security committee has come to an end. Here are the key points: •  Mark Field, a member of the committee, said the committee had not been aware of all the “intricacies” in the spy programmes revealed by the Guardian and asked for a “comprehensive update” of all collaboration with foreign agencies in a closed session, which Lobban agreed to. Field said: We were very much aware of your capabilities in the past, but we weren’t aware of the intricacies to which Hazel Blears has just referred. Whilst we appreciate that a lot of this is confidential about the sort of cooperation you have with other overseas agencies, will you give us an assurance that at the earliest opportunity in a closed session of this committee you will give us a comprehensive update on collaborations that were taking place with overseas intelligence agencies? •  Lobban denied that the mass surveillance programmes revealed by Edward Snowden meant the intelligence agencies were reading everyone’s emails or listening to their calls. “I do not look at the surrounding hay”, he said, using the metaphor of looking for a needle in a haystack. If you are a threat or you are in contact with someone who is a threat you may be monitored, Lobban said. If not, not. If he asked his staff to snoop, “they’d leave the building”, he said. He said the agencies did not do anything outside the law. Parker said over the years governments had offered them greater powers “and we’ve said they’re disproportionate and turned away from them”. •  The Snowden leaks have been “very damaging”, Sawers said. “They have put our operations at risk … Al-Qaida are lapping it up.” Lobban said terrorist groups in the Middle East and Afghanistan had been discussing the revelations in specific terms and had discussed moving to other “communications packages”. The three chiefs were unwilling to provide more specific examples of this damage in public, although they said they would do so to the MPs in a closed session. •  Asked why the public had not been entitled to know about the mass surveillance programmes and had only found out about them via the Guardian, Lobban said some things were “necessarily secret” and “should remain secret”. Secret did not mean sinister, he said. Lobban said an “active debate” had been going on even before the Snowden revelations about where the line of secrecy needed to be drawn. •  Asked if the existing framework of oversight for the security services was adequate, Lobban said that was a matter for parliament but he thought it “did a pretty good job”. But if parliament chose to have a debate and change the laws, that was “fine by him”. Parker expressed frustration that his (closed-door) meetings with the home secretary, the ISC and the intelligence commissioners that make up MI5’s oversight regime did not “get into the public mind”. Oversight was “very rigorous”, Sawers said. •  The number of people who have travelled to Syria from Britain to fight in the civil war and are either still there or have come back is in the low hundreds, Parker said. Most will not attack Britain, but some might, he said. •  Sawers denied MI6 spied on “everyone”, saying there were only a few countries where the Secret Intelligence Service actually had operations.  3.38pm GMT  Legal pressure group Reprieve has called the session a "damp squib" that demonstrates why the ISC gives inadequate oversight of the security services. Its strategic director Cori Crider said: Today’s hearing was billed as a grilling, but was nothing more than a damp squib. It gave a clear demonstration, if one were needed, of just how inadequate the ISC is as a watchdog on the intelligence services. One of the many elephants in the room was the UK’s involvement in Libyan rendition and torture. Not one member of the ISC asked about MI6’s role in ‘rendering’ the wives and children of Gaddafi opponents back to the dictator’s prisons in 2004 – an incident of which the ISC was completely unaware when it cleared the services of involvement in rendition and torture in 2007. They also failed to question GCHQ over its role in providing support to the CIA’s covert drone programme – which has killed hundreds of civilians in Pakistan and Yemen, and violates international law.  3.35pm GMT  Tory MP Dominic Raab has been in touch to say: For the first time, intelligence chiefs gave public evidence about the scope of their activities and powers. It punctures the myth that ensuring the agencies are more transparent and accountable comes at a price to UK national security. In fact, strengthening oversight will make the agencies more effective, preserve the rule of law and safeguard public confidence.  3.35pm GMT  Campbell asks about North Korea. It is a big concern, but not as high an operational concern as other parts of the world, Sawers says. Julian Lewis asks about espionage in the UK. Does traditional espionage, say from Russia, still pose a threat? Would it be true to say that everyone is still spying on everyone else? Parker says 10% of his work arises from threats from foreign states, most of that being espionage. “It’s still a lively business here.” There are a range of countries involved, he says. Rifkind asks about the murder of Alexander Litvinenko. Sawers says we have not had the cooperation we sought from the Russians on that case. Recently they have been talking about security for the Sochi Olympics, though. “We will take it forward step by step.” Lewis asks again: would it be true to say that everyone is still spying on everyone else? Sawers says terrorism, cyber, nuclear issues are the vast bulk of what they do. Of course we don’t spy on everyone. There are very few countries where we actively have operations. We are targeting the highest priorities of the government, he says. Rifkind closes by looking forward to more open sessions in future. Sawers wants to have one last word. He says all three of them feel that the great value of the services comes from the great and committed members of staff who work for the agencies. “Our people are the backbone of what we do.” With that the session ends.  3.29pm GMT  What is the main lesson you have learned from the Iraqi intelligence failings? Sawers says “there were clearly shortcomings back in 2002 and we’ve learnt an enormous amount from those”.  3.28pm GMT  In the context of some of the spy chiefs' comments, it is worth noting that Guardian stories on the Snowden revelations have been published after consultation with the government's DA Notice committee, with intelligence agencies themselves, or with officials in Whitehall. Following those discussions the Guardian has agreed not to publish certain things, and has made independent decisions to redact certain details, names, locations and operations.  3.27pm GMT  Lord Butler asks if the intelligence community has made a contribution to the tentative detente with Iran over its nuclear programme. Yes, it has, says Sawers. Our intelligence has informed that picture, he says. The impact of sanctions has helped, and MI6 has helped monitor those sanctions and stop Iran evading them, he says. Plus MI6's expertise on Iran's "very complicated politics" is always available to the government.  3.25pm GMT  Parker says MI5 extends surveillance to potential recruiting sergeants for extremists in the UK.  3.24pm GMT  MI5 sometimes recommends people for the Prevent programme, Parker says.  3.24pm GMT  Rifkind moves on to Syria and the Arab Spring. Paul Goggins asks about what MI6 is doing to stop people going abroad to fight and perhaps coming back radicalised. Sawers says they work with foreign partners and “have our own connections into the Syrian opposition” but it is a very difficult environment to operate in. “We have no partner there”, he says, presumably referring to the Syrian government. Does he have numbers of people who have returned to the UK and now might “turn their attention towards UK citizens”? The low hundreds is the total number of people who are there now fighting and have come back, Parker says. Most will not try to attack Britain, but some may, he says. Blears says some of these people will find it easy to draw vulnerable young people to them and radicalise them because of the “kudos” they have gained through fighting in Syria. That may happen, says Parker. MI5 overlaps with the government’s Prevent anti-radicalisation programme, he says.  3.19pm GMT  Rifkind acts about the impact of the Human Rights Act on their work. Parker says the acts they work under are based on that. It’s at the centre and foundation of their work. Lord Butler asks if they can see why the public feels that when the last bit of legislation on this was published in 2000, it’s hardly credible that that legislation is fit for the modern world. Parker says the real issue for them is whether the work they do is sufficiently covered by the law and is properly overseen. He admits that that oversight does not “get into the public mind”. He recounts his meetings with the committee, the home secretary, the commissioners - but that is not communicated to the public, he says. (Presumably the meetings are all behind closed doors.)  3.15pm GMT  Lobban says they talk to the intelligence service commissioner and the interception of communication commissioners who about the implications of new technology. They don’t sit in public, but they produce a public report. (The two commissioners are part of the oversight regime for the three agencies.) Lobban says he is concerned about access to communications companies based overseas.  3.13pm GMT  Campbell says the public needs to know there is a robust legal framework for their actions. Is the existing framework adequate for the enormous consequences of the revolution in technology? Lobban says legislation is an issue for politicians. He says privacy v security is a false choice. The laws were drafted to be technology-neutral and the draftsmen “did a pretty good job”. Necessity and proportionality are key, when the laws were drafted and now. But if parliament chooses to have a debate and/or change the laws, fine by him.  3.11pm GMT  Howarth says people will not be convinced that because you have to have access to suspects, you have to have access to the innocent too. “I do not look at the surrounding hay,” Lobban says. “We will not look at it without a specific authorisation.” Rifkind says it is sometimes argued that the revelations have been in general terms and have not named names. Sawers says journalists are not particularly well-placed to make those judgements. “The leaks from Snowden have been very damaging. They have put our operations at risk … Al-Qaida are lapping it up.” Why does he believe that? Sawers refers back to Lobban and Parker’s comments.  3.08pm GMT  Rifkind asks about Parker’s Rusi speech calling revelations such as the Guardian’s a “gift” to terrorists. Can he or Lobban give specific examples? Parker says that’s difficult, although they could do it in private. But he says detecting terrorists’ communications saves lives, including this year, and that advantage can be “fragile”, “making a difficult task even harder”. Lobban says much of their success relies upon terrorists being unaware of it. He says terrorist groups in the Middle East and Afghanistan have been discussing the revelations in specific terms and discussed moving to other “communications packages”. He says he is not going to compound the damage by being specific in public, but he will in private. “It is a direct consequence” of the Snowden revelations in the press, he says. The cumulative effect will make their task far, far harder in the future, Lobban says. Uncovering terrorist cells, revealing people shipping materials or expertise around the world, battling online sexual exploitation of children, all that is in a much weaker place than it was before the revelations, he says.  3.04pm GMT  Sawers says all companies are trying to use modern technologies to achieve their goals. Why should keeping the country safe be excluded from this? Oversight is “very rigorous in our case”. We need to have the possibility of examining the intelligence and identify the brave individuals who are prepared to work with us to attack threats. Blears says it is important to look at the balance between privacy and security. Any comments? Parker says an organisation like MI5 needs to protect the sort of country we live in against threats - a free society, a democracy, which prizes privacy and liberty. Those values are important to the staff of MI5. They don’t want to live in a surveillance society or North Korea. MI5 is not arguing for more intrusion and more and more powers, he says. We are trying to help the government keep the balance, he says. Over the years governments have offered the services greater powers “and we’ve said they’re disproportionate and turned away from them”.  3.00pm GMT  Rifkind says the agencies can sometimes be too quick to want to keep things secret. Parker says he is not sure about that - we have to keep things secret from the people we are trying to track. That will leave the UK less safe, he says.  2.59pm GMT  Blears says the public supports the agencies’ powers but want more transparency.Lobban says if you are a threat or you are in contact with someone who is a threat you may be monitored. If not, not. Parker of MI5 says the agencies have been becoming gradually more open over the last 20 years. These are matters for ministers and parliament to set law about, and the agencies will then abide by that, Parker says.  2.57pm GMT  Mark Field wants a “comprehensive update” of all collaboration with foreign agencies - in a closed session. Lobban agrees to that.  2.56pm GMT  Blears asks if GCHQ is using its relations with the US to circumvent British law. The committee found it was not. Lobban confirms that GCHQ does not do anything that is outside the law “and I’m sure that’s the same for my sister agencies as well”. Updated at 2.59pm GMT  2.55pm GMT  Is he giving thought to whether the line of secrecy needs to be redrawn safely, Rifkind asks? That has been an active debate even before the recent revelations, Lobban says.  2.54pm GMT  Lobban uses the metaphor of looking for needles in a haystack. We draw out the needles and do not intrude on the surrounding hay, he says. We don’t want to delve into innocent emails and phone calls, he says. I don’t employ the kind of people who would do, Lobban says. If they were asked to snoop “they’d leave the building”, he says. Why was the British public not entitled to know this before now? A government’s first duty is to protect its people, and some ways it does that “are necessarily secret”. The foreign secretary, this committee, and the two relevant commissioners have oversight of this (in secret). “I believe that certain methods should remain secret,” he says. He does not believe secret means sinister.  2.52pm GMT  Lord Butler asks about cyber-crime. Lobban of GCHQ runs through the different types: state cyber-crime, industrial cyber-crime. The response has to be across and beyond government, he says. If we get that right, we can be “world class in terms of cyber, the UK”, he says. Lobban says GCHQ is working with academia to create “a cyber-generation”. Some would say the real cyber threat comes from GCHQ seeking to collect everyone’s information, says Rifkind. Why is this necessary? Lobban says we do not spend our time reading the emails and listening to the calls of the vast majority. Terrorists use the same means as ordinary people “so we have to do detective work”.  2.48pm GMT  Over time the Northern Ireland threat is diminishing and eventually we will see a Northern Ireland without terrorism, he says.  2.47pm GMT  Lord Lothian asks if the agencies have taken their eye off the ball regarding Northern Ireland since Islamist terrorism began to grow. Parker says not. In NI there is a small number of people involved in terrorism, “a residue … from a bygone era”. Northern Ireland has moved on. What about the murder of prison officer David Black, and the plans of dissident republicans? The number of attacks there is diminishing and the number convicted is increasing, Parker says.  2.45pm GMT  Has the number of MI5 operations gone up, Campbell asks. What about during the Olympics? There were some plots during the Olympics but "they didn't happen", he says. The number of prosecutions for international terrorism through the courts is 330 since 9/11, he says.  2.44pm GMT  Julian Lewis asks if there has been a shift towards “lone wolf”, low-level attacks rather than spectaculars. It’s not so much a shift as we’ve seen different methods of terrorism being added over the years, Parker says. In one plot the terrorists were talking on covert microphones about a plan that would have been bigger than 7/7, he says, so that is still on the table. Paul Goggins says them home secretary has said there has been no increase in risk from Terrorism prevention and investigation measures (TPIMs). Is that right? Parker says that is a judgment based on the whole “target set”, not just individuals on Tpims, and “it remains true”.  2.38pm GMT  Do the deaths of British people over the last 10 years represent an intelligence failure, George Howarth asks. And what part does luck play in their success? Parker says he “absolutely rejects the term intelligence failure”. He does not judge 7/7 as a failure for the agencies. There have been 34 plots since 7/7 that have been disrupted “at all sizes and stages”, he says. “One or two of those are major plots, mass casualty,” he says. Most have been disrupted by action from the agencies and the police. One or two “failed because they just failed; the plans didn’t come together”.  2.36pm GMT  How do they assess the threat in a particular area? That rests with JTAC (the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre ), says Parker. But does he exercise independent judgment, Sir Menzies Campbell asks. It’s a joint effort, says Parker, between people in each of our agencies. Lord Lothian asks if “terrorist tourism” is a growing threat? Parker says it has been growing, because of Syria. “Low hundreds” of people go to Syria and come back, he says. Updated at 2.54pm GMT  2.33pm GMT  A very important strand is British al-Qaida sympathisers travelling abroad, Parker says. Britons can go abroad and be sent back to attack in the UK. That is why the three agencies work so closely together, Sawers says.  2.32pm GMT  Paul Goggins asks if the agencies are spread too thinly in this new situation. Sawers says they are having to deal with al-Qaida “emerging and forming and multiplying in a whole new range of countries”. More British citizens have been killed overseas in 2013 than in the previous seven years put together: in Algeria and Kenya (he also mentions Woolwich, although that is obviously not overseas).  2.30pm GMT  Parker says there has been no terrorism against the UK from Afghanistan since the war began because of our armed forces. He says the period after 9/11 was dominated by threats from south Asia, including “people living here”. That led to the 7/7 attack, which “signalled a big shift” in counter-terrorism when “much stronger resourcing” was introduced by the government. Since then the threat has spread out, but it is not a shift or a displacement, it is the growth of the al-Qaida phenomenon in parts of Africa and in Syria, he says.  2.28pm GMT  Sawers says he was glad the Justice and Security Act now allows the agencies to defend themselves against allegations in court. Parker of MI5 says that if questioning of a suspect would lead to mistreatment or torture, would they go ahead? “The answer is absolutely not.”  2.26pm GMT  How would he react if he knew an individual had vital information to prevent an attack? Sawers says they would do everything within the law. If he wants to ask questions that might result in torture, he would ask a minister, and if he thought it definitely would result in torture, "we wouldn't even bother a minister" about it.  2.23pm GMT  How can he be sure MI6 is not complicit in torture? Sawers says he does not accept the allegations against MI6. But with hindsight MI6 was “not configured” to the threat it faced after 9/11. “But we learnt pretty quickly.” New guidance is now in place, he says, and “if there is any doubt, we put it to ministers”. Sir Menzies Campbell says the situation officers may find themselves in may be very “dynamic”. What do they do when an officer comes back and says they had to make their decision? The idea of sending an agent off into the field and he comes back in two months is a bit James Bond, Sawers says. We have a system for enabling guidance to be issued from head office 24/7, he says. If the facts are uncertain, “we will wake the foreign secretary up” and get his view. He says he is very satisfied with the “rigorous compliance procedures now in place”.  2.20pm GMT  Blears asks about the risks of working with foreign intelligence, particularly regarding their human rights standards. Sawers of MI6 says the problem is the threats don’t come from western democracies, they come from ungoverned states, states where terrorists operate or the government is pursuing nuclear weapons. In those countries we have to work with the national security players, he says. If a British extremist has gone to a foreign country, it’s important for the UK that an eye is kept on him - only the local powers can do that, Sawers says. So how can he be sure an action he takes does not result in somebody being mistreated? Sawers says we only operate under the law, and there are some countries such as Syria that we cannot work with for that reason. With countries with “mixed human rights records” we seek assurances that if anyone is detained “it is done to our standards”. “There is sometimes a fine balance here,” he says.  2.17pm GMT  Julian Lewis says if a "junior clerk" with a memory stick can copy thousands of documents, want measures can be taken against that? Parker says there is tightly controlled IT access and physical security of our premises – plus vetting of personnel. That makes it extremely unlikely to have these breaches. So it happened in the US but couldn't happen in the UK? Parker says there has only been one incident and it was small-scale. All three chiefs are involved in discussions with the US on this subject, he says.  2.15pm GMT  How has technology changed their roles, George Howarth asks, and has it helped the agencies or the terrorists more. Lobban of GCHQ says the internet is the first challenge for the agencies. We need highly skilled people to analyse it. And we need global partnerships, he says. It has helped the terrorists and our job has got harder, he says, allowing them to communicate, plan and spread ideas and propaganda. We have had some successes turning that against them – "I think those are best kept secret." Lobban says intelligence capabilities online have also been used to deal with child exploitation. Parker of MI5 says they are in "an accelerating technology race" as "all of our lives are moving on to the internet".  2.11pm GMT  Lord Lothian asks why the end of the cold war, 9/11, and the Arab Spring were not predicted by the agencies. Sawers says “we are not crystal ball gazers”. To take the Arab Spring, “there wasn’t something out there that we missed”, he says. It was the same with 9/11 and the end of the cold war, he says. Intelligence agencies acquire secrets other countries and agencies don’t want us to know, but “we are not all-knowing”.  2.09pm GMT  Hazel Blears asks about the new threats, including cyber-attacks. Sawers says there is now an unprecedented level of collaboration between the three agencies. Updated at 2.12pm GMT  2.08pm GMT  Rifkind asks Parker of MI5 why the size and cost of the agencies went up not down following the end of the cold war. Parker says £2bn is a great amount of money; that scale is set by ministers. That £2bn is roughly 6% of the nation's defence budget. Ministers must feel that is proportionate, he says. He says he does not believe his work damages freedom and democracy - in fact the opposite.  2.07pm GMT  Rifkind asks Sawers of MI6 who poses the biggest threat to our national security today. Sawers says it is not like it was in the cold war, states trying to destroy our government and way of life, but there are very diverse threats: the biggest is terrorism. Then there are states that want to harm us, he says. MI6 and GCHQ also support the armed forces, he says.  2.05pm GMT  The time delay is a "safety mechanism" to allow the committee to pause the broadcast if anything is said that endangers national security, Rifkind says. He does not expect to have to pause the session, however.  2.04pm GMT  Rifkind says the open session is a very significant step forward, but he will not be asking witnesses for secret information. He says they will not talk about the death of Lee Rigby either, so as not to prejudice the trial.  2.03pm GMT  Rifkind starts by welcoming the three chiefs to the committee.  2.02pm GMT  The three spy chiefs have taken their places: MI6 chief Sir John Sawers , director of GCHQ Sir Iain Lobban and director-general of MI5 Andrew Parker . To remind you of the members of the committee: •  Sir Malcolm Rifkind MP, former Tory foreign secretry (chair) •  Hazel Blears MP, former Labour communities secretary •  Lord Butler of Brockwell, crossbench peer •  Sir Menzies Campbell MP, former Lib Dem leader •  Mark Field MP, former Tory shadow minister •  Paul Goggins MP, former Labour Northern Ireland minister •  George Howarth MP, former Labour undersecretary in the Northern Ireland Office and Home Office •  Julian Lewis MP, former Tory shadow minister •  Lord Lothian QC, former deputy Tory leader  2.01pm GMT  The link has appeared now on the site .  1.50pm GMT  You will be able to watch the hearing live by clicking here . But the link itself won't appear until 2pm (perhaps for security reasons).  1.39pm GMT  Mobiles have been banned from the committee room for the ISC's hearing, ITV's Lucy Manning reports. About to head in to see spy chiefs being questioned by Parliament. Phones banned in room so no tweeting from me. Follow @itvnews for updates  12.44pm GMT  In today's Guardian, John Kampfner , the former chief executive of Index on Censorship, argues that Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping are closer than they have ever been to mastering who is saying and doing what online. They and other authoritarian leaders are watching with glee as US intelligence agencies destroy what is left of the original utopian vision of a cyberspace free of government control.  12.34pm GMT  Twenty-eight Tory MPs have written to the Guardian's editor, Alan Rusbridger, asking him to consult the government or security services before publishing any further stories based on the Snowden documents and calling on the newspaper to inform the government and intelligence services of the precise nature of the information it has shared with other journalists and bloggers and the identities of those to whom it has passed information. In their letter, the MPs said that publishing the leaked information "runs the risk of compromising the vital work of the institutions, processes and people who protect the safety of this country". They asked the newspaper to accept that it shares responsibility for the safety of UK citizens and to "act accordingly" with its stories, to discuss with the intelligence services the implications for national security that publication would have, and to be explicit about any information it has released that could threaten the safety of intelligence services personnel. Highlighting the security risks that might occur if information intended for other journalists fell into the hands of terrorists or "hostile foreign powers", the MPs asked the Guardian to be open with the government and security agencies about exactly what information it had shared, and with whom. They said: We are asking you to do no more than to share with our intelligence services, the very people who protect the freedoms which the Guardian champions, that which you have already shared freely with international bloggers and journalists who have no concept of the UK national interest.  12.09pm GMT  Once again, barrister Carl Gardner of the Head of Legal blog is doing an excellent job of tweeting the David Miranda hearing, which is expected to conclude today. Here are some highlights. Lord Justice Laws is one of the judges hearing the case, and Steven Kovats QC is speaking for the home secretary. Laws LJ: is some intention needed for endangering life within the definition of terrorism? Kovats: No. #Miranda Kovats: if you read the definition of terrorism narrowly you'll knock the whole Terrorism Act 2000 out of kilter #Miranda Kovats now referring to the Guardian/Sarah Tisdall case about leaked photocopy civil service documents #Miranda Kovats: the raw Snowden data is valuable in its own right unlike the Tisdall documents which were wanted to identify her. #Miranda Here's more on the Sarah Tisdall case . Kovats: there's more to terrorism than setting off bombs #Miranda Kovats: simply having this data is terrorism because of the risk of it being taken from you, even if you don't plan to publish #Miranda Laws LJ: what about a courier who doesn't know what he has? Kovats: he's covered too by the s1 definition #Miranda Ouseley J: it'd be odd if you knew vital documents were being carried by an innocent courier, and had to let them through #Miranda Mr Justice Ouseley is one of the other judges hearing the case. Laws LJ: I'm not sure I know the meaning of the phrase "responsible journalism" ... #Miranda Laws LJ: .. it doesn't make a journalist omniscient in security matters. It's just rhetoric, really #Miranda Jason Beer QC has been speaking for the Metropolitan police. Jason Beer QC: in this case it's not the traveller but the documents he carried that triggered the need to examine him #Miranda Beer: it's a legitimate purpose to examine the data. It may show someone's intentions about publication. Mentions Julian Assange #Miranda  11.25am GMT  In this video interview , Labour's Douglas Alexander, the shadow foreign secretary, says "there is a heavy responsible on the government both to make sure that systems are secure, where information is contained, and in that sense I think that the primary responsibility moving forward rests with the government to make sure they're offering both the assurances that are required and the explanations that are needed".  11.19am GMT  As mentioned earlier, WikiLeaks's Sarah Harrison has now left Edward Snowden in Russia and is living in Berlin. Tagesschau has the full statement Harrison, who is British, put out about her move here ( in German ). "The United States should no longer be able to spy on every person on this planet and at the same time pursue those who speak this truth," she says. And in relation to the ongoing David Miranda case, she write: "It is absurd to describe as terrorism journalism whose goal is to report on national security, to ensure an honest government or enforce the most basic of civil rights. But the British government has decided to interpret the law that way." For this reason her lawyers have advised her not to return to the UK, she says. At yesterday's Miranda hearing at the high court, the home secretary's QC Steven Kovats raised the idea that publication of material obtained by Snowden was capable of being an act of terrorism - adding that the home secretary "submits that it is". "It is not a crime to tell the truth," Harrison adds, echoing a recent line of Snowden's. "It's our data, our information, our history. We have to fight so that it belongs to us again."  10.50am GMT  Former Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald also appeared on Radio 4 this morning. He challenged the performance of the ISC, saying: I think the system has failed to exercise meaningful accountability up to this point because there was a huge suspicionless system of mass spying that the British and American people had no idea had been built in their name. But I think that system can bring about real accountability if there is the political will. He challenged claims that the Guardian's journalism had damaged national security, saying no evidence had been produced to justify those assertions.  10.06am GMT  On BBC Radio 4 this morning, former head of GCHQ Sir David Omand claimed the effectiveness of the committee itself was as much on show as the spy chiefs themselves, as Patrick Wintour reports . Omand accused the former Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald and other reporters of "dodging around the issue of damage to public security". He asserted: "As a result of the revelations we know less about the people who are trying to harm us and we are therefore less safe." He urged journalists to to be honest about the damage, but that they justify this because of the greater public good. If there was such an admission, it would be possible to have a debate, he said. "I have argued for a long time that the government should have been more open about the purpose of intelligence and the general ways in an internet age you have to go about accessing intelligence. That debate is perfectly reasonable." He rejected as nonsense claims in the Guardian that one reason why the intelligence agencies had argued against the use of intercept evidence in court trials was because it wished to keep secret the scale of its intelligence gathering. Omand said he was proud of the British collaboration with American intelligence agencies, saying: "We have the brains, they have the money". He added that it was an open matter of debate about how GCHQ was funded by the US. At last week's Westminster Hall debate, MPs questioned whether the members of the intelligence and security committee had actually known about the NSA's Prism internet surveillance programme and GCHQ's Tempora internet-cable-tapping programme before the Guardian revealed them. George Howarth gave the impression that the MPs had not known, while chair Sir Malcolm Rifkind said the MPs questioning him had no idea whether his committee knew about the programmes because secret information like that had to be kept secret. But this morning Omand said he was sure the ISC would have had detailed briefings on the scale of GCHQ's activity, but in private. He said: The ISC has now been reconstituted. It is now a proper committee of parliament. They have got new powers. They are on show this afternoon every bit as much as the three heads of agencies. They have to demonstrate they can satisfy the need for oversight and satisfy parliament that they are doing a job that in other areas of government can be done by much more open means.  9.56am GMT  Richard Norton-Taylor has profiled the three chiefs. Here is what he wrote: Lobban,53, has been director of GCHQ, the British electronic eavesdropping agency, since 2008. He has more than 6,000 staff under him and they spend the bulk of the three agencies' combined budget of £2bn. Lobban supports Everton football club, and declares his other interests as cricket, photography, travel and birdwatching. He studied French and German at Leeds University and passed the higher command staff course at the Defence Academy at Shrivenham before joining GCHQ in 1983. GCHQ is also in the lead in fighting cyber wars, and Lobban is appealing to cyberwarriors. "[GCHQ] can offer them a fantastic mission, but … can't compete with their salaries," he has said referring to the kind of money offered by private companies. None of the chiefs seeks the spotlight, but Lobban is probably the least well-known of them all preferring to keep himself, and his Cheltenham agency, out of the Whitehall spotlight. Parker, 50, has been director general of MI5, the domestic security service, which has a staff of 3,900 officers, since April this year. He studied natural sciences at Cambridge University, and describes himself as a keen ornithologist and wildlife photographer. In a highly provocative maiden speech last month he claimed, without naming the newspaper, that by publishing leaks from the former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, the Guardian had handed a " gift to terrorists ". The claim has been questioned by MPs from all main parties and led a former director of public prosecutions, Lord Macdonald, to accuse him of using self-serving rhetoric. Parker has worked for MI5 for more than 30 years, including on Middle East terrorism, counter espionage, Northern Ireland terrorism, and serious and organised crime. He was also MI5's liaison officer in the US and deputy to the former head of MI5, Jonathan Evans. Sawers, 59, has been chief of the Secret Intelligence Service, or MI6 , since 2009. By tradition, he signs his correspondence – copies of which go to the Queen – with the letter "C" in green ink. Although he had a spell with MI6 in Yemen, most of his career was in the Foreign Office and included the post of UK ambassador to the UN. He was Tony Blair's foreign affairs private secretary from 1999 to 2001 and had a brief spell in Baghdad after the 2003 invasion. MI6 has a staff of 3,200 deployed worldwide, and its biggest overseas station is Kabul. Sawers was brought in to lift the shadows over MI6 following the scandal of the misleading Iraq weapons dossier. He gave the first public speech by the head of MI6 and said he believed the mechanisms set up to hold the intelligence agencies to account were inadequate. But he was pushed on the defensive by the revelation that MI6 played a role in the abduction of Libyan dissidents to Tripoli where they were abused by Muammar Gaddafi's secret police, and by damning criticism of MI6 following the death of Gareth Williams, a GCHQ officer seconded to MI6 – an incident for which Sawers apologised "unreservedly". He studied physics and philosophy at Nottingham University and lists his recreations as sport and the arts. He is due to retire next year.  9.45am GMT  My colleague Nick Hopkins has drawn up a list of 10 key questions the intelligence and security committee should ask the spy chiefs this afternoon. Here they are in full: 1. Stella Rimington, the former head of MI5 , and David Omand, the former director of GCHQ , have said it is time for Britain's intelligence agencies to be more transparent so the public can have greater confidence in their work. Do you agree, and how will you achieve this? 2. Former minister Chris Huhne said the existence of some of GCHQ's mass surveillance programmes were kept from the cabinet – and from members of the National Security Council. Why weren't ministers allowed to know about the programmes – particularly when they were relevant to discussions about data retention set out in the so-called snooper's charter? 3. Privacy campaigners, former cabinet ministers and even a former chair of the ISC, Lord King, have called in recent weeks for the laws that govern Britain's intelligence agencies to be overhauled. The agencies have argued against any changes. Why? What do the agencies have to fear from having more up-to-date laws? 4. Edward Snowden was one of 850,000 employees and contractors who had access to the secret material he leaked to the Guardian and others. Did the chiefs know that so many people outside the UK had access to British secrets? What has been done to reduce the numbers who can see this material? 5. Last year, 550 analysts (300 British, 250 American) were working on GCHQ's Tempora programme, which analyses calls, emails and Google search traffic coming in and out of the UK. How many are working on it now? 6. Documents seen by the Guardian describe how GCHQ regards the UK's legal regime as a "unique selling point" to be exploited when collaborating with the US. Why is Britain's legal framework deemed to be so attractive to the US? 7. The Washington Post revealed this week that GCHQ had "hacked" into Google's private fibre-optic cables in the UK as part of a joint programme with America's National Security Agency. Google said this was outrageous. Did GCHQ have legal authority to do this – and if so, which minister signed the relevant "warrant" – and when? 8. The NSA eavesdropped on Angela Merkel's mobile phone for at least 10 years. Documents also show the NSA targeted the phones of another 35 government heads. Did Britain's intelligence agencies receive any transcripts of these conversations? Did GCHQ help the NSA tap any of these calls? 9. The agencies insist they seek legal approval for all their major programmes, and that if they want information from other agencies, such as the NSA, they need warrants for that material too. But do they need warrants for information offered or gifted by another agency? 10. The former home secretary David Blunkett said this week the intelligence agencies tended to "get carried away" and their claims needed to be treated with a "breath of scepticism". What do you think he meant? And wouldn't stronger oversight of the agencies be better in the long run?  9.25am GMT  The intelligence and security committee is different to parliamentary select committees, a fact noted by many MPs in last week’s Westminster Hall debate on the security services . The committee was established in 1994 to examine the three intelligence agencies and the intelligence work of the Cabinet Office, Ministry of Defence and Home Office, and was reformed earlier this year, giving it greater powers and allowing it oversight of operational activity and “the wider intelligence and security activities of government”. Unlike select committees, whose members and the majority of whose chairs are now elected by their fellow MPs, the members of the ISC are appointed by parliament only after nomination by the prime minister. They can be members of the House of Commons and the House of Lords, and serving ministers cannot be chosen. The chair is chosen by the PM. Sir Malcolm Rifkind, the current chair, said last week that in future the committee would chose its own leader . Rifkind is a former foreign secretary and his role has been criticised in that he might be required to scrutinise decisions he made himself when he was in power. Labour’s Diana Johnson has called for reforms to the committee to give greater protection to whistleblowers and has said an opposition MP should be its chair. At Monday’s Riba debate on the Snowden revelations, Tory MP Rory Stewart made the same point, arguing: "You are never going to have a government backbencher chairing a committee that is going to criticise the government properly.” The current members of the committee are: •  Sir Malcolm Rifkind MP, former Tory foreign secretry (chair) •  Hazel Blears MP, former Labour communities secretary •  Lord Butler of Brockwell, crossbench peer •  Sir Menzies Campbell MP, former Lib Dem leader •  Mark Field MP, former Tory shadow minister •  Paul Goggins MP, former Labour Northern Ireland minister •  George Howarth MP, former Labour undersecretary in the Northern Ireland Office and Home Office •  Julian Lewis MP, former Tory shadow minister •  Lord Lothian QC, former deputy Tory leader Today’s session with the heads of MI5, MI6 and GCHQ will cover “the terrorist threat, regional instability and weapons proliferation, cyber security and espionage”. But it will not cover “details of intelligence capabilities or techniques, ongoing operations or sub judice matters”. On Monday Alan Rusbridger, the editor of the Guardian, predicted that the spy chiefs would use the session to claim that terrorists had now “gone dark” – or disappeared from their view – as a result of the paper’s stories. He quoted a 2011 article by Peter Swire of Ohio State University and Kenesa Ahmad of the Future of Privacy Forum – written before the Snowden revelations – arguing that security agencies have used the “going dark” argument for a long time, when in reality we are currently living in a “golden age of surveillance”. The article noted: This post casts new light on government agency claims that we are “going dark.” Due to changing technology, there are indeed specific ways that law enforcement and national security agencies lose specific previous capabilities. These specific losses, however, are more than offset by massive gains. Public debates should recognize that we are truly in a golden age of surveillance. It added: A simple test can help the reader decide between the “going dark” and “golden age of surveillance” hypotheses. Suppose the agencies had a choice of a 1990-era package or a 2011-era package. The first package would include the wiretap authorities as they existed pre-encryption, but would lack the new techniques for location tracking, confederate identification, access to multiple databases, and data mining. The second package would match current capabilities: some encryption-related obstacles, but increased use of wiretaps, as well as the capabilities for location tracking, confederate tracking and data mining. The second package is clearly superior - the new surveillance tools assist a vast range of investigations, whereas wiretaps apply only to a small subset of key investigations. The new tools are used far more frequently and provide granular data to assist investigators. Swire is now on Barack Obama's panel reviewing the powers of the NSA.  9.06am GMT  Good morning. Today at 2pm the three heads of the UK intelligence agencies, Sir Iain Lobban of GCHQ, Andrew Parker of MI5, and Sir John Sawers of MI6, are going to give evidence before parliament’s intelligence and security committee . The hearing will be broadcast here on a short time delay (in case anything is mentioned that might jeopardise national security), and I will live blog it. Also today David Miranda’s high court challenge to his nine-hour detention at Heathrow under the Terrorism Act last month continues, and is expected to conclude. Here Owen Bowcott and Alan Travis report on day one of the hearing, in which lawyers for Miranda – the partner of former Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald – told the high court his detention was unlawful and the first time journalistic material has been seized under a controversial provision of the Terrorism Act. Greenwald was one of the Guardian’s key reporters of the initial revelations about US and UK surveillance leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. Elsewhere today: •  Sir Tim Berners-Lee , the computer scientist who created the world wide web, has called for a "full and frank public debate" over internet surveillance by the National Security Agency and its British counterpart, GCHQ , warning that the system of checks and balances to oversee the agencies has failed. He said the agencies' decision to break the encryption software was appalling and foolish, as it directly contradicted efforts of the US and UK governments to fight cybercrime and cyberwarfare, which they have identified as a national security priority. •  Sarah Harrison, the British journalist and WikiLeaks staffer who has been working with Edward Snowden since his arrival in Moscow, has left Russia and joined the growing band of net activists stranded in Berlin . I’ll cover the ISC hearing live this afternoon, and keep abreast of as much of the Miranda hearing as I can, too. Greenwald and Sir David Omand, the former head of GCHQ, were both interviewed on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme this morning, and I’ll report on that too.

"Who goes there? Campaigners fight to keep military away from UK schools","Britain is the only EU country to enlist 16-year-olds into the armed services and, say objectors, it starts with access to the classroom  Tue 30 Aug 2016 07.30 BST   Last modified on Tue 28 Nov 2017 15.38 GMT   I t’s just after 9.30am and a group of year 9 pupils are flinging themselves across a 30m inflatable assault course installed on a playing field at Marlborough science academy in St Albans, Hertfordshire. “Come on, push through, be positive!” shout the army personnel in charge, as pupils leap on to the military version of a bouncy castle. They are being timed: at 17 seconds from start to finish, Lorna Norris, 14, is the fastest girl. She looks pleased as she and the rest of the group head over to the next set of “command tasks”, aimed at testing their leadership, teamwork and planning skills. Marlborough science academy is one of thousands of UK schools to invite in the military. Today, as part of an Insight Into Industry event, the army and other organisations – including the fire and rescue service, Marks & Spencer, and Hertfordshire University – are giving students an insider’s view of their work. Next to the assault course is a display showing salary scales for all military ranks, and male and female soldiers from different units are on hand to answer questions. A group of boys gather round Signaller Chadwick and Guardsman Rowe. “Are you all frontline?” asks Luke Davies-Collins, 14. “What’s it actually like?” There are rueful grins from the soldiers. “It’s not like it’s the Somme out there,” replies Rowe. “There’s no such thing as a frontline – the threat is all around you.” The soldiers outline a few of the training options, and explain that there’s a humanitarian aspect to the job, as well as the forces providing support at home in emergencies such as recent floods. If you want to get ahead in the military, it helps to do your best in your exams while you’re at school, Chadwick says. Later, after a bridge-building group exercise, Lillie Murphy, 14, says the activities have been exciting. Classmate Libby Douglas-Tomsett says her eyes have been opened to the career possibilities: “I didn’t know they had all those different jobs. I thought it was just going to war.” But “going to war” is often part of a military career – and that prompts controversy about whether schools are being used as recruiting grounds. Applications are accepted age 15 and a half, and military training can start at 16, either at Harrogate Army Foundation college, or Welbeck Defence sixth-form college. The UK is the only EU country to permit 16-year-olds to enlist and start military training. According to Child Soldiers International (CSI), only 17 other countries allow it, including Zambia, El Salvador and Iran. In June, the UN committee on the rights of the child told the UK government to “reconsider its active policy of recruitment of children into the armed forces and ensure that recruitment practices do not actively target persons under the age of 18 and ensure that military recruiters’ access to schools be strictly limited”. And an open letter sent in May to the then armed forces minister, Penny Mordaunt, signed by children’s and human rights organisations, teaching unions and the Welsh, Scottish and Northern Irish children’s commissioners (though not the children’s commissioner for England) pointed out that three-quarters of the British public would like to see all-adult armed forces. Most states worldwide, the letter states, enlist into the armed forces only from the age of 18. The military says it goes into schools only when invited, its sessions are agreed in advance and its activities in the classroom are not about recruitment. “It’s about engaging with society and society better understanding us. It’s about us having a relationship with the society we represent,” says Colonel Simon Stockley, whose role as head of army recruitment encompasses schools and community outreach. “There’s been so much in the media over the past years in terms of what the army does in places like Afghanistan, and yet our job is also to show that the army’s role goes much further. There is so much more to service than just combat.” At ForcesWatch , which monitors the military’s presence in schools, coordinator Emma Sangster is sceptical. “Recruitment is a process, it’s not a single event,” she says. Over time, these visits market a lifestyle of opportunity and thrills, and “drip feed things of interest to children of school age”. This seems to be backed up by the military’s own materials. A 2011 report, in a section titled Overview of Current Defence Youth Activity, states that “servicemen and women engage young people in schools through presentations, discussions, problem solving and personal development activity … This engagement is primarily focused on recruitment, and each service also runs short military familiarisation courses to introduce selected young people to service life.” In a table in the same document, “development activity in schools” is directly linked to recruitment outcomes. “This ‘taster’ activity is a more sensitive way of introducing service life and encouraging a predisposition to serve,” it says. ForcesWatch has particular concerns regarding the careers materials and video presentations shown to pupils. “They sanitise what conflict involves, and also glamorise it. They focus on adventure, which young people are desperate for,” says Sangster. A new video presentation, not shown to the Marlborough pupils on the day I visit, but which I watch in the library later, confirms her point. The overwhelming impression is of a fast-paced, thrilling lifestyle filled with skiing, skydiving, kayaking, rock-climbing and scuba diving, and it shows groups of off-duty soldiers socialising on a posting to Cyprus. Interspersed with the action-packed footage of young people having a blast is a whiz through different roles in the army, an occasional glimpse of tanks racing over rugged terrain and the odd gun barrel shooting a round into a clear blue sky. It looks like an advert for the best adventure holiday ever, with an added frisson provided by the hardware. And, says Rachel Taylor, programme manager at CSI, the risks children bear in the forces may be greater than if they were to enlist later. A study by CSI and ForcesWatch showed that those who joined at 16 were twice as likely to be killed in Afghanistan as those who joined at 18 or older – despite not being deployed until age 18. “This is because they’re channelled into the most dangerous roles when they’re recruited,” says Taylor. “So, although the Ministry of Defence always says ‘it’s not dangerous to join at 16 because you aren’t deployed until you’re 18’, our response is ‘it’s your age when you enlist that determines the degree of risk you face over your whole career’.” At the Association of School and College Leaders, director of policy Leora Cruddas says: “We would not expect visits from the armed forces for recruitment purposes.” Annie Thomson, headteacher at Marlborough science academy, has never felt that the military’s sessions at her school pushed a recruitment message. They are invited in, along with representatives from other sectors, she says, “to open up students to the idea that there is a whole range of ways to go forward”. Issues relating to conflict are examined in a cross-curricular philosophy and ethics programme, she says. There is a cadet force at the school, and Thomson is keen for children to explore their prospects beyond a narrowly academic framework. “If we had a group of students who were interested in pursuing a route with the army, we’d support them through that process,” she says. There have been, she says, “quite a few” already. Young people in the armed forces can benefit from career training opportunities they might be pressed to find elsewhere, Stockley says. They are “often young people who, for whatever reason, have not succeeded in traditional education, and [by joining up] they have transformed their lives”, he says. But there is an ethical question here, says Sangster, if the military is targeting schools in poorer areas, where children may have less good educational outcomes. “Is it acceptable that students from those areas, who’ve not been served well by the education system, should be targeted for a uniquely risky career?” she asks. There is also a military exemption on minimum standards for training, she notes, which means that children who join up at 16 spend two years in college without any guarantees on the quality of their academic or vocational learning experience. There are moves to examine more carefully the messages given out by the military in educational settings. The Welsh government recently agreed to recommendations for more scrutiny and guidance of armed forces visits to schools, and the Scottish government is considering similar proposals. The Educational Institute for Scotland, the largest teaching union in Scotland, opposes unfettered access to schools by the military for recruitment purposes and the National Union of Teachers in England and Wales is opposed to military recruitment activities in schools that use “misleading propaganda”. The military has enjoyed high visibility in schools in recent years, with millions of pounds spent on expanding the cadets, the Troops to Teachers initiative , and a teaching resource [pdf] about the military promoted by the Department for Education that sparked criticism from the Quakers, among others. Back at Marlborough science academy, there’s no doubting that pupils have enjoyed their session with the army. “It’s a lot about leadership, and yes, it’s something I’d want to do when I’m older,” says Ky Hussain, 14. Standing beside him, Libby says what struck her most is the community and friendship that life in the army fosters. “I liked that,” she says. “I would go for it,” says Lillie, “but at the same time, I’d have to think about it because I’d be scared.”"
"Keep fossil fuels in the ground to stop climate change","In the fourth piece in the Guardian’s major series on climate change , George Monbiot argues that once coal, oil and gas are produced, they will be used. And yet, after 23 years of UN negotiations there have been almost no steps taken to stop the production – rather than the use of – fossil fuels You can read previous pieces here  Tue 10 Mar 2015 12.00 GMT   Last modified on Wed 14 Feb 2018 18.36 GMT   If you visit the website of the UN body that oversees the world’s climate negotiations , you will find dozens of pictures, taken across 20 years, of people  clapping . These photos should be of interest to anthropologists and psychologists. For they show hundreds of intelligent, educated, well-paid and elegantly-dressed people wasting their lives. The celebratory nature of the images testifies to the world of make-believe these people inhabit. They are surrounded by objectives, principles, commitments, instruments and protocols, which create a reassuring phantasm of progress while the ship on which they travel slowly founders. Leafing through these photos, I imagine I can almost hear what the delegates are saying through their expensive dentistry. “Darling you’ve re-arranged the deckchairs beautifully. It’s a breakthrough! We’ll have to invent a mechanism for holding them in place, as the deck has developed a bit of a tilt, but we’ll do that at the next conference.” This process is futile because they have addressed the problem only from one end, and it happens to be the wrong end. They have sought to prevent climate breakdown by limiting the amount of greenhouse gases that are released; in other words, by constraining the consumption of fossil fuels. But, throughout the 23 years since the world’s governments decided to begin this process, the delegates have uttered not one coherent word about constraining production. Compare this to any other treaty-making process. Imagine, for example, that the Biological Weapons Convention made no attempt to restrain the production or possession of weaponised smallpox and anthrax, but only to prohibit their use. How effective do you reckon it would be? (You don’t have to guess: look at the US gun laws, which prohibit the lethal use of guns but not their sale and carriage. You can see the results on the news every week.) Imagine trying to protect elephants and rhinos only by banning the purchase of their tusks and horns, without limiting killing, export or sale. Imagine trying to bring slavery to an end not by stopping the transatlantic trade, but by seeking only to discourage people from buying slaves once they had arrived in the Americas. If you want to discourage a harmful trade, you must address it at both ends: production and consumption. Of the two, production is the most important. The extraction of fossil fuels is a hard fact. The rules governments have developed to prevent their use are weak, inconsistent and negotiable. In other words, when coal, oil and gas are produced, they will be used. Continued production will overwhelm attempts to restrict consumption. Even if efforts to restrict consumption temporarily succeed, they are likely to be self-defeating. A reduction in demand when supply is unconstrained lowers the price, favouring carbon-intensive industry. You can search through the UN’s website for any recognition of this issue, but you would be wasting your time. In its gushing catalogue of self-congratulation, at Kyoto, Doha, Bali, Copenhagen, Cancún, Durban, Lima and all stops en route, the phrase “fossil fuel” does not occur once. Nor do the words coal or oil. But gas: oh yes, there are plenty of mentions of gas. Not natural gas, of course, but of greenhouse gases, the sole topic of official interest. The closest any of the 20 international conferences convened so far have come to acknowledging the problem is in the resolution adopted in Lima in December last year. It pledged “cooperation” in “the phasing down of high-carbon investments and fossil fuel subsidies”, but proposed no budget, timetable or any instrument or mechanism required to make it happen. It’s progress of a sort, I suppose, and perhaps, after just 23 years, we should be grateful. There is nothing random about the pattern of silence that surrounds our lives. Silences occur where powerful interests are at risk of exposure. They protect these interests from democratic scrutiny. I’m not suggesting that the negotiators decided not to talk about fossil fuels, or signed a common accord to waste their lives. Far from it: they have gone to great lengths to invest their efforts with the appearance of meaning and purpose. Creating a silence requires only an instinct for avoiding conflict. It is a conditioned and unconscious reflex; part of the package of social skills that secures our survival. Don’t name the Devil for fear that you’ll summon him. Breaking such silences requires a conscious and painful effort. I remember as if it were yesterday how I felt when I first raised this issue in the media . I had been working with a group of young activists in Wales, campaigning against opencast coal mines . Talking it over with them, it seemed so obvious, so overwhelming, that I couldn’t understand why it wasn’t on everyone’s lips. Before writing about it, I circled the topic like a dog investigating a suspicious carcass. Why, I wondered, is no one touching this? Is it toxic? You cannot solve a problem without naming it. The absence of official recognition of the role of fossil fuel production in causing climate change – blitheringly obvious as it is – permits governments to pursue directly contradictory policies. While almost all governments claim to support the aim of preventing more than 2C of global warming, they also seek to “maximise economic recovery” of their fossil fuel reserves. (Then they cross their fingers, walk three times widdershins around the office and pray that no one burns it.) But few governments go as far as the UK has gone. In the Infrastructure Act that received royal assent last month, maximising the economic recovery of petroleum from the UK’s continental shelf became a statutory duty. Future governments are now l egally bound to squeeze every possible drop out of the ground . The idea came from a government review conducted by Sir Ian Wood , the billionaire owner of an inherited company – the Wood Group – that provides services to the oil and gas industry. While Sir Ian says his recommendations “ received overwhelming industry support ”, his team interviewed no one outside either the oil business or government. It contains no sign that I can detect of any feedback from environment groups or scientists. His review demanded government powers to enhance both the exploration of new reserves and the exploitation of existing ones. This, it insisted, “will help take us closer to the 24bn [barrel] prize potentially still to come”. The government promised to implement his recommendations in full and without delay . In fact it went some way beyond them. It is prepared to be ruthlessly interventionist when promoting climate change, but not when restraining it. During December’s climate talks in Lima , the UK’s energy secretary, Ed Davey, did something unwise. He broke the silence. He warned that if climate change policies meant that fossil fuel reserves could no longer be exploited, pension funds could be investing in “ the sub-prime assets of the future ”. Echoing the Bank of England and financial analysts such as the Carbon Tracker Initiative , Davey suggested that if governments were serious about preventing climate breakdown, fossil fuel could become a stranded asset . This provoked a furious response from the industry. The head of Oil and Gas UK Malcolm Webb wrote to express his confusion , pointing out that Davey’s statements came “at a time when you, your Department and the Treasury are putting great effort into [making] the UK North Sea more attractive to investors in oil and gas, not less. I’m intrigued to understand how such opposing viewpoints can be reconciled.” He’s not the only one. Ed Davey quickly explained that his comments were not to be taken seriously, as “I did not offer any suggestions on what investors should choose to do.” Barack Obama has the same problem. During a television interview last year, he confessed that “ We’re not going to be able to burn it all .” So why, he was asked, has his government been encouraging ever more exploration and extraction of fossil fuels? His administration has opened up marine oil exploration from Florida to Delaware – in waters that were formally off-limits . It has increased the number of leases sold for drilling on federal lands and, most incongruously, rushed through the process that might, by the end of this month, enable Shell to prospect in the highly vulnerable Arctic waters of the Chukchi Sea . Similar contradictions beset most governments with environmental pretensions. Norway, for example, intends to be “carbon neutral” by 2030. Perhaps it hopes to export its entire oil and gas output, while relying on wind farms at home . A motion put to the Norwegian parliament last year to halt new drilling because it is incompatible with Norway’s climate change policies was defeated by 95 votes to three. Obama explained that “I don’t always lead with the climate change issue because if you, right now, are worried about whether you’ve got a job or if you can pay the bills, the first thing you want to hear is how do I meet the immediate problem?” Money is certainly a problem, but not necessarily for the reasons Obama suggested. The bigger issue is the bankrolling of politics by big oil and big coal , and the tremendous lobbying power they purchase. These companies have, in the past, financed wars to protect their position ; they will not surrender the bulk of their reserves without a monumental fight. This fight would test the very limits of state power; I wonder whether our nominal democracies would survive it. Fossil fuel companies have become glutted on silence: their power has grown as a result of numberless failures to challenge and expose them. It’s no wonder that the manicured negotiators at the UN conferences, so careful never to break a nail, have spent so long avoiding the issue. I believe there are ways of resolving this problem, ways that might recruit other powerful interests against these corporations. For example, a global auction in pollution permits would mean that governments had to regulate just a few thousand oil refineries, coal washeries, gas pipelines and cement and fertiliser factories, rather than the activities of seven billion people . It would create a fund from the sale of permits that’s likely to run into trillions: money that could be used for anything from renewable energy to healthcare. By reducing fluctuations in the supply of energy, it would deliver more predictable prices, that many businesses would welcome. Most importantly, unlike the current framework for negotiations, it could work, producing a real possibility of averting climate breakdown. Left to themselves, the negotiators will continue to avoid this issue until they have wasted everyone else’s lives as well as their own. They keep telling us that the conference in Paris in December is the make or break meeting (presumably they intend to unveil a radical new deckchair design). We should take them at their word, and demand that they start confronting the real problem. With the help of George Marshall at the Climate Outreach and Information Network , I’ve drafted a paragraph of the kind that the Paris agreement should contain. It’s far from perfect, and I would love to see other people refining it. But, I hope, it’s a start: “Scientific assessments of the carbon contained in existing fossil fuel reserves suggest that full exploitation of these reserves is incompatible with the agreed target of no more than 2C of global warming. The unrestricted extraction of these reserves undermines attempts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. We will start negotiating a global budget for the extraction of fossil fuels from existing reserves, as well as a date for a moratorium on the exploration and development of new reserves. In line with the quantification of the fossil carbon that can be extracted without a high chance of exceeding 2C of global warming, we will develop a timetable for annual reductions towards that budget. We will develop mechanisms for allocating production within this budget and for enforcement and monitoring.” If something of that kind were to emerge from Paris, it will not have been a total waste of time, and the delegates would be able to congratulate themselves on a real achievement rather than yet another false one. Then, for once, they would deserve their own applause."
"The EU’s plan for an energy union would call Vladimir Putin’s bluff","Contact author  Fri 27 Feb 2015 06.30 GMT   Last modified on Thu 21 Feb 2019 14.18 GMT   H ow many of us, as European citizens, turn on the gas to cook something and reflect that we are part of an enormous geopolitical and environmental picture? But we are. Europe’s energy dilemmas go back to the 1970s and 80s, when decisions were made to build huge gas infrastructure networks connecting the west of the continent to the Soviet Union’s gas fields. At the time, US presidents Jimmy Carter and then Ronald Reagan expressed worries that such plans would place European allies under Moscow’s sway. Fast forward to 2015 and the Ukrainian crisis: the latest message on Europe’s need to find smart ways to use energy and wean itself off its dependency on Russia’s Gazprom has just come from the European commission, with a new policy paper outlining ambitions for a European energy union . One of the reasons Europe has been so ineffective in dealing with Vladimir Putin is that it never quite anticipated to what degree he would use the energy card to further Russia’s nationalist goals. The question is: can Europe get it right now? It’s easy to understand why the proponents of an EU energy union would use slightly grandiose language to sell their ideas. They have cast this plan as the “most ambitious European energy project since the Coal and Steel Community” of the 1950s. After all, energy solidarity is what Europe was all about at the start. Having France and Germany share their coal and steel was seen, in the words of Robert Schuman, one of the founders of the European project, as the best way to “make war not only unthinkable but materially impossible”. Peace and prosperity were to flow from regional integration. Last year, war broke out in the country (Ukraine) through which most of Russia’s energy exports transit on their way to many of our homes . A key feature of Putin’s Ukraine strategy has been to make sure this country of transit would never quite escape Moscow’s domination – and that Gazprom would never lose the possibility of directly controlling Ukraine’s gas pipelines to Europe. The Brussels commission is right to push for a new union. Energy should be, along with freedom of movement for people, goods and services, a key dimension of the EU. It would help in dealing with Russia’s behaviour as well as in tackling climate change. It is of huge strategic importance. Yet it has not happened – so far – because it is so difficult to build politically, and it will be expensive. Energy is run nationally – not at EU level – at present. Key countries, especially the UK, France and Germany, have their own views on how energy policy should be run, and they are all different. The UK has a deregulated market, many private players, and no dependency on Gazprom. France is highly centralised, with a handful of , state-controlled big players and 75% of electricity generated by nuclear power (which is anathema to the Germans). Germany dislikes nuclear energy and wants to get rid of it, preferring to burn coal if they run out of gas or renewables. And they have had historically good relations with Gazprom . Poland burns a lot of coal (it prefers that to Russian gas), but Poles also want to look for shale gas. They don’t worry that much about greenhouse gases. The list goes on. There is a disorderly patchwork of energy policies across Europe. But questions that have been important for years need to be re-addressed. It is too late to settle scores over who wrecked Europe’s previous chances of setting up a common energy policy. But Germany does have a special responsibility here. Its large and powerful energy companies, E.ON and RWE, were the first in the early 2000s to carve out long-term contracts with Gazprom without much consultation with European partners. Later, Germany unilaterally signed up to Russia’s North Stream pipeline which the Baltic states and Poland could only perceive as an attempt to pressure them geopolitically. The new EU plan doesn’t aim to dismantle such realities but is pragmatic enough to try to deal with some of Europe’s obvious weaknesses. Because energy has been mostly a domestic issue there are very few, interconnecting pipelines and grids. The plan is to build more. This would allow compensation for energy cut offs – such as the ones that Russia created in 2006 and 2009, causing thousands of eastern European homes to be left without heating for weeks. Another idea is to diversify energy supplies by working on a southern gas corridor linking Europe to Turkey and Central Asia, or by setting up liquified natural gas hubs in northern Europe that could act as back-up in case of another gas crisis with Russia. The complexities are numerous. Some energy business insiders point out that negotiating with a Central Asian country such as Turkmenistan is like landing on another planet. One told me about a meeting with 30 Turkmen government officials sitting immobile behind long tables in the Hall of the Peoples of Turkmenistan’s capital, who didn’t say a word but just stared. Turkmenistan is a big gas producer whose operatives have been known to sell the same quantity of gas several times over to various buyers (Russians, Chinese, etc). The story that gets less attention than Ukraine’s military plight – or how Russia is yet again trying to strong arm it over gas payments – is that Gazprom is now clearly viewed as a security threat by just about everyone in Europe, including the Germans. For a few years now Gazprom has been getting a hard time from the EU, with antitrust proceedings on contracts and pricing clauses, dawn raids on their European offices and permits for some of their projects refused. A special anti-Gazprom clause was even included in a 2009 EU regulatory package that requires “unbundling” for the electricity and natural gas industry. Gazprom, say some experts (perhaps optimistically), has few friends left in Europe – except maybe in Viktor Orban’s Hungary, but they won’t count much in the big picture. If it negotiates as one bloc, Europe will not only be strategically stronger, but also in a better position to set an example on fulfilling its climate goals. The best way, for example, to encourage Poland to cut down on its use of coal is to ensure that its gas needs will not be subjected to external blackmailing. After all the criticism that has been aimed at EU institutions, the latest plan from Brussels deserves support."
"Syria crisis: Ban Ki-moon says sarin gas chemical attack a 'war crime' - as it happened","Matthew Weaver and  Tom McCarthy  Mon 16 Sep 2013 23.00 BST    First published on Mon 16 Sep 2013 08.40 BST     10.59pm BST  We're going to wrap up our live blog coverage for the day. Here's a summary of where things stand: • The US, UK and France said a UN report showed the Assad regime was responsible for a sarin nerve gas attack east of Damascus last month.  Russia said the Western powers had "jumped to conclusions." • The UN said it had "indisputable" evidence that sarin was used in the attack. A UN report described rockets, trajectories and launch systems that analysts said implicated the Assad regime. "The facts speak for themselves," UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon said. • It was unclear whether an initial UN resolution on Syria's chemical weapons would be backed by a use of force. A deal over the weekend between Russia and the US called for "measures under Chapter VII" to be imposed in case of noncompliance. But the UN security council may pass a nonbinding resolution first. • "There's a lot of different ways this can play out at the UN in terms of language," a state department spokeswoman said . US leaders have insisted on an allowance for force. Russia has resisted. • Syria accused Turkey of being "hasty" in shooting down a Syrian helicopter that Turkey said crossed its border Wednesday, according to a state media report. Video of the crash has emerged. Turkey said it would explain further what happened to the UN and NATO. • The number of Syrian refugees crossing into Jordan jumped nearly tenfold last week to an average 900 people per day, the Associated Press report ed. The refugee flow is at its highest level in months, Jordanian officials said. However many Syrians were returning home as well, if only temporarily. Updated at 11.00pm BST  10.39pm BST  Damascus has accused Turkey of being "hasty" in shooting down a helicopter Monday and of trying to escalate tensions, according to a state media report quoted by Reuters.  10.36pm BST  Russia argued that the Western powers had "jumped to conclusions" with their declaration that today's UN report established the Assad regime's culpability in last month's chemical attack, Guardian diplomatic editor Julian Borger reports: Russia said claims of rebel use against their own supporters to provoke foreign intervention "should not be shrugged off". There was also sharp disagreement about what kind of UN resolution was needed to implement the agreement struck by the US and Russia on Saturday in Geneva on dismantling the Assad regime's chemical weapons programme. The differences – on whether an initial resolution should include the threat of punitive measures for Syrian non-compliance – were a reminder that the Geneva agreement could still unravel before it is put into force. Read the full piece here.   10.21pm BST  The Associated Press publishes a montage of video of the downing of a Syrian helicopter Monday by Turkish warplanes. The craft falls from the sky in a ball of flames trailing black smoke. The men filming the videos speak today's date to establish authenticity. Earlier we linked to Brown Moses' roundup of videos of the crash and aftermath. The Turkish foreign minister has said Istanbul will report to NATO and the UN on the circumstances surrounding the altercation. Video (warning: graphic)  has surfaced of a dead man said to be a pilot. (h/t: @ erinmcunningham ) Updated at 10.25pm BST  9.44pm BST  President Barack Obama is clearing the way for the U.S. to send non-lethal assistance to the Syrian opposition to help them prevent the use or proliferation of chemical weapons, the AP reports: The president's authorization also allows the U.S. to send chemical weapons-related personal protective equipment to international organizations working in Syria. It also allows for the transfer of assistance to local health care providers in Syria to help them treat victims of chemical weapons attacks. A senior administration official says the U.S. had already started making plans to send the assistance before a chemical weapons attack in Syria on Aug. 21. The official was not authorized to publicly discuss the aid by name and insisted on anonymity. statement from the NSC on Obama's #Syria determination, just released by WH pic.twitter.com/716PF30eWL  9.04pm BST  Iran has lifted – temporarily? – restrictions on tweeting and Facebook. Here's the New York Times correspondent: Okay people the rumors are true, this is my first tweet ever using Iran's state cell phone internet service without VPN!!! Both twitter and FB have been filtered since 2009 protests. For years Iranians had to use special software for access. Also in Iran news from the last 48 hours : a positive response by president Hassan Rouhani to a letter from president Obama could lead to the first face-to-face meeting between the US and Iranian presidents since 1979; Iran's new atomic energy chief has pledged greater cooperation with the UN nuclear watchdog; and Rouhani has delivered a "carefully worded" speech inviting the elite revolutionary guard to stay out of politics.  8.52pm BST  The main reform bloc in Syria welcomed reports of a US-Russian deal on chemical weapons but said it should quickly lead to a ceasefire and transition talks , reports the Guardian's Jonathan Steele from Damascus: “The withdrawal of Syria’s chemical weapons is only one issue. The main agenda must be a comprehensive political solution negotiated at Geneva”, Rajaa Nasser, the general secretary of the National Coordination Body for Democratic Change, told the Guardian Sunday. The group is an umbrella for some 20 parties and organisations, a few in exile but most in Damascus. Many have spent years in Syrian prisons. Nasser described the claim by Ali Haidar, the minister of national reconciliation, that the chemical weapons treaty was a victory for Syria as “a joke”. “It is definitely not a victory”, Nasser declared. As for the Syrian National Coalition, the rebel group which is backed by Western governments and has so far refused to attend the planned conference in Geneva, he said, “We don’t take their objections seriously. The SNC is not independent. If the United States wants Geneva to take place, the SNC will have to agree”. [...] As long-standing Arab nationalists and critics of Israeli policies, the NCB believes that Syria’s chemical weapons should be restored to any new government that emerges after the civil war, Jonathan reports: “We want to expand the chemical weapons treaty to the whole Middle East and balance it against Israel’s weapons of mass destruction," Nasser said. "Now Syria has lost that balance”.  8.28pm BST  Here's a summary of where things stand: • The US, UK and France said a UN report presenting "indisputable" evidence of a sarin nerve gas attack in Syria also established the culpability of the Assad regime. The UN report did not name a culprit but included details of the rockets and launching systems used – as well as the gas used – in the 21 August attack. • "This is a war crime, and grave violation," UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon said. "This is the most significant use of chemical weapons against civilians" since Saddam Hussein used them in Halabja in 1988, he said. • Debate continued over whether the weekend Geneva deal between the US and Russia provided for military action to back up demands that Syria destroy chemical weapons. The deal mentions "measures" under Chapter VII but it's unclear whether those measures would be imposed under an initial UN resolution currently in draft. • Negotiations on a resolution continued at UN headquarters in New York. "There's a lot of different ways this can play out at the UN in terms of language," a state department spokeswoman said . "...Obviously our goal is to have the strongest enforcement possible." •  Turkish foreign minister Ahmet Davutoglu said he would inform the United Nations and NATO members of the circumstances of the downing of a Syrian helicopter Monday by Turkish forces . Turkey said the helicopter crossed into Turkish territory. Updated at 8.32pm BST  7.48pm BST  War crimes blamed on the Syrian opposition are predominantly being carried out by foreign fighters , a U.N. human rights investigator said on Monday. Reuters reports : "If you're going to look for the (opposition) groups that are committing the worst crimes, look particularly for the foreign fighters, where the foreign fighters are fighting," Karen Koning Abuzayd told reporters in Geneva.[...] Abuzayd is one of the four lead members of the U.N. Commission of Inquiry on Syria, a body set up by the U.N. Human Rights Council two years ago to investigate war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Syrian conflict. [...] Paulo Pinheiro, chairman of the U.N. Commission of Inquiry on Syria, said there were now foreign fighters from about 20 countries in Syria including some from Europe. Read the full report here .  7.46pm BST  U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry will host China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi at a meeting and working lunch on Thursday at which Syria and North Korea will be discussed, the State Department said on Monday. Reuters reports: "While this meeting has been planned for some time, we do expect the secretary and foreign minister to discuss current issues, such as the DPRK (North Korea) and Syria," spokeswoman Marie Harf told a regular news briefing. China has welcomed a deal reached by the United States and Russia to eliminate Syria's chemical weapons arsenal.  7.45pm BST  American, British and French diplomats have been quick to say that the UN report delivered to the security council today conclusively establishes the culpability of the Assad regime in the 21 August chemical attack. British Ambassador Mark Lyall Grant told reporters there was "no remaining doubt that it was the regime" that was responsible for the attack, Reuters reports. U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power echoed his remarks, as did French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius. "When you look at the findings carefully, the quantities of toxic gas used, the complexity of the mixes, the nature and the trajectory of the (gas) carriers, it leaves absolutely no doubt as to the origin of the attack," Fabius told RTL radio Monday evening. "...It reinforces the position of those that have said the regime is guilty." Here's @Brown_Moses 's detailed post about the munitions used in CW attack, if you still doubt Assad did it: http://t.co/Cpy9IvISV8  #Syria  7.15pm BST  US ambassador to the UN Samantha Power says the United States "will impose measures under Chapter VII" in the case of noncompliance by Syria in dismantling its chemical weapons program. It's worth noting that the US could not impose such measures without the assent of security council member Russia. The Assad regime was clearly behind the 21 August chemical attack, Power says. UN evidence show the rockets came from regime-controlled areas; it does not make sense that rebels would have infiltrated those areas only to fire on their own territory, she says. Power urges the security council to "take the kind of credible, binding action warranted." Building on today's findings, we think it's very important for countries... to speak, and make public their conclusions. ... Our impression again is that the technical details will lend themselves to an even more unmistakable conclusion. It is critical that Assad would be losing his chemical weapons program.  7.06pm BST  Question for the state department: Why would Assad fear US strikes? Don't you think the Syrian regime has seen that the Congress won't agree to strikes and the American people don't support war? Harf replies: "I think they should listen to the words of the commander-in-chief, who makes these decisions."  7.05pm BST  "We believe the opposition is becoming more coherent," Marie Harf, the US state department spokeswoman, says. "The election of the prime minister speaks to that." The Istanbul-based Syrian National Coalition chose moderate Islamist Ahmad Tumeh as opposition prime minister at the weekend. Harf rejects the notion, backed by wide reporting, that the opposition inside and outside Syria is exasperated with the United States for the failure of military strikes to materialize. "We work very closely with the opposition on a daily basis," Harf says. "I'm not going to speak for the opposition. "If there's no [regime] compliance [on dismantling chemical weapons]... the threat of military indeed is still very much on the table."  6.50pm BST  Ban deflects a question about who was responsible for the sarin attack: It is for others to decide whether to pursue this matter further to determine responsibility. It was a grave crime and those responsible must be brought to justice as soon as possible. Ban says he's asked the chemical weapons inspectors to return to Syria "as soon as we have an agreement with the Syrian government."  6.48pm BST  State department deputy spokesperson Marie Harf is trying to explain the conflicting Russian and US statements on whether the deal signed in Geneva included support for a potential use of force. "We and the Russians agreed to a text... that clearly states that Chapter VII needs to be part of a security council process." Harf says. That is true; the text of the "Framework for the Elimination of Syria Chemical Weapons is here . The pertinent bit is paragraph four: The United States and the Russian Federation concur that this UN Security Council resolution should provide for review on a regular basis the implementation in Syria of the decision of the Executive Council of the OPCW, and in the event of non-compliance, including unauthorized transfer, or any use of chemical weapons by anyone in Syria, the UN Security Council should impose measures under Chapter VII of the UN Charter. However it's unclear whether the UN resolution currently being drafted – Harf says the work is continuing at UN headquarters – falls under Chapter VII, or whether there will be an initial nonbinding resolution, potentially to be followed later by a binding resolution if the Syrian regime is found to be in noncompliance. "There's a lot of different ways this can play out at the UN in terms of language," Harf says. "... obviously our goal is to have the strongest enforcement possible."  6.45pm BST  Ban begins his statement at the UN: "This is a war crime, and grave violation," Ban says. "This is the most significant use of chemical weapons against civilians" since Saddam Hussein used them in Halabja in 1988, he says. Updated at 7.15pm BST  6.21pm BST  Turkey's deputy prime minister has confirmed that Turkish warplanes shot down a Syrian helicopter on Monday. Deputy PM Bulent Arinc said the helicopter was shot down after it violated Turkish airspace, Reuters reports: “[Monday] at 1420 (1120 GMT) an Mi-17 helicopter belonging to Syria violated the Turkish border in the Guvecci area of Yayladagi in Hatay province by 2 km,” Arinc told reporters in Ankara after a regular cabinet meeting. “It was repeatedly warned by our air defence elements. When the violation continued, our planes ... hit the helicopter at 1425 with a missile causing it to fall on Syrian soil.”  6.14pm BST  Turkish foreign minister Ahmet Davutoglu will inform the United Nations and NATO members of the circumstances of the downing of a Syrian helicopter by Turkish forces, Reuters reports.  6.10pm BST  The price of oil fell to near $107 a barrel Monday on waning fears of a wider Middle East conflict thanks to an international deal intended to halt the use of chemical weapons in Syria. The benchmark oil contract for October delivery fell $1.11 to $107.10 a barrel in midday trading in New York. The contract for November delivery for Brent crude, the benchmark for international crudes used by many U.S. refineries, fell $1.60 to $110.10 a barrel in London.  6.06pm BST  UN staff has just announced that Ban is still meeting with security council members, and so his planned 12.50pm ET news conference is "running a little bit late." We're going to monitor the US state department daily briefing, also scheduled to start shortly, and the White House daily briefing set for 1.30 pm ET.  5.53pm BST  Ban's address at the United Nations will be carried live by C-SPAN here.  5.52pm BST  UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon is scheduled to address reporters shortly. Here's a summary of where things stand: • Ban said UN investigators had found "overwhelming and indisputable" evidence that the nerve agent sarin was used in the east Ghouta attacks of 21 August. "The facts speak for themselves," Ban said in a statement. • Eighty-five per cent of the blood samples tested positive for sarin, the UN report found, according to Ban. "A majority of the rockets or rocket fragments recovered were found to be carrying sarin." • In its report on the chemical attack, the UN identified the surface-to-surface rockets used, their launching systems and their trajectories. Ban did not mention the Assad regime by name but the findings implicated forces linked to Assad. •  The Geneva deal between the US and Russia on dismantling Assad's chemical weapons program provides for "measures under Chapter VII of the UN charter" in the event of noncompliance, according to text of the agreement quoted by Ban. Chapter VII provides for "action by air, sea, or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security." •  Turkey said it shot down a Syrian helicopter that had crossed its border, according to AFP and local reports. Footage of a downed craft said to be outside Latakia emerged on social media Monday. •  Jabhat al-Nusra, the al-Qaeda-linked opposition group, says it killed at least 30 members of the Alawite sect during an attack on three villages in central Syria last week, the AP reported. • The number of Syrian refugees crossing into Jordan jumped nearly tenfold last week to an average 900 people per day, the Associated Press report ed. The refugee flow is at its highest level in months, Jordanian officials said. Updated at 5.59pm BST  5.31pm BST  The Geneva agreement between the US and Russia includes a clause that provides for the use of force in case of noncompliance, U N secretary-general Ban Ki-moon says in a statement today upon the release of a report by UN chemical weapons inspectors. Ban quotes from what he says is the Geneva agreement: The unity of the Security Council will be crucial. Given the gravity of the situation, I urge the Council to consider ways to ensure enforcement of, and compliance with, the plan through a clear resolution. In that regard, I draw your attention to a significant element in the agreement reached in Geneva, and I quote: "The United States and the Russian Federation concur that this UN Security Council resolution should provide for review on a regular basis the implementation in Syria of the decision of the Executive Council of the OPCW, and in the event of non-compliance, including unauthorized transfer, or any use of chemical weapons by anyone in Syria, the UN Security Council should impose measures under Chapter VII of the UN Charter." End quote. I agree there should be consequences for non-compliance. Any use of chemical weapons by anyone, anywhere, is a crime. Ban's full statement is here.  5.26pm BST  The Ban statement on the UN investigation's findings is crafted with unequivocal, strong language : The results are overwhelming and indisputable. The facts speak for themselves. The United Nations Mission has now confirmed, unequivocally and objectively, that chemical weapons have been used in Syria. Updated at 5.52pm BST  5.24pm BST  The UN report on chemical weapons use in Syria includes details identifying rockets used and their trajectories , Guardian diplomatic editor Julian Borger reports. The UN report names three areas where surface-to-surface rockets containing the nerve agent sarin were used: Ein Tarma, Moadamiyah and Zalmalka in the Ghouta area of Damascus. Julian writes: The report has detailed pictures and descriptions of the rockets apparently used in the attack. The letters engraved on the bottom ring of the engine of one of the rockets highlighted were Cyrillic. "The rockets are believed to have arrived from the northwest", the report says. Munition used in Moadamiyah "matches one of the variants of the M14 artillery rocket, with either an original or improvised warhead. The dispersion pattern commonly associated with rockets luanched from a single, multi-barrel, launcher. In Ein Tarma: "The munition related to this impact site by observed and measured characteristics indicatively matches a 33 mm caliber, artillery rocket." It came on an east/Southeast trajectory.  5.12pm BST  Four key factual findings from Ban's report, including " Eighty-five per cent of the blood samples tested positive for sarin": The samples were sent for analysis to four laboratories designated by the OPCW. The Mission’s factual findings are as follows. (a)The environmental and biomedical samples demonstrate the widespread nature of the attacks. Eighty-five per cent of the blood samples tested positive for sarin. Biomedical samples were taken from 34 of the 36 patients selected by the Mission who had signs of poisoning. Almost all tested positive for exposure to sarin. (b)These results were corroborated by the clinical assessments, which documented symptoms and signs consistent with nerve agent exposure. A number of affected patients were diagnosed with intoxification by an organophosphorous compound, and clearly showed symptoms associated with sarin, including loss of consciousness, shortness of breath, blurred vision, eye inflammation, vomiting and seizures. (c)A majority of the environmental samples confirmed the use of sarin. The samples were taken from impact sites and surrounding areas – locations where survivors were also found to have been affected by sarin. (d)The team was also able to examine impacted and exploded surface-to-surface rockets that are capable of carrying a chemical payload. These were carefully measured, photographed and sampled. A majority of the rockets or rocket fragments recovered were found to be carrying sarin. On the basis of its analysis, the Mission concluded that it – and I quote – “collected clear and convincing evidence that surface-to-surface rockets containing the nerve agent sarin were used in the Ein Tarma, Moadamiyah and Zalmalka in the Ghouta area of Damascus.” Due to the security situation and other limitations, the Mission was unable to document the full extent of the use of chemical weapons on 21 August or to verify the total number of causalities. Read the full report here. Updated at 5.14pm BST  5.06pm BST  The UN has just released a statement by secretary-general Ban Ki-moon on its report on chemical weapons use last month in Syria. "It is with a heavy heart," Ban says , "that I submit to the Security Council the report [...] of the United Nations Missions to Investigate Allegations of the Use of Chemical Weapons on the incident that occurred on 21 August 2013 in the Ghouta area of Damascus. [...] The Mission has concluded that chemical weapons were used on a relatively large scale in the Ghouta area of Damascus in the context of the ongoing conflict in Syria. The attack resulted in numerous casualties, particularly among civilians. Updated at 5.31pm BST  5.02pm BST  Eliot Higgins, who blogs the Syrian conflict under the moniker Brown Moses, has been collecting footage today of an aircraft reportedly downed inside Syria, near Latakia, in the north – within 50 miles of the Turkish border. Brown Moses says it's not certain that this new footage, which emerged today, is connected with the incident in which Turkey said it shot down a Syrian helicopter that had violated its airspace. Here's a playlist of videos relating to the aircraft shot down in Latakia today http://t.co/43Xf6LchTR  4.56pm BST  Turkey says it has shot down a Syrian helicopter , Agence France-Presse reports. BREAKING Turkey says it has downed Syrian helicopter: deputy PM Today's Zaman, one of three Turkish English-language dailies, said the helicopter violated Turkish airspace. Turkish deputy prime minister has said its fighter jets shot down a Syrian helicopter after it violated Turkish airspace. Earlier reports said opposition fighters shot dead two pilots after they ejected themselves after their chopper was hit. [...] In response to stray bullets or shelling arriving from the Syrian side, Turkish Armed Forces have on numerous occasions returned fire since the beginning of the civil war in Syria. In 2012, Turkish artillery fired on targets in Syria after Syrian shells landed inside Turkey and killed several Turkish civilians in one instance.  4.42pm BST  Iran's new atomic energy chief has pledged greater cooperation with the UN nuclear watchdog , in advance of talks this month about activities that the West suspects are aimed at developing a nuclear weapons capability, Reuters reports: Iran said on Monday it wanted to settle a decade-old nuclear dispute with the West that has raised fears of a new Middle East war, but the United States said it must back words with action. New Iranian atomic energy chief Ali Akbar Salehi pledged greater cooperation [...] "This time we are coming with a more full-fledged ... desire for this," he said. Salehi was speaking at the annual meeting of the 159-nation International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Read the full story here . Separately Reuters reports that Iranian president Hassan Rouhani has delivered a "carefully worded" speech inviting the elite revolutionary guard to stay out of politics: Rouhani's speech, which included praise for the IRGC's increasing economic might, could be an attempt to maintain its support, something that might be in doubt if the Guards see their interests threatened by the new president who has pledged more moderation in Iran's foreign and domestic policies. A centrist cleric who won a surprise landslide victory over more conservative candidates in a June election, Rouhani told an assembly of IRGC commanders and officials that the founder of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, had recommended the military stay out of politics. "The IRGC is above and beyond political currents, not beside them or within them," Rouhani said, according to the ISNA news agency. "The IRGC has a higher status, which is that of the whole nation." Read the full report here . Updated at 9.05pm BST  4.26pm BST  Jabhat al-Nusra, the al-Qaeda-linked opposition group, says it killed at least 30 members of the Alawite sect during an attack on three villages in central Syria last week, the AP reports: Jabhat al-Nusra said in a statement posted online that its fighters attacked the predominantly Alawite villages of Maksar al-Hasan, Jab al-Jarrah and al-Massoudiyeh in Homs province on Tuesday. It said it seized Maksar al-Hasan for 10 hours before being forced to withdraw. The group says it killed more than 30 Alawites and seized 10 Russian-made weapons, ammunition, cars and other equipment in the assault. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said late Sunday that activists have confirmed the death of 22 villagers from Maksar al-Hasan. On Friday Channel 4 News and Human Rights Watch released a collaborative documentary of a massacre by regime forces in which at least 169 men, women and children were killed – many executed over hours following an exchange of gunfire – in the northwestern village of al-Bayda.  4.07pm BST  The number of Syrian refugees crossing into Jordan jumped nearly tenfold last week to an average 900 people per day, the Associated Press reports . The refugee flow is at its highest level in months, Jordanian officials said Monday: At the same time, the number of Syrians returning home has also surged, climbing to 600 per day, said Col. Zaher Abu-Shehab, who oversees refugee camps for the Jordanian government. Syrian families often move back and forth across the border multiple times as fighting ebbs and flows. Many find conditions in desert refugee camps in Jordan to be only marginally better than their battle-scarred homes. Refugee arrivals were high early this year but dwindled to an average of 100 per day in May and thereafter, Abu-Shehab told The Associated Press. He said up to date, there are 127,604 Syrian refugees living in Jordanian refugee camps, while hundreds of thousands more live in local communities. Ali Bibi, a liaison officer with the U.N. refugee agency, said the increased number of Syrian refugee arrival was due to the "security situation in southern areas bordering Jordan." Two officers with the rebel Free Syrian Army coordinating the movement of refugees between Syria and Jordan said there were additionally thousands of refugees waiting to cross into Jordan. They said the refugees moved recently from areas in the suburbs of the Syrian capital Damascus into two villages in Syria's south, namely Tal Shahab and Zeizoon, near the Jordanian frontier. "They are anxious about a potential U.S. strike on Syria and are now just across the border waiting to see how things will develop," said one of the officers, estimating their number at nearly 40,000.

Its update appears to be based on a close scrutiny of that photograph of the report being handed over that inadvertently revealed the first page of document ( see earlier ). UN inspectors said Monday there is "clear and convincing evidence" that chemical weapons were used on a relatively large scale in an attack last month in Syria that killed hundreds of people. The inspectors said "the environmental, chemical and medical samples we have collected provide clear and convincing evidence that surface-to-surface rockets containing the nerve agent sarin were used ... in the Ghouta area of Damascus" on 21 August. The report mentioned the areas of Ein Tarma, Moadamiyeh and Zamalka. "The conclusion is that chemical weapons have been used in the ongoing conflict between the parties in the Syrian Arab Republic ... against civilians, including children, on a relatively large scale," the inspectors said on the first page of their report to Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon. Ban was scheduled to present the report to the UN Security Council later Monday morning. The Associated Press saw the first page of the report. Updated at 3.20pm BST  3.04pm BST  Here's a roundup of the main developments on Syria so far today: •  A US-Russian agreement on Syria's chemical weapons showed signs of beginning to unravel over whether the Assad regime would face the threat of force if it didn't comply.  US Secretary of State John Kerry said the agreement would have no meaning unless it was backed up by a forceful UN security council resolution. "The framework fully commits the US and Russia to impose measures under chapter 7 of the UN charter in the event of non-compliance," he told a news conference in Paris. But his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, said a UN resolution based on the agreement would not initially be made under chapter 7. •  An eagerly-awaited report by UN investigators into last month's chemical attack in Syria is about to be presented to the security council.  It is expected to implicate the Assad regime in the attack. A photo of the report being submitted by the lead investigator, Åke Sellström, appeared to inadvertently reveal that it concluded sarin gas had been used. •  A group of 55 doctors and medical professionals, including three Nobel prize winners, has warned that Syria's healthcare system is "at breaking point" because of attacks on hospitals, staff being attacked, imprisoned or fleeing the country, and humanitarian organisations being denied access to patients. In an open letter to the Lancet, they say large parts of Syria are completely cut off from any form of medical assistance. •  Syria's main opposition group has rejected the Geneva chemical weapons deal claiming it will embolden the Assad regime to carry on killing civilians. The Syrian National Coalition expressed alarm at a number of crucial omissions in the agreement including the absence of any threat of force for non-compliance, and the lack of a commitment to prosecuting those who ordered chemical attacks. •  Barack Obama has raised the prospect of Iran getting involved in broader talks on Syria if Tehran recognised "that what's happening there is a train wreck that hurts not just Syrians but is destabilising the entire region". In an interview with ABC News, Obama presented the Geneva deal on Syria's chemical weapons as an opportunity to bolster diplomacy with Tehran and invited Iranian involvement in international talks about a broader settlement to the Syrian conflict, something Washington had previously resisted.  2.26pm BST  The report into last month's alleged chemical attack will be presented to the security council in the next few hours and then presented to the public by the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, the New York Times reports. The security council briefing is due to start at 11.15am EST (4.15pm BST). UN secretary general to brief Security Council on inspectors' Syria report at 11:15 am Eastern. He speaks to reporters at 12:50 pm. Updated at 3.22pm BST  1.50pm BST  The Guardian's new Moscow correspondent, Shaun Walker, has more on Russia's row with the US over what was agreed about forcing Syria to comply with the agreement on chemical weapons. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, speaking after meeting the Egyptian foreign minister in Moscow, has rejected calls for a swift UN resolution including chapter 7, and said it was made clear in Geneva that this would not happen. “If there are problems in carrying out the conditions of the agreement, if the experts are put in danger or if anyone uses chemical weapons, then the issue will be quickly looked at by the security council … and then a new resolution could be taken, which might include chapter 7. But that would be a completely different resolution.” Any resolution this week cannot include chapter 7, Lavrov insists. “I am certain that despite the statements we are hearing from certain European capitals [ see earlier ], the American side will firmly adhere to what was agreed.” Lavrov is also calling on the west to force Syrian opposition groups to attend the planned Geneva 2 conference. He says Russia is ready to start work on planning the conference immediately, and that the Syrian government has long given assurances that it would send a delegation to the conference with no conditions. “I am certain that if all external participants in the drama in Syria work to include all Syrian groupings, including the government and all opposition groups, then we will achieve a result," he said. Updated at 2.14pm BST  1.43pm BST  A UN panel investigation human rights abuses in Syria says it is looking into 14 alleged chemical attacks in Syria. The work of the Commission of Inquiry into Syria is separate from a specific UN investigation into last month's alleged attack east of Damascus, which will be published later today. The commission chairman, Paulo Pinheiro, told a news conference that the "vast majority" of casualties in Syria's civil war were from conventional weapons such as guns and mortars. He said his panel believed rebel groups had perpetrated war crimes but not crimes against humanity "because there is not a clear chain of command". Pinheiro also said Syria had invited the commission member Carla del Ponte to visit Syria in a personal capacity, but the commission wanted an official visit, including him. Del Ponte said it was assumed she had been invited because she said in May it had allegations that opposition groups had used chemical weapons. Earlier Pinheiro confirmed that his commission had found an increased in killings, crimes and other abuses by rebels, including foreign fighters invoking jihad. "Across northern Syria, there has been an upsurge in crimes and abuses committed by extremist anti-government armed groups along with an influx of rebel foreign fighters," Pinheiro told the UN's human rights council. Pinheiro also said President Bashar al-Assad's government had continued a relentless campaign of air bombardment and artillery shelling across the country. The commission published its latest report last Wednesday . Updated at 2.12pm BST  12.00pm BST  Russia has emerged from the talks in Geneva insisting there was no threat of force. Kerry disagrees. When asked today in Paris about whether military action would be threatened under chapter 7 of the UN charter, this is what he said: We are going to work hard to have a resolution that is as strong and forceful as possible. Russia did agree in Geneva that chapter 7 is mentioned specifically as the route for compliance if there is non-compliance or any use of chemical weapons by anyone in Syria. Under both of those circumstances, use of weapons or non-compliance, you are already automatically under chapter 7 according to the agreement we came out of Geneva with. So that mention is there. Update: Russia has already accused the US of misunderstanding the Geneva deal. Reuters quoted the foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, as saying that calls for a resolution under chapter 7 show a "lack of understanding". Updated at 2.10pm BST  11.39am BST  The Geneva agreement on chemical weapons is meaningless without a tough UN resolution, Kerry said. "The announcement we made in Geneva will not have meaning until this is ratified at the United Nations in the strongest most forceful terms possible, and until it is implemented and complied with by the Assad regime," he told the press conference in Paris. We will not tolerate avoidance or anything less than full compliance by the Assad regime … If Assad fails in time to abide by the terms of this framework, make no mistake, we are all agreed – and that includes Russia – that there will be consequences. The framework fully commits the US and Russia to impose measures under chapter 7 of the UN charter in the event of non-compliance … President Obama has made clear that should diplomacy fail, the military option is still on the table. Kerry insisted that the Geneva agreement should be translated into a UN resolution that "has to be strong … forceful … real … accountable … transparent … timely and enforced." He added: "If the Assad regime believes this is not enforceable and that we are not serious, they will play games." William Hague agreed, saying: "We now have to have a [UN] resolution which crystallises a binding commitment and makes sure that that is dealt with credibly reliable and promptly." Updated at 12.08pm BST  11.12am BST  John Kerry warned the Assad regime of "consequences" if it reneged on the terms of the Geneva deal to hand over its chemical weapons. Speaking at a press conference in Paris alongside his French and British counterparts, Kerry said: "We will not tolerate any avoidance." Kerry said the UN resolution should be as forceful as possible. William Hague called for a "binding" UN resolution that involved the "full weight of the UN". Updated at 11.43am BST  10.30am BST  France, Britain and the United States have agree to seek a "strong and robust" UN resolution that sets precise and binding deadlines on removal of chemical weapons, Reuters reports, citing the office of the French president, François Hollande. The statement followed talks involving the foreign ministers of the three countries and Hollande in the French capital two days after Russia and the United States hammered out a deal on chemical weapons.

In an open letter to the Lancet, they say large parts of Syria are completely cut off from any form of medical assistance. The signatories, who span five continents, cite figures suggesting 469 health workers are currently imprisoned and about 15,000 doctors have fled the country. In Syria's largest city, Aleppo, there are just 36 physicians, compared to 5,000 before the civil war began, they say. We are appalled by the lack of access to healthcare for affected civilians, and by the deliberate targeting of medical facilities and personnel. It is our professional, ethical, and moral duty to provide treatment and care to anyone in need. When we cannot do so personally, we are obliged to speak out in support of those risking their lives to provide life-saving assistance. Updated at 11.47am BST  9.52am BST  Syria's main opposition group has rejected the Geneva chemical weapons deal claiming it will embolden the Assad regime to carry on killing civilians . The Syrian National Coalition expressed alarm at a number of crucial omissions in the agreement including the absence of any threat of force for non-compliance, and the lack of a commitment to prosecuting those who ordered chemical attacks.  9.36am BST  The US secretary of state, John Kerry, is meeting his British and French counterparts to try to draft a UN resolution that will hold Syria to the deal agreed in Geneva over the handover of Syria's chemical weapons. The key issue is whether they will insist that the Assad regime is threatened with force over non-compliance, as France has suggested. Russia has repeatedly indicated it would veto any UN resolution that threatened Syria with force. After thrashing out the detail of an agreement on Syria's chemical weapons, Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, pointed out that it contained no military threat . "Nothing is said about the use of force or about any automatic sanctions. All violations should be approved by the security council," he said. The leading Republican Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham said the deal was "meaningless" without a threat of force backed by a UN resolution. In Paris for talks with President Hollande, Secretary Kerry and FM Fabius on US-Russia agreement and ensuring Syrian compliance Updated at 11.49am BST  9.06am BST  The UN inspectors' report into the attack on the eastern Damascus suburb of Ghouta has been the subject of much pre-briefing. Officials and diplomats told Foreign Policy's Cable blog that the report would point to enough circumstantial evidence to implicate the Assad regime. "You can conclude from the type of evidence the [identity of the] author," it quoted one official as saying. France's foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, also suggested the report would point to Syrian government involvement . However, the investigators were not asked to assess who was to blame for the 21 August attack, but only whether chemical weapons were used. They spent just under two weeks in Syria investigating the evidence. The US, France and the UK have presented separate intelligence reports claiming the Assad regime was behind the attack. Updated at 11.50am BST  8.39am BST  Welcome to Middle East Live. Here's a roundup of the latest developments on the crisis in Syria: •  The United Nations is expected to release the much-anticipated results of an investigation into allegations of a chemical weapons attacks last month near Damascus. The lead investigator, Åke Sellström, has submitted his report to the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon. Diplomats claim the report will implicate the Assad regime in the attack. •  An exchange of letters between Barack Obama and the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, has set the stage for the possibility of the first face-to-face encounter between a US and Iranian leader since Iran's 1979 revolution. Britain's foreign secretary, William Hague, is also due to meet his Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif, at the UN general assembly meeting in New York. •  Obama raised the prospect of Iran getting involved in broader talks on Syria if Tehran recognised "that what's happening there is a train wreck that hurts not just Syrians but is destabilising the entire region". In an interview with ABC News, Obama presented the Geneva deal on Syria's chemical weapons as an opportunity to bolster diplomacy with Tehran and invited Iranian involvement in international talks about a broader settlement to the Syrian conflict, something Washington had previously resisted. • François Hollande has defended France's hawkish approach to Syria in the face of increasing unpopularity on the issue and a perception that Paris is being marginalised by the new emphasis on diplomacy.  In a TV address, he insisted that if France had not threatened force, "Assad would have continued to threaten the population". •  France, Britain and the United States are due to meet in Paris on Monday to draft a UN resolution based on the agreement for Syria to hand over control of its chemical weapons. The French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, is then due to discuss it with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov on Tuesday. •  A Syrian minister has hailed the deal on chemical weapons as "a victory … won thanks to our Russian friends". In the first comments from Damascus since the accord to disarm Syria of its chemical weapons, Ali Haidar paid tribute to its longstanding ally, praising "the achievement of the Russian diplomacy and the Russian leadership". •  The man chosen by the Syrian opposition to head a government-in-waiting has pledged to confront atrocities being committed by rebel extremists. In an interview with Reuters, Ahmad Tumeh said: "On top of the destruction and killing and displacement the regime has brought, people are now suffering from militants' behaviour' … The people pursued a basic quest for freedom [rather than] deeper despotism."

"Tens of thousands join pro-democracy protest in Hong Kong","Occupy Central activists rally against plan to limit electoral changes after police charge with batons and fire teargas  Tania Branigan in Hong Kong, and  Jonathan Kaiman in Beijing  Sun 28 Sep 2014 18.40 BST   Last modified on Thu 30 Nov 2017 08.14 GMT   Hong Kong police fired teargas and launched baton charges as tens of thousands of pro-democracy protesters brought a central area of the city to a standstill late on Sunday. The demonstrators, equipped with goggles and face masks to ward off teargas and pepper spray, flooded the streets around the government complex in Admiralty – a bustling commercial area in downtown Hong Kong – leading authorities to divert bus routes and shut down a subway station. They chanted for police to leave and for Leung Chun-ying, the city’s chief executive, to resign. The stand-off continued into the early hours of this morning, with police clearing another group in Central but defiant protesters in Admiralty dispersing and then regrouping repeatedly. Volunteers barricaded roads and tried to block police from advancing by surrounding them, raising their hands in the air to show they would not attack. Smaller protests sprang up in the shopping district of Causeway Bay and in Mong Kok, Kowloon. In a recorded statement, posted on a government website in the early morning, Leung reassured the public that the Chinese army would not intervene, as some had rumoured. “I hope the public will keep calm. Don’t be misled by the rumours,” he said, urging everyone to return home. “We don’t want Hong Kong to be messy.” Many members of the initial surge left late on Sunday night as the Hong Kong Federation of Students urged protesters to retreat, citing concerns that police might escalate their use of force. “Stay safe. This is a long battle,” it wrote on Twitter. One member of a first aid team preparing to withdraw for the night said she feared police were ready to use “Beijing rules, not Hong Kong rules”. But thousands more remained at the scene at Admiralty. The protest’s main organiser, Occupy Central with Peace and Love, has called for a new era of civil disobedience to protest against the government’s plans to tightly limit electoral changes, despite long-held promises that the city’s residents would be allowed to choose their own leader by 2017. The demonstration was originally planned to begin later this week, but Occupy Central brought the protest’s starting date forward after a group of students, galvanised by a week of peaceful protest, invaded the city’s main government compound on Friday night. At least 34 people have been injured in the clashes, while nearly 80 people have been arrested since Friday. Benny Tai, one of Occupy Central’s leaders, said the movement would continue until Leung resigned and Beijing changed its position on political reform. As thousands of supporters gathered, Tai told the South China Morning Post: “It is totally unexpected ... it’s all about our pursuit of democracy. Beijing now sees it; the world sees it; CY Leung, do you see it?” Beijing has promised universal suffrage for the next chief executive election in 2017. But the framework it announced is so restrictive that it would effectively bar any democrat from standing – the two or three candidates will be vetted by a nominating committee composed largely of Beijing loyalists. Critics have called the arrangement a sham and an exercise in Iranian-style democracy. The former British colony enjoys considerable autonomy under the “one country, two systems” framework, but many believe Beijing is intent on eroding its freedoms, such as independent courts and a free press. Beijing has shown no sign of backing down. On Sunday evening, the central government’s Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office condemned the protest as an illegal gathering, and expressed confidence that the Hong Kong government would “handle the Occupy Central movement according to law”, the state newswire Xinhua reported. While some left as police fired teargas – a highly unusual tactic in Hong Kong – others appeared to have been galvanised by officers’ tactics. “The actions of the police are showing the public what a tyrannical government looks like,” said Bonnie Leung, 27. The Hong Kong Professional Teachers’ Union announced it would strike on Monday in protest at police brutality. The Hong Kong Federation of Students also announced plans to indefinitely extend a week-long class boycott that began last Monday. Stanley Chan, one of a group of 17-year-old friends who had just arrived, said: “They need us. They need more people to come out. We are worried, but we are not afraid.” The teenagers said their parents were concerned about the risks but supported their decision. Most of those in the crowd appeared to be in their teens or their 20s and 30s, though older participants were present too – one middle-aged woman wiped her eyes with a damp towel as she recovered from the effects of teargas. They were good-tempered and at times well organised, with volunteers clearing the way for deliveries of water bottles to thirsty protesters. Rachel Lam, one of the volunteers proffering rolls of plastic wrap for those in need of impromptu eye shields, said: “When I watched TV this afternoon, I was so furious, I came to support the students and protesters.” The 35-year-old teacher was pessimistic about the prospects of the stand-off ending peacefully, and said the wider community in Hong Kong was still split over the issue. “In my family, my mother doesn’t support this. She didn’t allow me to come here, but I told her it was my responsibility,” she added. But many of those present said they would probably have to go to work on Monday rather than protesting. Michael Davis, a professor at Hong Kong University who was present during the clashes, said: “If there’s violence out of Occupy Central, it will be because the government is heavy-handed. We are talking about a society that has lived under freedom, a free press, and free markets for as long as they can remember. Now they are told they are going to have some kind of ‘mainland style’ democracy.” In a statement released in the early hours, Hong Kong police said that officers had exercised restraint and acted in a highly professional manner. It added: “Police urge the protesters to stay calm, and stop charging police cordon lines and occupying the main roads, so that the roads can be reopened to emergency and public vehicles.” Officers appeared to be expecting a long night, with scores sleeping on the floors of a concrete overpass and an office and shopping complex."
"If war builds civilisations, the left has a problem","Sat 19 Oct 2013 12.00 BST   First published on Sat 19 Oct 2013 12.00 BST   S urely war is the opposite of civilisation? But a study in the Proceedings of the [American] National Academy of Sciences makes a powerful case that war has also been the driving force behind the emergence of civilised societies – roughly speaking, those organised enough to have social relationships run on an impersonal basis, with bureaucracies and networks of mutual trust that allow you to deal with a stranger in the reasonable confidence that you won't be killed. The underlying argument is that states are costly for their inhabitants. They interfere with liberty. They stop people doing what they want. So they will arise only where there are benefits to outweigh the costs both of belonging and of policing the others who belong. This is a beautiful example of the spread of the use of evolutionary arguments to understand cultural processes. The idea is plausible, and has no doubt been expressed by many historians. The idea that warfare between groups led to the development of desirable human moral characteristics and in particular to unselfishness, is very clear in Darwin's work and was later bastardised in the jingoistic fevers of Europe before the first world war. But I don't think it has been so clearly expressed before now in cultural terms. It certainly hasn't been computer-modelled in quite the same way. What we know is that large-scale civilisations first appeared in areas where agricultural cultures came into contact with nomadic steppe people. This applies in Mesopotamia/Iran, China and Egypt. What the researchers did was to map Europe, Asia and north Africa into 100km squares, each of which had scores for military technology – in the first instance horses but later stirrups, bows and arrows, and so forth – agriculture and ultrasocial traits. Every turn of the simulation represented 100 years, and in each turn there was a chance that agricultural areas would unite and an ultrasocial trait would spread. Military technology also diffused from the nomads, so that an agricultural region was vulnerable not just to the pastoralists of the steppe but to neighbouring cultures that had learned to combine the use of horses or weapons with agriculture. When this simulation was run over 7,000 years, the results were eerily close to what actually happened. "Ultrasocial" societies – civilisations – emerged and spread in the same places and at about the same times as happened in real history. The determining factor was the spread of military technology, and the demands that resisting it and wielding it placed on social organisation. It's easy to think of possible counter-examples. The history of western Europe from about 400AD to 1400AD is one of almost continuous warfare with very little state building indeed and that very slow. The idea that this is a law of history is obviously ridiculous. But it is a tendency, and a mechanism, which can be seen at work. One of the things I like about this argument is that it explains why western Europe has welfare states and the US has not. The welfare states of western Europe had their genesis as a means of war preparation – you can see this very clearly under Bismarck – and grew to seem inevitable in the period from 1914 to 1945, when the continent ripped itself apart in war, and the necessity of solidarity was obvious to all the survivors. The American experience of those years was entirely different. This is something that really ought to worry the left. It's rather frightening to think that the solidarity of being all bombed together was largely responsible for the spirit of 1945. No wonder Ed Miliband can't bring it back. Things may be bad today but they aren't that bad, or not bad in that way. So it's most unlikely they will get better."
"UK, EU, and Nato - all in need of a 'new world order'?","Tue 2 Sep 2014 11.21 BST   First published on Tue 2 Sep 2014 11.21 BST   More than 50 years ago, Henry Kissinger, America's best known political scientist, hugely controversial diplomat and national security adviser, wrote his first book. A World Restored is a study, a celebration really, of how Count Metternich, the Austrian chancellor, brilliantly managed the international order, balancing power through a maze of alliances, in the early nineteenth century. Kissinger was also a keen student of the 1648 Treaty of Westphalia which established principles of international order based on sovereign states (and empires) following the Thirty Years War. Two years ago, Kissinger warned of the consequences of the Arab Spring and humanitarian intervention in a state's internal affairs. "In reacting to one human tragedy, we must be careful not to facilitate another", he warned readers of the Washington Post. "In the absence of a clearly articulated strategic concept, a world order that erodes borders and merges international and civil wars can never catch its breath." Later this week, Kissinger publishes his latest work, World Order: Reflections on the Character of Nations and the Course of History (Allen Lane). He compares the Middle East today with Europe's 17th century wars of religion. "Domestic and international conflicts reinforce each other. Political, sectarian, tribal, territorial, ideological, and traditional national-interest disputes merge", he wrote in an extract for the Sunday Times. If order cannot be established, "vast areas risk being opened to anarchy and to forms of extremism that will spread organically into other regions." The world, says Kissinger, awaits "the distillation of a new regional order by America and other countries in a position to take a global view". This is a good moment to consider Kissinger's concerns, whatever one thinks of his own past interventions, in Cambodia for example, his own particular view of the world. This week's Nato summit in Newport in South Wales takes place against the background of the crisis in Ukraine. Vladimir Putin has called for "statehood" for the east of the country - though his advisers said he realy meant some kind of federal constitution for Ukraine . The boundary between Syria and Iraq, drawn in the sand by Britain and France 98 years ago, is disappearing. In Syria , control over territory is fractured as rebel groups fight each other as well as Syrian government forces. In Iraq , it is determined by members of different religious or ethnic group - Sunni or Shia, or Kurd. Jihadists from Europe and elsewhere are crossing the Turkish frontier into Syria where the Assad government is supported by Russia and Shia Iran. Extreme and violent Islamist groups are crossing borders in east, northern, and west Africa. The Israeli government, meanwhile, has laid claim to nearly 1000 acres of land - said to be the largest appropriation of Palestinian land in 30 years - in the occupied West Bank near Bethlehem. David Cameron used tough language on Monday in the House of Commons described the Israeli move as "utterly deplorable" before announcing new anti-terror measures and proposals designed to stop potential British jihadists from leaving the UK, or returning home. Cameron's pitch was rather less shrill on terrorism than his earlier rhetoric after the propaganda video apparently showing a Briton killing the American journalist, James Foley (He was clearly terrified about Washington's response). But listening to advice from his more sober officials, including government lawyers, and after warnings from Liberal Democrats (and former senior MI6 officers) Cameron toughed about the need to introduce "tough" measures but also a "patient" approach. Cameron spoke of specific and targeted measures, and discretionary powers. It all depends, of course, on how they are used, notably by the police. It is curious, that at the time of globalisation- whether it is jihadism, the movement of labour, financial markets, trade, social media, music, fashion – and when close international cooperation is essential in the battle against terrorism and the causes of terrorism (as Cameron himself admits) that an apparently growing number of people in Scotland want to become "independent", and an apparently growing number of people in England – UKIP supporters – want to leave the EU. Even a "two-state" solution for Israel and Palestine would not be quite what it may suggest, given the porous borders and almost certain Israeli control over Palestinian airspace. Old national borders are becoming increasingly irrelevant. The concept of national sovereignty is eroding all the time. Even Putin must appreciate that. The question is how to respond to the challenge posed by Kissinger, and others, and counter nationalists who want to erect new borders and internationalists who want to break them down, not to promote cooperation but to impose their own sectarian and violent creeds. A "new regional order" could be based not on erecting new national state structures but on a new kind of federalism - federalism in Ukraine, in Scotland, Spain (where it is already rooted) and elsewhere. Federalism need not be a dirty word if it is democratic and comes from the bottom up – something Brussels above all would need to understand."
"Let's be honest – the global warming debate isn't about science","Fri 4 Oct 2013 05.40 BST   First published on Fri 4 Oct 2013 05.40 BST   The 2013 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report states with 95 percent confidence that humans have caused most, and probably all of the rapid global warming over the past 60 years . Approximately 97 percent of climate experts and peer-reviewed climate science studies agree. There are of course open questions yet to be answered by climate scientists – precisely how sensitive the climate is to the increased greenhouse effect, for example. But even in a best case, low sensitivity scenario, we're headed for dangerously rapid climate change if we continue on our current business as usual path. And the worst case scenario, which is just as likely as the best case scenario, would mean we're headed for a global catastrophe. The IPCC warns that if we want to avoid very dangerous climate change, we're on track to blow through our allowed carbon budget in as little as two to three decades if we continue on our current path of relying on fossil fuels. If we're lucky and the low sensitivity scenario is accurate, perhaps we'll have an extra decade or two, but even in this best case scenario, we're on an unsustainable climate path. The scientific evidence is what it is, and it has no political bias. The same is not true of the media outlets that cover the topic. It's not a coincidence that politically conservative tabloids and newspapers like the Daily Mail, Telegraph, Australian, and Wall Street Journal spend a disproportionate amount of time amplifying the voices of the less than 3 percent of climate contrarian scientists, as well as many non-scientist contrarians. It's certainly not the case that David Rose has some brilliant insight into the state of climate science that climate scientists don't have. He and his fellow climate contrarians simply approach the question backwards. They start from their political ideological opposition to climate solutions and work backwards, seeking out cherry picked evidence to justify their predetermined conclusions, thus ignoring the 97 percent of inconvenient scientific evidence. This climate contrarianism ideological bias is illustrated in a new study, summarized by Graham Readfearn : "if you're a conservative who believes the world runs best when businesses operate in a "free market" with little government interference, then the chances are you don't think human-caused climate change represents a significant risk to human civilisation." Even if you're not convinced by the scientific evidence, you should support taking action to mitigate global warming. What if you're wrong, as the body of scientific evidence indicates is the case? There is unquestionably a possible scenario in which our greenhouse gas emissions cause harmful and potentially catastrophic climate damages. I know what contrarians are thinking – what if I'm wrong, and we end up wasting money deploying green technologies, cleaning the air and water and transitioning away from limited fossil fuel resources in the process? That's why we need everyone helping to craft the best possible solutions to maximize the economic benefit of this inevitable transition. Take the USA as a prime example. The Obama Administration recognizes the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but Republicans in Congress refuse to even consider any climate legislation. As a result, government greenhouse gas regulations are the only available option. From an economic perspective, it's far from an ideal solution, but because the Republican Party won't participate in crafting better legislation, we're forced to implement less than ideal solutions. The situation in Australia and Canada is even worse, with politically conservative parties running the governments and refusing to take any action to achieve serious greenhouse gas emissions reductions. The new Australian Prime Minister has even vowed to eliminate Australia's carbon pricing system . Are you a supporter of the free market? Then advocate for allowing the free market solve the problem by pricing greenhouse gas emissions. The debate should be about how to best achieve greenhouse gas emissions reductions with maximum economic benefit. To utilize the free market by pricing carbon emissions, the main options are a carbon cap and trade system or a carbon tax. Then there's the question of what to do with the revenue generated by the emissions price. Some options include reducing the federal deficit, funding green technology research and deployment, lowering other taxes, and returning the funds directly to the citizens. A growing number of Republicans in the USA favor the latter, revenue neutral carbon tax approach. British Columbia has a revenue-neutral carbon tax, offset by decreases in income taxes, and the system enjoys broad support from 64 percent of citizens . The province's economy is doing well and its greenhouse gas emissions are falling. They've shown that a well-crafted climate solution can work. Ultimately this climate 'debate' is not about science. The scientific evidence is crystal clear that humans are causing rapid global warming. The longer we wait to do something about it, the more climate change we commit ourselves to, and higher the chances are for a climate catastrophe. From a risk management perspective, failing to take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is just plain stupid . Opposition to climate action isn't about the science, it's about the politics and policies. So let's debate those policies. The more input we have from different political and ideological perspectives, the better crafted the solutions will be. After all, Republicans came up with the concept of cap and trade as an alternative to government regulation of pollutants, and it was a good, successful idea . Denying the science and obstructing the solutions will only make the problem worse. It also results in climate solutions that are far from ideal, like US government greenhouse gas regulations instead of legislation allowing the free market to solve the problem. We need everyone on board to help craft the best possible climate solutions and help grow the economy in the process. Climate change is a situation that fits the adage "you're either part of the solution or you're part of the problem." Be part of the solution."
"Obama: violation of Ukraine 'would be deeply destabilizing' – live updates","Haroon Siddique and  Ben Quinn London and  Tom McCarthy and  Alan Yuhas in New York  Sat 1 Mar 2014 00.58 GMT    First published on Fri 28 Feb 2014 07.40 GMT     12.58am GMT  We’re going to close the blog for now but it will be re-opened to take in any significant developments.  12.31am GMT  Mikheil Saakashvili, president of Georgia at a time when that country fought a five-day war with Russia in 2008 over the Georgian breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, has been pushing for the US to take punitive financial measures against Russia. Saakashvili, a studio guest on CNN, said that it would be wrong to underestimate Ukraine’s military strength, adding that its officer corps was of a high calibre and that a “considerable chunk” of Russian officers were ethnically Ukrainian. He added that “we might get real war between two big European countries” but called on the US to expell Russia from the G8 and “send tax inspectors” into banks where there was Russian interests. In a hawkish appearance, he added: If this order in Europe collapses, the US will be in trouble. If it goes to hell then certainly American interests will be at great risk. Updated at 12.59am GMT  12.17am GMT  Other than skipping the G8 and imposing trade and other sanctions, the extent of US leverage over Russia on Ukraine seems limited, according to Stephen Collinson , the AFP’s White House Correspondent. He adds on Twitter: No path through UN Security Council and Obama needs Putin on Iran talks, Syrian chemical weapons and logistical exit from Afghanistan  11.49pm GMT  A senior administration official in Washington DC has said that the US is considering pulling out of this Summer’s G8 summit in Russia. A US boycott of the June meeting would be a major blow to Putin, particularly if backed by European G8 members- the UK, Italy, Germany and France. The senior administration official told the Guardian’s Paul Lewis: We are consulting with European partners and considering options. It is hard to see how we and other European leaders would attend the G8 in Sochi if Russia is intervening in Ukraine .  11.41pm GMT  From the United Nations, here’s something more specific in terms of an emerging US response to the crisis. The US ambassador to the UN has told reporters that that her government is proposing an urgent mediation mission. Samantha Power said that the United States wants mediators who will be “seen as independent, credible”. The Associated Press adds: She suggested U.N. official Robert Serry could be part of the mission. Serry was the Netherlands’ first ambassador to Ukraine.  She also said that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe had experts who would be seen as credible. British U.N. Ambassador Mark Lyall Grant later said that such a mediation mission would not require the blessing of the U.N. Security Council. Russia has a council veto and could block action there.  Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin said he opposed “imposed mediation.” Updated at 12.08am GMT  11.35pm GMT  The US ambassador in Kiev has tweeted this link to the full text of President Obama’s White House statement earlier this evening, in which he warned that “any violation of Ukrainian sovereignty would be deeply destabilizing.” Statement by the President Obama on #Ukraine - http://t.co/M1RMMV5GuI  11.31pm GMT  More from the Ukrainian authorities. The country’s defence ministry has said it had information that unknown “radical forces” were planning to try to disarm its military units in Crimea and warned against such action. The ministry said in a statement on its Website: In the case of such unknown actions, the Ukrainian armed forces will act in accordance with the laws of Ukraine and the regulations of the Ukrainian armed forces.  11.25pm GMT  A spokesman for the Ukrainian border service has said that said eight Russian transport planes landed in Crimea Peninsula in southern Ukraine with unknown cargo. Serhiy Astakhov told The Associated Press that the Il-76 planes arrived unexpectedly and were given permission to land, one after the other, at Gvardeiskoye air base, north of the regional capital, Simferopol (below). Astakhov said the people in the planes refused to identify themselves and waved off customs officials, saying they didn’t require their services.  This is Ben Quinn taking over the blog now from Tom.  11.04pm GMT  • In a hastily called statement broadcast live, US president Barack Obama warned Russia that “there will be costs for any military intervention in Ukraine” and that “any violation of Ukrainian sovereignty would be deeply destabilizing.” • Obama said the United States was “deeply concerned by reports of military movements taken by the Russian federation inside Ukraine.” So far US officials have not referred to specific activity. • “The US calls on Russia to pull back the military forces that are being built up in the region,”  said US ambassador to the UN Samantha Power. • Armed militias whose precise identity was unknown remain in control of two airports in Crimea, while Russian troop transport vehicles and helicopters were photographed on the move in the region. •  Russia denied that it was conducting or preparing to conduct a military intervention in Crimea. “Really, even the question is aggravating!” said the Russian ambassador to the UN. The Russian Black Sea fleet, resident in Sevastopol, said it was taking “anti-terror” measures. • “They’re provoking us into an armed conflict,” said Ukrainian acting president Oleksandr Turchynov. He said the Ukrainian military would not be baited. He called on Russian president Vladimir Putin to “stop provocations.” • Deposed president Viktor Yanukovych held a news conference in Russia. He said he was still the “legitimate president” and said elections scheduled by parliament for 25 May were a sham. He said Western powers “connived” to depose him. • Both the Russian foreign ministry and the Russian ambassador to the United Nations were pointing to  the agreement of 21 February as the key to resolving the Ukraine crisis. • The U.N. Security Council, including Russia, held private consultations on the crisis with no publicized result. Updated at 11.07pm GMT  10.47pm GMT  Guardian national security editor Spencer Ackerman (@ attackerman ) notes a very non-response-like quality to a Pentagon response to questions about Ukraine. Spencer writes: While Russian assertiveness in Crimea today is undeniable, in Washington, it’s become a matter of certifying if Russia has actually, directly and overtly moved its forces into the area. The Pentagon is publicly agnostic. Air Force Lt. Col. Damien Pickart, a Pentagon spokesman, says US defense officials are monitoring what he calls “the situation in the Crimea.” “We’re not prepared to offer an assessment or characterize this fluid situation,” Pickart said. Perhaps the public stance is a matter of giving diplomacy a chance to reverse Russian gains. Perhaps it’s actual Pentagon confusion.  10.41pm GMT  Both the Russian foreign ministry and the Russian ambassador to the United Nations are pointing to the agreement of 21 February as the key to resolving the Ukraine crisis. “The best way to resolve the crisis is to look hard” at the agreement signed one week ago , said Vitaly Churkin, the Russian ambassador to the United Nations, in a news conference following the emergency security council meeting. Churkin did not acknowledge that protesters in Kiev never accepted the agreement and that Yanukovych had fled the capital by last Friday night. Russian FM #Lavrov insists on implementing Feb 21 #Ukraine agreement http://t.co/TWLC4h7kMs  @rusembusa  @mission_russian  #Syria  #Geneva The Guardian’s Alan Yuhas (@ AlanYuhas ) listened to Churkin’s statement. He was asked about the upheaval of the last week. “[None of this] shouldn’t have started at all,” Churkin said: Ukraine had a democratically elected president with a democratically elected majority in parliament. Yatsenyuk could’ve taken the post [of prime minister, offered during negotiations], and could’ve signed the agreement with the European Union if he wanted, but then they went for toppling the president and a regime-change operation. Interference from our western colleagues has not been helpful, and they have certain responsibilities to those dramatic consequences and also responsibilities for not following through on those agreements they affixed their signatures on February 21. The best way to resolve the crisis is to look hard at the February 21 agreement. They need to [reform] a constitution. they need to refrain from a hasty presidential election which is likely to cause more friction. They need to show that this is about national unity. When asked about Russia’s willingness to intervene militarily, Churkin laughed. “Really, even the question is aggravating!” he said. Updated at 10.43pm GMT  10.21pm GMT  Obama said that in conversations with Putin he had proposed a cooperation. “I also spoke several days ago with president Putin,” Obama said, “and we’ve made clear that they can be part of an international effort to support the stability and success of a united Ukraine going forward.” “Over the last several days, the United States has been responding to events as they unfold in Ukraine,” Obama said. Throughout this crisis, he said, the United States has consistently said that “the Ukrainian people must have the opportunity to determine” their own government. Updated at 10.22pm GMT  10.13pm GMT  “We are now deeply concerned by reports of military movements taken by the Russian federation inside Ukraine,” Obama said. He referred to reports without mentioning specific US intelligence. “Russia has an historic relationship with the Ukraine,” Obama acknowledged, noting the Black Sea fleet post in Sevastopol. However, Obama said, “any violation of Ukrainian sovereignty would be deeply destabilizing.” “It would present a profound interference in matters that must be decided by the Ukrainian people,” he said, and “it would invite the condemnation of the international community.” As for what action the United States might take: “The United States will stand with the international community in affirming that there will be costs for any military intervention in Ukraine.” Updated at 10.17pm GMT  10.09pm GMT  President Obama is speaking. He says “any violation of Ukrainian sovereignty would be deeply destabilizing.” “It would present a profound interference in matters that must be decided by the Ukrainian people,” he said. Updated at 10.24pm GMT  9.48pm GMT  The United States is “deeply concerned” by “facts on the ground” in Ukraine, US ambassador to the UN Samantha Power said following an emergency meeting of the UN security council. Power said the US is concerned “by what we see as the facts on the ground.” She says the United States is “gravely disturbed by reports of Russian military deployments into the Crimea ” but did not mention specific US intelligence. The U.S. stands with the people of #Ukraine in determining their own destiny, their own government, and their own future. “The US calls on Russia to pull back the military forces that are being built up in the region,” she said. “I’m not going to characterize the movements, beyond [to say] we are deeply concerned by these reports,” she said. Power said the United States had asked for Russia’s help on “getting Ukraine back onto a path to a brighter future.” Updated at 10.58pm GMT  9.36pm GMT  President Barack Obama will deliver a statement shortly on the situation in Ukraine, the White House has announced. The statement is to begin at 4.45pm ET, in about 10 minutes.  9.28pm GMT   9.13pm GMT  The Guardian’s Alan Yuhas (@ AlanYuhas ), working from two Russian  transcripts , has translated the statement by Ukrainian acting president Oleksandr Turchynov (see previous excerpts here ) : In an act of naked aggression against Ukraine, and under the pretense of military exercises, Russia has brought military forces into the Autonomous Republic of Crimea. Not only have they seized Crimea’s parliament and Council, they’ve tried to take control of civilian facilities and communications, and tried to block the positions of Ukrainian forces. “They are provoking us into an armed conflict. Based on our intelligence, they’re working on scenarios analogous to Abkhazia, in which they provoke conflict, and then they start to annex territory. “Ukraine’s military will fulfill its duties, but will not succumb to provocation, and is not entering into armed conflict, understanding the high danger that this would expose to the civilian population of Crimea. “I personally address President Putin with the demand that he immediately end this provocation and recall troops from Crimea, and that we work within the frames of existing agreements. “In 1994 Ukraine unilaterally renounced nuclear weapons in exchange for a guarantee of its safety from the US, Russia and Great Britain. … The whole civilized world supports Ukraine.” “We are trying to neutralize this provocation, we are trying to normalize the situation. We are sure that Ukraine will preserve its territory, Ukraine will defend its independence, and any attempt at annexation, invasion, will have very serious consequences.” Updated at 9.17pm GMT  8.43pm GMT  One Ukrainian official claimed late on Friday evening that 2,000 Russian troops had arrived in Crimea during the course of the day, in 13 Russian aircraft, Guardian Moscow correspondent Shaun Walker (@ ShaunWalker7 ) reports. Senior Ukrainian official Sergiy Kunitsyn told Crimea’s ATR television channel that Russian aircraft carrying the troops had landed at a military air base near Simferopol, AFP reported . Kunitsyn is permanent representative of the Ukrainian president in Crimea: "Those who masterminded this did not think about the people" The recent US ambassador to Russia writes: If gunmen in Crimea are not acting on Kremlin's behalf, it would calming for Russian govt. to say so. Silence fuels uncertainty, instability Updated at 9.02pm GMT  8.29pm GMT  How much would you pay for a shooting range with a moving wild boar? According to a Ukrainian investigation into documents left at the deposed president’s residence, Yanukovych spent $115,000. The Associated Press has more on YanukovychLeaks.org: Visitors to the YanukovychLeaks.org website can browse what appear to be the expense payments for running the sprawling compound just outside Kiev that reportedly was the Yanukovych’s home. The website had 1,581 documents online by Friday afternoon after attracting more than 300,000 visitors a day for several days this week. “The recovered documents are being published on this website to make them available to journalists and citizens around the world,” the site said. “The investigations based on these documents will also be published here and in Ukrainian media.” The documents include a payment of over $115,000 for a shooting range with a moving wild boar and $2.3 million for a tea room. Many other payments seem routine, such as money for roads and gardening, and $150 for tennis balls. There were payments to six cooks and three waiters.  8.05pm GMT  Acting Ukrainian president Oleksandr Turchyno v is speaking in Kiev. He has accused Russia of aggression and called on president Vladimir Putin to “stop provocations.” “They’re provoking us into an armed conflict,” Turchynov said, according to Gazeta . “Based on our sources, they’re working on scenarios that would be analogous to Abkhazia, when they provoke conflict, and then they start to annex territory.” The “Abkhazian” line refers to Russia’s 2008 intervention in Georgia over the breakaway Akhazia region, which has a large ethnic Russian population. BBC is live translating : • Mr Turchynov called on Russian President Putin to “stop provocations”, start negotiations and immediately “pull out” Russian troops. • Ukraine’s acting leader said that the “Ukrainian army is not responding” to the provocations in Crimea. . @Turchynov : I'm addressing President Putin to stop provocation, call back military from Crimea, work exclusively w/in framework of agrmnts UPDATE: Guardian Moscow correspondent Shaun Walker has more from Turchynov: I am personally addressing President Putin to stop the provocation and call back the military from the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, and work exclusively within the framework of the signed agreements.

EU officials have estimated Ukraine’s short-term needs at around $4 billion. Separately, US Senator Chris Murphy, chairman of a Senate subcommittee on European Affairs, said an aid package for Ukraine would be part of “a broader, coordinated program” with the European Union, International Monetary Fund and other international partners, Reuters reports: “I encourage the new government to implement the necessary economic reforms to stabilize the economy and set Ukraine on a path to prosperity, including rooting out corruption and increasing transparency in government finances,” the Connecticut Democrat said in a statement. “Ukraine’s leading industrialists might also consider how they can play a helpful role in stabilizing the economy,” Murphy said. Also, a team of financial experts from the European Commission planned to travel to Ukraine on Monday to assess exactly how much financial assistance it needs, EU officials said on Friday, according to Reuters: The team from the Commission’s directorate-general for economic and financial affairs is expected to meet Ukrainian finance ministry and central bank officials to determine what the country’s budget shortfall and capital needs are. “The first thing we need to do is to understand precisely how much they need,” said a senior official briefed on the visit. “There are a lot of numbers being thrown around and it isn’t helping to clarify the situation.” Finally, the EU’s trade chief said on Friday that Ukraine would see the economic benefits of a free-trade deal with the European Union within weeks of signing the accord, Reuters reports: Despite the upheaval since pro-EU Ukrainians drove the Russian-backed President Viktor Yanukovich from power, EU Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht told Reuters that Brussels’ offer of a comprehensive trade deal was Ukraine’s for the taking. “The offer stands, that’s very clear. We are ready to sign when Ukraine is ready to sign,” De Gucht said in an interview following a meeting of EU trade ministers in Athens. “The benefits will be seen a couple of weeks after the signature.”  5.52pm GMT  The United States is watching “very closely” “whether Russia might be crossing the line in any way, the intervention line,” White House spokesman Jay Carney says at his daily briefing. “Ukraine territorial integrity needs to be respected,” Carney said. “Ukrainian sovereignty needs to be respected. And it would be a grave mistake to intervene.” “We are concerned about reports of Russian intervention or of aggression,” Carney says. “We evaluate this... in a variety of ways,” in partnership with allies and in direct communications with Ukrainian and Russian officials, he says. “Obviously there are various conversations happening in real time with regard to this very fluid situation.” Updated at 5.54pm GMT  5.43pm GMT  German Chancellor Angela Merkel told Putin in their call Friday that steps toward escalation must be avoided, her spokesman said. “She also urged restraint over Crimea,” her spokesman Steffen Seibert said in a statement quoted by Reuters.

Security Council will hold private consultations on Friday to discuss the crisis in Ukraine, according to the Associated Press: U.N spokesman Martin Nesirky said the council had scheduled a meeting Friday afternoon. [...] However, any action by the Security Council is highly unlikely because Russia is a veto-wielding permanent member and can block any action.  5.38pm GMT  The Russian foreign ministry has authorized the issuance of passports for members of the Berkut , the Ukrainian paramilitary force that acted in support of Yanukovych during the Independence Square protests, according to the ministry’s Facebook page and the ministry web site .

Moscow distributed passports in advance of its 2008 invasion of Georgia, in part under the pretext of protecting Russians.  5.16pm GMT  A line in the statement from Downing Street on David Cameron’s conversation with Vladimir Putin could indicate potential daylight between Putin and Yanukovych on the topic of the Ukrainian election schedule. At his news conference, Yanukovych said he would not take part in elections scheduled for 25 May by Ukraine’s parliament because they were illegitimate and he was still the president. The Downing Street statement says Cameron and Putin “agreed that the free and fair elections that the interim government has pledged to hold are the best way to secure a positive future for Ukraine in which all Ukrainian people are represented.” #ukraine downing st says putin, talking to cameron,supports may election. on tuesday moscow said they were illegitimate via @patrickwintour Updated at 5.20pm GMT  5.09pm GMT  In a trip coordinated with the European Union, the foreign ministers of the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia and deputy Foreign Minister of Poland met Friday in Kiev with Ukraine’s new Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk and Foreign Minister Andriy Deshchitsya. In a statement, Czech Foreign Minister Lubomir Zaoralek said they told their Ukrainian counterpart that they were there to “support the government which was just created.” The Visegrad Group (V4) consists of Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland.  5.06pm GMT  Associated Press journalists in Crimea have spotted a convoy of nine Russian armored personnel carriers and a truck on a road between the port city of Sevastopol and the regional capital, Sinferopol, the news agency reports: The Russian tricolor flags were painted on the vehicles, which were parked on the side of the road near the town of Bakhchisarai, apparently because one of them had mechanical problems. Russia is supposed to notify Ukraine of any troop movements outside the naval base it maintains in Sevastopol under a lease agreement with Ukraine. The Russian Foreign Ministry said movements of armored vehicles belonging to the Russian Black Sea Fleet were prompted by the need to ensure security of its base and didn’t contradict the lease terms. A duty officer at the Ukrainian Defense Ministry said it had no information about the vehicles’ movements. Updated at 5.42pm GMT  4.58pm GMT  Updated at 5.04pm GMT  4.49pm GMT  We’re gathering further details about the calls between Europe and Putin. British prime minister David Cameron called Putin and said that Russia must respect the territorial integrity of Ukraine, a Downing Street spokesman said. Reuters reports: “The Prime Minister emphasised that all countries should respect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine. President Putin agreed, stressing that Russian military exercises in the area had been planned before the current situation in Ukraine,” the spokesman said. “They agreed that the free and fair elections that the interim government has pledged to hold are the best way to secure a positive future for Ukraine.” Cameron and Putin agreed the international community should consider how to help Ukraine tackle its economic challenges, the spokesman said.  4.45pm GMT  “Moscow’s military moves so far resemble a classically executed coup, ” writes former Guardian Moscow correspondent Luke Harding: “seize control of strategic infrastructure, seal the borders between Crimea and the rest of Ukraine, invoke the need to protect the peninsula’s ethnic Russian majority... The Kremlin’s favourite news website, Lifenews.ru , was on hand to record the historic moment. Its journalists were allowed to video Russian forces patrolling ostentatiously outside Simferopol airport . Wearing khaki uniforms – they had removed their insignia – and carrying Kalashnikovs, the soldiers seemed relaxed and in control. Other journalists filming from the road captured Russian helicopters flying into Crimea from the east. They passed truckloads of Russian reinforcements arriving from Sevastopol, home to Russia ‘s Black Sea fleet. The Kremlin has denied any involvement in this very Crimean coup. But Putin’s playbook in the coming days and months is easy to predict. On Thursday, the Crimean parliament announced it would hold a referendum on the peninsula’s future status on 25 May. That is the same day Ukraine goes to the polls in fresh presidential elections. The referendum can have only one outcome: a vote to secede from Ukraine. After that, Crimea can go one of two ways. It could formally join the Russian Federation. Or, more probably, it might become a sort of giant version of South Ossetia or Abkhazia, Georgia’s two Russian-occupied breakaway republics – a Kremlin-controlled puppet exclave, with its own local administration, “protected” by Russian troops and naval frigates. Either way, this amounts to Moscow’s annexation of Crimea, de facto or de jure. Read the full piece here .  4.42pm GMT  Russian President Vladimir Putin has spoken by phone with the leaders of Britain and Germany and the president of the European Council, the Kremlin said on Friday. Putin said there must be no further escalation of violence in Ukraine , according to a Reuters report on the Kremlin statement. UPDATE: The Kremlin statement, in Russian, is here . Putin “strongly stressed the need to avoid further escalation of violence and the necessity to quickly normalize the situation,” the statement says. Updated at 4.52pm GMT  4.39pm GMT  In a phone conversation, US secretary of state John Kerry asked Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov about reports of Russian armored vehicles and personnel in Crimea, and warned Russia not to inflame the situation in Ukraine, Reuters reports: “We raised the issue of the airports, raised the issue of armored vehicles, raised the issue of personnel in various places,” Kerry said of a telephone conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. “While we were told that they are not engaging in any violation of the sovereignty and do not intend to, I nevertheless made it clear that that could be misinterpreted at this moment and that there are enough tensions that it is important for everybody to be extremely careful not to inflame the situation and not to send the wrong messages.”  4.05pm GMT  Guardian Moscow correspondent Shaun Walker (@ shaunwalker7 ) has filed a news story on Yanukovych’s press conference. “I think Russia should, and is obliged, to act, and knowing the character of Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin , I am surprised he is so restrained and keeping silent,” Yanukovych said. “Putin has not commented on the situation in recent days,” Shaun writes, “but the interim Ukrainian government has claimed Russian troops have effectively invaded Crimea”: Yanukovych said he had not met with Putin but the pair had spoken by telephone and the Russian president had agreed to meet him “when he has the possibility”. “As the current president of Ukraine, I want to say that Crimea should stay within the boundaries of Ukraine,” he said, adding that events in the peninsula – where gunmen seized control of two airports and raised the Russian flag above the regional parliament – were “a natural reaction to the bandit coup in Kiev”. He said he believed there should be no military activity in Crimea, but insisted Russia should not “sit in the corner and not act”. Yanukovych said elections scheduled for May by Ukraine’s parliament were illegitimate and he is still the president: “If a president hasn’t resigned, if he hasn’t been impeached, and if he is alive – and you see that I am alive – then he remains the president,” Yanukovych said, dodging a question about how he could possibly act further when even his closest allies had deserted him. He was unable to say when he planned to return to the country, except that it would happen “as soon as the conditions allow for my own safety and the safety of my family.” Read the full piece here .  3.56pm GMT  • Deposed Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych held a news conference in the Russian city of Rostov-on-Don in which he said “I am the legitimate president of Ukraine.” • Yanukovych said Western powers had “ connived with the EuroMaidan forces” in Kiev and that the protesters had failed to honor an agreement forged by European envoys last week. He said he left the country because he had been shot at and he feared for his and his family’s safety. • Military troops in unmarked uniforms resembling Russian uniforms took over two airports in Crimea, Simferopol airport and a military facility at Sevastopol, overnight. Simferopol airport appeared to be operating as normal. •  The new leaders of the Ukrainian government accused Russia of carrying out an “armed invasion.” Russia’s Black Sea fleet, based at Sevastopol, issued a statement both denying military action and saying “anti-terror units” had been deployed to protect the fleet and living quarters. • Reporters witnessed a tense stand off between at least 20 men wearing the uniform of Russia’s Black Sea fleet and carrying automatic rifles and Ukrainian border guards near Sevastopol. No casualties were reported. • The Ukrainian border guard service said that more than 10 Russian military helicopters flew from Russia into Ukrainian airspace over the Crimea region on Friday. • The Russian foreign ministry said in a statement Friday that any movements of Russian military in the area were compliant with laws and treaties. •  Ukraine’s parliament is asking the UN security council to call a session to consider the country’s current problems. It has also urged Russia to stop moves which it says undermine Ukrainian territorial integrity. Updated at 4.03pm GMT  3.48pm GMT  Yanukovych’s message was not universally well-received. RT @KevinRothrock : Instagram reactions to Yanukovich's press conference, courtesy of @novaya_gazeta . pic.twitter.com/FZ8P6SkxOO  3.34pm GMT  One more detail from Yanukovich’s presser: Asked by a Russian media outlet about the luxuriant wealth on display in his home , Yanukovych said not all the belongings were narrowly his and some were faked or staged: Yanukovych says the pictures of how fabulous his interior was, custom cognac, paintings, gold loaf of bread were all fakes to discredit him UPDATE: Guardian Moscow correspondent Shaun Walker (@ shaunwalker7 ) has more on Yanukovych’s answer: When finally asked a direct question about the overstated luxury of the enormous estate, he laughed and said he was the legal owner and had began to renovate it. “I paid for that house with my own money, I paid $3.2m for that house,” he said with a smile, before launching on a long and rambling history of the estate. Updated at 4.07pm GMT  3.13pm GMT  Harriet Salem (@ HarrietSalem ), reporting for the Guardian in Crimea, has more from Vladimir Zhirinovsky , the leader of the far-right Liberal and Democratic Party of Russia, who has arrived in Sevastopol and delivered a speech outside a city administration building. (Read Harriet’s earlier report here .) “Peoples’ lives are the most important,” Zhirinovsky said: [We] don’t want anyone to die, Ukrainians or Russian. We stand here, but already 80 people have died. The deaths in Simferopol were not for political reasons but because emotion put people in the way. We do not accept the new government not because of politics but legally. You cannot just break the constitution. The legal procedures were not followed . The leader of Ukraine is Yanukovych, he is in Russia, but nobody made him leave. He has a right to be here. He fled because he does not have safety in Ukraine. People keep referring to the Budapest Agreement of 1994, of the safety of Ukraine. So now let’s follow this agreement. The safety of the president is not being followed. “I want you to know the position of Moscow is that you will not be left alone or be in trouble. “Everyone is afraid of Russia. We have the most modern weapons, the most impressive. This is why Russia is feared by every country.” Zhirik in Sevastopol. A man who once called C. Rice a "black whore" who should "choke on Russian sperm". Just the chap for nuanced diplomacy Zhirinovsky doubled down on his promise of gas and loans for Crimea, Harriet reports: Crimea and Sevastopol will get whatever they need. There is money. This will be a present from me. A bank loan that does not need to be paid back. Gas will be made available at the lowest prices. Free if you need it. You will all have a TV in your home and more consular services, all over Ukraine, but especially in Sevastopol.” The crowd cheered and clapped, Harriet reports, chanting “Russia, Russia, Russia.” Updated at 3.30pm GMT  2.57pm GMT  A Reuters journalist has witnessed a tense stand off between at least 20 men wearing the uniform of Russia’s Black Sea fleet and carrying automatic rifles and Ukrainian border guards near Sevastopol. This appears to be the incident reported by AP earlier. From Reuters: A Reuters reporter in the Balaklava district saw Ukrainian border police in helmets and riot gear shut inside the border post, with a metal gate pulled shut and metal riot shields placed behind the windows as protection. A servicemen who identified himself as an officer of the Black Sea Fleet told Reuters: “We are here ... so as not to have a repeat of the Maidan.” He was referring to Kiev’s Independence Square, the cradle of a popular uprising that ousted President Viktor Yanukovich. The servicemen’s presence appeared to confirm the veracity of a statement by the Ukrainian border guard service that Russian servicemen were blocking off a unit of Ukrainian border guards in Balaklava.  2.39pm GMT  The Guardian has a gallery of images from Crimea today, including this one.  2.15pm GMT  While that press conference was going on, Russia denied violating an agreement on the movement of its troops in Ukraine’s Crimea region and said that it considers events there the result of internal political differences. The foreign ministry said in a statement it rejected a call for consultations on Crimea with the Ukrainian leadership, describing events there as “as a result of internal political processes in Ukraine”.  2.13pm GMT  Yanukovych is asked about the possibility of a case against him in the Hague. He says there has to be an independent investigation involving the Council of Europe. There was not a single person who was more interested in avoiding bloodshed than myself. Asked about whether Russia considers him the legitimate president of Ukraine, he says: I repeat, I am the legitimate president of Ukraine. He says it is not for him to say what Russia should do but “it can not be indifferent to the destiny of such a big partner as Ukraine”. It needs to use all the leverage it can to prevent “the chaos, the terror unfolding in Ukraine”. He says he would not encourage any attempt at intervention. With that the press conference is being wound up.  1.58pm GMT  Yanukovych says he never gave any order to fire but “the police has a right to self-defence, especially when there have been massive attacks on the police. I think Russia should and is obliged to act, and knowing the character of Vladimir Putin, I am surprised why he is so restrained & silent.  1.57pm GMT  Asked about Ukraine’s former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko, who has been released from prison, Yanukovych says it is “an issue that needs to be considered from a legal standpoint”. Yanukovych says Tymoshenko cost Ukraine $20bn with the disputed gas deal "and she knows that perfectly well" “I’m the legitimate president,” says Yanukovych. He did not resign, was not impeached and is still alive so is still the incumbent and legitimate president. Yanukovych improving on Nixon/Cheney maxim: "If the president says he's still the president, and he's alive, then he's the president"  1.49pm GMT  Yanukovych says he was “cynically deceived” when signing the agreement with the opposition. Asked about divisions in his political party, he says “let God judge them, judge their behaviour in their times”. He does not condemn people who were “forced to take these steps because they were threatened with weapons”. The United States connived with the Maidan opposition forces, they bear the responsibility to the Ukrainian people. Asked if he will take part in the May presidential elections - a moot point as it is highly unlikely at present that he would be allowed to take part - he says he will not as they are illegal. The responsibility for implementing the agreement struck just before he left Kiev rests with the west, says Yanukovych. Asked about the freezing of his assets, his son and others and the criminal proceedings issued against him in Switzerland , Yanukovych ignores the question, instead calling for an end to lawlessness in Kiev.  1.36pm GMT  Yanukovych says any military actions in Crimea are “unacceptable”. He says he won’t request any military assistance from Russia. “Ukraine needs to be united.” He says he will return to Ukraine when his security and that of his family have been assured. The ousted president said he arrived in Russia “thanks to the patriotically-minded officers”. He has not met President Putin yet but spoke to him on the phone and they agreed to meet when there is an opportunity. Reporter: Are you ashamed? Yanukovych: I am. I apologize for not retaining the power & stability in the country pic.twitter.com/gVoBmTKlxK  1.32pm GMT  Yanukovych says he is in Rostov, rather than Moscow, because an old friend lives there. He goes on: Everything happening in Crimea today is a natural result of the bandits’ regime change that took place in Kiev ...of course I sympathise with what is happening today, the formation of self-defence militia units. They want to defend themselves ...that is natural. He urges people to avoid any conflict. Crimea needs to stay part of Ukraine, of course by maintaining a broad autonomy.  1.29pm GMT  Yanukovych is asked whether he feels ashamed for anything. He apologises that he “did not have enough strength to maintain stability” and prevent the crisis. Yanukovych denies that he fled initially but says he was exposed to gunfire from automatic weapons when in a car. He was supposed to take part in a conference with party members in Kharkov but when he arrived he heard that radical groups were arriving in Kharkov. The ousted president says he was not in fear but “had to maintain the security conditions”. Eventually he went to Crimea and his intentions were ruined by “new threats”. Even his youngest grandchild was “put on a blacklist”, he says. Yanukovych says he could not risk the lives of his family.  1.22pm GMT  Yanukovych says the agreement to bring an end to the crisis had to be agreed by both sides and he believed in “the bona fide character of the [international] intermediaries”. He said under the agreement the protesters were supposed to hand over their weapons and unblock the streets but that did not happen. Instead innocent people suffered, he says. They were robbed and beaten in the streets and cultural institutions and churches were destroyed. This is lawlessnesses, terror, anarchy and chaos, complete absence of power.  1.16pm GMT  Yanukovych says there should be constitutional reform by the end of the year, presidential elections in December and then a new constitution should be adopted. Arms need to be handed over, armed gunmen need to leave the streets and buildings and squares “unblocked”. He says the west “connived with the EuroMaidan forces” and must bear responsibility for what has happened there. He’s now stopped speaking but is taking questions. Yanukovych: The time has come for me to say that I intend to continue the fight for the future of Ukraine... Nobody has overthrown me  1.12pm GMT  Yanukovych begins by saying it is high time for him to announce his decision “to fight for the future of Ukraine against those who use fear and power”. He says he was forced to leave Ukraine because of the threat to his life and his relatives’ life. Ukraine has been taken over by fascists, representing a minority of the Ukrainian people, he says.  1.05pm GMT  Viktor Yanukovych is due to begin his press conference, from southern Russia according to Russia Today, shortly. Here is a live feed.  1.02pm GMT  Ukraine’s state border guard service says about 30 Russian marines had taken positions outside its coastguard base in Sevastopol, AP reports. The agency quoted the marines from the 810th brigade of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet as saying they were there to prevent any weapons at the base from being seized by extremists. In Moscow, the defence ministry had no comment.  12.55pm GMT  BREAKING: Ukraine's State Border Guard says coast guard base surrounded by about 30 Russian marines.  12.39pm GMT  Andriy Paruby, Ukraine’s top security official, has accused the Kremlin on Friday of commanding armed groups in Crimea. Commenting on the alleged take over of two airports, the secretary of the National Security and Defence Council told a televised briefing in Kiev: These are separate groups ... commanded by the Kremlin. He claimed similar actions had been prevented elsewhere in Ukraine, adding that Ukraine could not deploy military forces in Crimea without introducing a state of emergency.  12.32pm GMT  The Ukrainian border guard service said that more than 10 Russian military helicopters flew from Russia into Ukrainian airspace over the Crimea region on Friday. Earlier video footage emerged purporting to be of Russian helicopters near Sevestopol. The guard service also said in a statement that Russian servicemen were blocking off a unit of Ukrainian border guards in Sevastopol, where part of the Russian Black Sea fleet is based.

A spokesman said: The situation in Crimea will require a political solution and this can only be achieved via dialogue amongst the different parties involved. We want all relevant actors, all parties to be as moderate and restrained as possible ... and to respect the integrity and unity of Ukraine.  12.18pm GMT  My colleague Paul Owen provides this summary of events so far today: •  Ukraine has accused Russia of carrying out an “armed invasion” after men in military uniform seized Simferopol airport in the largely pro-Russian Crimea region of the country. Reporters at the airport have pointed out similarities with the new Russian army uniform. The airport seems to be running normally. •  Russian forces have also blocked Sevastopol military airport, also in Crimea, Ukraine’s new interim government has claimed. But Russia’s Black Sea fleet, which is based in Sevastapol, has denied it has taken action at Sevastopol. However, it said it had stepped up measures by its “anti-terror units” to protect areas where parts of the fleet are located.  The airport seizures come the day after pro-Russian gunmen took over the Crimean parliament. •  Ukraine’s parliament is asking the UN security council to call a session to consider the country’s current problems. It has also urged Russia to stop moves which it says undermine Ukrainian territorial integrity. •  Ukraine’s acting president Oleksandr Turchynov has dismissed the chief of staff of the armed forces Yuri Illyin, who was only appointed to the post by the since ousted president Viktor Yanukovych last week. •  Ukraine’s prosecutor has said it will ask Russia to extradite former president Viktor Yanukovych, who is wanted for alleged “mass murder”, if it is confirmed he is in Russia. Yanukovych is to give a press conference from an undisclosed location in Russia at 1pm GMT. • Switzerland, Austria and Lichenstien are all freezing assets of the former Ukrainian government. Only Switzerland named the individuals affected, who included among them ousted Yanukovych and his son Oleksander. Switzerland’s chief prosecutor has also opened a money laundering investigation into Yanukovych and and his son, •  The leader of Russia’s far-right party, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, is in Crimea and on his way to Sevastopol. The controversial Zhirinovsky, who is deputy speaker state Duma speaker said Russia could help south-east Ukraine by providing fuel. •  As fears grow over Ukraine separating, Russian MPs have said that they plan to submit a bill to parliament that would make it easier for new territories to join the Russian Federation.  11.59am GMT  Switzerland and Austria have both announced they are freezing the account of a number of Ukrainians who were involved in the regime that was ousted last week. The Swiss government ordered the freezing of the assets of 20 Ukrainians, including ousted president Viktor Yanukoviych and his son Oleksander, Switzerland’s financial markets authority FINMA said in a statement. Austria has decided to freeze possible bank accounts and assets of 18 Ukrainian citizens in Austria. This has been done on the basis of an official request by the Ukrainian foreign ministry. It did not identify the people affected or say how much wealth was seized.  11.43am GMT  Some gunmen have left Simferopol airport but others remain. 2-3 dozen militiamen at Simferopol #Crimea airport quickly piled into a truck - with no plates - and are leaving. pic.twitter.com/wgcIjvE8jV More militia remain at Simferopol #Crimea airport after departure of a few dozen just now. #Ukraine Reporters at the airport are also pointing out similarities with the new Russian army uniform. New #Russian uniform bears uncanny resemblance to that worn by troops at #Simferopol airport. http://t.co/xoeyvS6HI1  11.35am GMT  Harriet Salem, in Crimea, just ran into Vladimir Zhirinovsky, a controversy-attracting Russian politician, who is leader of the far-right Liberal Democratic party and deputy state Duma speaker. He turned up at the roadblock between Simferopol and Sevastopol and said he was headed to Sevastopol. He said: Russia will help the economic situation in the south-east. We can provide fuel and gas at a cheap price. The [military] manoeuvres in Russia were normal, they were nothing special. Crimea should decide its future for itself. We Russians don’t want to create the impression we will ‘take’ Crimea. Yanukovych is the lawful president by the constitution and the only one who can sign a decree.  11.22am GMT  Meanwhile, Ukraine’s prosecutor has said it will ask Russia to extradite Viktor Yanukovych, who is wanted for alleged “mass murder”, if it is confirmed he is in Russia. Need I say that it is highly unlikely Russia will comply.  11.18am GMT  As we wait to hear from ousted Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych, who is due to give a press conference from Russia at 1pm GMT , a Swiss prosecutor has opened a money laundering investigation into him and and his son Oleksander, Reuters reports. A statement from the prosecutor’s office in Geneva said: A penal investigation for severe money laundering is currently being conducted in Geneva against Viktor Yanukovich and his son Oleksander. It said prosecutor Yves Bertossa and the police had searched the office of a company owned by Oleksander Yanukovych on Thursday morning and seized some documents. Switzerland yesterday it would order banks to freeze any funds in Swiss banks found to be linked any Yanukovych funds.  11.07am GMT  Ukraine’s acting president Oleksandr Turchynov has dismissed the chief of staff of the armed forces Yuri Illyin, who was only appointed to the post by the since ousted president Viktor Yanukovych last week. No reason was given for his dismissal in a brief statement on the presidential website. Interfax Ukraine reports that Turchynov has also dismissed Volodymyr Sivkovych as deputy secretary of the national security and defence council. Updated at 11.08am GMT  10.53am GMT  This video purportedly shows a group of military helicopters flying towards Sevastopol airport today. Refat Chubarov, the leader of the Crimean Tartars, who support the new government in Ukraine, claimed they came from Russia. The Guardian cannot independently verify this footage. Updated at 10.55am GMT  10.44am GMT  The ousted president Viktor Yanukovych, wanted for alleged “mass murder” in Ukraine, is giving a press conference from Russia later, from a secret location.

She told me: On the road between Sevastopol and Simferopol there was a roadblock but they were letting most people through with Crimean number plates. A sign at the roadblock read “People who live by the sword…” but the second half was missing A man at Sevastopol airport, who said he was a captain in the tactical aviation brigade in Sevastopol but declined to give his name, told the Guardian there were about 300 people of unknown identity inside the airport but he said, without elaborating: “We don’t consider it any invasion of our territory.” He said the men looked like military, were wearing two different types of uniform, and were armed with sniper rifles and AK-47s. “We don’t know who they are, nor where they’ve come from” he said He also said that there were two Kamaz (a manufacturer of trucks) vehicles inside. “They [the vehicles] looked like they could contain 50 people at a push so how they got 300 people inside, I don’t know,” he said Major Fidorenko from the Ukrainian military at the base at the airport said they’d been in touch with the unknown gunmen who said they were there “to prevent unwanted landings of helicopters and planes”. There were reports earlier that the gunmen at Simferopol wanted to stop Ukraine’s new interior minister Arsen Avakov and Ukrainian security council head Valentyn Nalyvaichenko from arriving in Crimea.  9.59am GMT  In response to a question on Twitter, the US ambassador to Ukraine, Geoff Pyatt, has said Russia and Europe have “a shared interest in a stable Ukraine”. @leonidragozin We're convinced Russia & US have a shared interest in a stable Ukraine As Minister Avakov said this is a job for us diplomats  9.40am GMT  The UK foreign office has updated its travel advice for Ukraine , warning British nationals not to try to leave from Simferopol airport “until the situation becomes clearer”. It says: Armed men are reported to have seized Simferopol airport early on 28 February. Although the airport is reportedly operating as usual, we do not advise British nationals to try to leave from there until the situation becomes clearer. Sevastopol (Belbek) airport is also reported to be blocked by military and flights are not operating. RT @volodarorg : Now at Simferopol airport pic.twitter.com/Rwmb0ef4Sc  #Ukraine  #Crimea  9.20am GMT  As fears grow over Ukraine separating, Russian MPs have said that they plan to submit a bill to parliament that would make it easier for new territories to join the Russian Federation. Mikhail Yemelyanov, a leader of the A Just Russia party, cited the “unpredictable” situation in Ukraine as the reason behind the move, which would allow a territory would be able to join the Russian Federation on the basis of a referendum or a decision of its parliament. Radio Free Europe says that Russia’s “Kommersant” currently requires “the mutual consent of the Russian Federation and this foreign state,” confirmed by an international treaty.  8.54am GMT  Ukraine’s parliament is asking the UN security council to call a session to consider the country’s current problems. It has also urged Russia to stop moves which it says undermine Ukrainian territorial integrity.  8.37am GMT  More on the response from Russia’s Black Sea fleet to accusations that it has taken over or blocked the military airport near Sevastopol. In a statement, it said: No units of the Black Sea fleet were deployed in the area of Belbek nor did they take place in blockading it. But it said it had stepped up measures by its “anti-terror units” to protect areas where parts of the fleet were located in Crimea and the living quarters of service personnel and families “given the unstable situation”.  8.33am GMT  Ukraine’s acting president Oleksandr Turchynov has called an emergency session of his security chiefs on the events in Crimea and has accused Russian forces of involvement in “escalation” of the situation there.  8.26am GMT  Ukraine’s economy minister Pavlo Sheremeta told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme what was happening in Crimea was “absolutely unacceptable”. Asked about the possible use of force in Crimea, he said: At the moment I do not see any discussion of using the force but ....if we need to use the force to protect the territorial integrity of the country - we would rather avoid it, of course - but the integrity of the country will be kept for sure. He said “the first option is communication” and that the Ukrainian government was already talking to its Russian counterpart.  8.19am GMT  Russia’s Black Sea fleet says its forces have not seized or taken any action at the airport near Sevastopol, close to its naval base, Interfax is reporting.  8.12am GMT  The chairman of Russia’s state Duma, Sergey Naryshkin, has proposed asking the Venice Commission , the Council of Europe’s advisory body on constitutional matters, to assess the legitimacy of Ukraine’s new government, Interfax Russia is reporting.

The airport’s departure board is listing two flights - to Kiev and Moscow - as having departed this morning with the gate closed for another flight to Kiev, although it appears to be somewhat delayed, having been scheduled to leave at 7.20am local time this morning. The Interfax Ukraine report says: Some reports suggest that these people came to the airport because they thought that an airplane carrying some protest forces had landed there. Other theories indicate that they wanted to stop Ukraine’s new interior minister Arsen Avakov and Ukrainian security council head Valentyn Nalyvaichenko from arriving in Crimea.  7.48am GMT  What is the Russian foreign ministry’s response to the accusations levelled by the Ukrainian interior minister about the takeover of two airports in Crimea?

"NSA files - Guardian has done 'considerable public service', says Vince Cable","Jemima Kiss ,  Paul Owen and  Matthew Weaver  Fri 11 Oct 2013 16.54 BST    First published on Mon 30 Sep 2013 12.50 BST     4.54pm BST  Thanks for all your comments this week and last week. This blog will continue on Monday on a new page . Updated at 10.51am BST  3.27pm BST  George Howarth, a Labour member of the parliamentary intelligence and security committee , which monitors the security services, has just been speaking to BBC News. He said the public was “rightly concerned” about the question of “who controls, who knows about [the state's] secrets” and suggested the state might have to “justify all over again why it is that the state does require that we have secrets”. Later in the autumn the heads of the security services will be addressing the committee. Howarth suggested the chiefs might “speculate as to what further safeguards can be put into place” at the hearing. The public hearing would be important although the agency heads would not be able to speak totally freely, he said, adding: Maybe we need to justify all over again why it is that the state does require that we have secrets. And if you have secrets, who controls, who knows about those secrets. These are big, important questions, and I know they’re ones they’ll grapple with, the heads of the agencies, but we as a democracy, whether we’re parliamentarians on the intelligence and security committee, in the government, or just members of the public, are rightly concerned about [them]. Howarth also returned the debate to Snowden’s revelations of government surveillance in the US and UK themselves, saying: Where is the balance between on the one hand the state’s need to know who’s doing what that might lead to harm to the people who live here … set against the civil liberties of people and the reasonable expectation that their communications aren’t going to be monitored to no useful purpose? Asked his view of where this balance should lie, he said: What we looked at, in terms of the information-sharing that takes place between the National Security Agency [NSA] and GCHQ , our own agency, we found no evidence … of any wrongdoing. They behaved within the law. Authorisations have been properly obtained before any particular information has been accessed. So we start from a position where nobody’s actually breaking the law at the moment. The next question that arises, in terms of reassuring people that their privacy will be properly protected, is: “What safeguards are there in place, legally, to ensure that those communications aren’t tampered with in any way, improperly or in any way unethically?” And we’re at the point now I think where we need to think about that. I haven’t got a particular prescription at this stage. I’ve got an open mind. But it’s something our committee do want to look at. Updated at 4.00pm BST  2.43pm BST  Guardian deputy editor Paul Johnson points us to this interview with Jack Straw from last year, in which he discussed selling the serialisation of his memoir to the Daily Mail, saying: If I had that many qualms, I would have tried to block the sale. So the answer is 'no'. I realise this is a crime before the people's court, but I've got a lot of respect for Paul Dacre. I've known him for over 40 years [he and the Mail's editor were contemporaries at Leeds]. I've found him straight and he's a good journalist. 'I've got a lot of respect for Paul Dacre. I've found him straight and he's a good journalist.' Jack Straw http://t.co/tHm7rlxYcc Updated at 2.47pm BST  2.37pm BST  Yesterday David Cameron said that "if people want to suggest improvements about how they [the security services] are governed and looked after I am very happy to listen to those, but as far as I can see we have a very good system". Campaigners writing under the banner of civil liberties group Big Brother Watch have taken him at his word and produced a list of "just a few of the well-established proposals to improve the operation, scrutiny and safeguards of surveillance powers". These are to: • Commission independent, post-legislative scrutiny of the Regulation of Investigative Powers Act 2000 and the Intelligence Services Act 1994, legislation that covers much internet surveillance but was written years before Facebook existed and when few households had internet access. If Parliament intends to allow the collection of data from every internet communication, it should expressly say so in primary legislation, covering both metadata and content • Publish, as the US Government has done, legal opinions that are used to underpin the ongoing surveillance framework • Allow the Intelligence and Security Committee to report to Parliament, and be chaired by an opposition MP, as called for by Lord King. It should also be able to employ technical experts to assist its work. • Publish the budget and investigatory capacity of the ISC, Interception of Communications Commissioner and Surveillance Commissioners • Reform the Investigatory Powers Tribunal so there is a presumption its hearings are held publicly, that it should state reasons for reaching its decisions and that its judgements can be appealed in court • End the need for Secretaries of State to approve appearances of the heads of agencies before Parliamentary committees, and allow agency and service heads to give evidence in public where appropriate • Establish an independent body to review the work of the agencies, as President Obama has done with the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, and ensure it has staff with relevant technical expertise • Lift any legal restrictions on British companies from publishing transparency reports about surveillance requests • Publish details of the use of surveillance powers broken down by agency, as opposed to the single UK figure currently published, including the scale of international intelligence sharing • Enhance whistleblower protection for those who wish to come forward from within the services Updated at 2.48pm BST  2.22pm BST  Sir Francis Richards, a former GCHQ director, was also speaking on BBC Radio 4's The World at One. He suggested that oversight of the intelligence agencies could be improved and raised concerns that a former foreign secretary, Sir Malcolm Rifkind, was chairman of the intelligence and security committee. Richards said: Public confidence in the agency is absolutely vital, they can't operate without it. If they don't have confidence, if the public doesn't have confidence, in the oversight mechanisms that we have then clearly we need to ask ourselves how they can be improved. For a start, I think it's probably not a very good idea that a former senior minister in a Conservative government is the current chair of the intelligence and security committee. Rifkind said that was an "entirely reasonable" point of view but added that, unsurprisingly, he did not share it. "We are completely bipartisan," he told the programme. "We are now responsible for deciding whether the intelligence agencies ever do anything dumb or stupid or illegal and, if they do, we are prepared to be very, very brutal with them." Updated at 2.49pm BST  2.09pm BST  Nicholas Watt has more details of the No 10 spokesman's comments on the system of oversight for the security services. Despite Vince Cable confirming that Clegg was setting in train an examination of the oversight of Britain's intelligence agencies, No 10 said David Cameron was satisfied with the current system. But the prime minister's spokesman added that members of the national security council, of which Nick Clegg is a member, were entitled to question the intelligence agencies. The spokesman said: There is a debate that is outside of government that is often reported in [ the Guardian ] and other newspapers . There is the scope for members of the national security council, privy councillors, to ask questions and the like to better understand the work that the agencies do. That is always open to them. Asked whether the government was setting up a review into the oversight of the agencies, the spokesman said: "There is not a government review in the way that you described – correct. There is no government review."  1.59pm BST  Nigel Inkster, a former assistant chief of MI6, told Radio 4's The World at One at lunchtime that he understood there was a "real possibility" that people could have been put at risk as a result of the leaked information. Inkster said: I don't know and I'm not sure that anybody knows entirely exactly how much material Edward Snowden stole from the NSA systems but it is clearly a massive amount of material, it seems to have been done on a pretty indiscriminate basis and there are, I think, quite convincing indications that there is an awful lot of operational detail there about ongoing activities which risk being compromised because of what he has done. Apart from that, what you have is the revelation of some very complex, sophisticated and expensive-to-develop generic capabilities. Inkster claimed that terrorist groups would now be much more aware of communications vulnerabilities and have a much better capacity to assess the risks. "Assessing the damage and working out how to mitigate that damage I think is going to be a major task and I'm not even sure if it will ever be fully completed," he said. Updated at 2.56pm BST  1.48pm BST  Skype is being investigated by Luxembourg 's data protection commissioner over concerns about its secret involvement with the US National Security Agency ( NSA ) spy programme Prism , Ryan Gallagher reports . The Microsoft -owned internet chat company could potentially face criminal and administrative sanctions, including a ban on passing users' communications covertly to the US signals intelligence agency. Skype itself is headquartered in the European country, and could also be fined if an investigation concludes that the data sharing is found in violation of the country's data-protection laws. The Guardian understands that Luxembourg's data-protection commissioner initiated a probe into Skype's privacy policies following revelations in June about its ties to the NSA. Meanwhile, the founder of Lavabit, the email service used by Edward Snowden, has filed the opening brief in his appeal against a court order forcing him to turn over the keys to his secure email service’s encryption. Read the full story here.  1.40pm BST  Jack Straw’s backing for unquestioned (by the press) support for the security services is part of a more complicated relationship he has had with MI5 – who started spying on his family when he was only 15. In his autobiography, Last Man Standing , he tells how he and his family came under intense surveillance, which he first learned about when he was vetted to be Barbara Castle’s adviser at the DHSS in 1974. A man “with a skin disease” from the MoD interviewed him for six hours suggesting that he was gay – Straw says the spooks were “obsessed” with homosexuals at the time. He was called back for a third interview with MI5, who had a two-inch thick file on him and his family. Straw was questioned about his sister, Suzy, whom they believed, on the evidence of a neighbour, to be a member of the Communist party. The spook showed Straw a memo from someone who had been spying on his sister. Straw told them it was a mistake. His sister had merely fancied a member of the CP. He was then questioned about leftwing contemporaries while he had been President of the National Union of Students. He was confronted with detailed evidence from someone who had spied on a lunch he and another student had had in a pub years earlier – including a detailed account of their conversations. At the end of the meeting the spook asked Straw not to tell Barbara Castle about their meeting. Straw readily agreed. “On the way back to the DHSS I reflected on the fact that the Security Service had begun to put together this file on my family when I was 15 – and on the scale of the surveillance operation this implied.” Most people might have been troubled by this. Not Straw. He writes that he was “neither surprised nor shocked … This was the world we lived in.” So Straw is at least consistent. He didn’t mind himself, his family, his sister or his friends being put under close surveillance. And he doesn’t mind it for the rest of us, either.  12.29pm BST  In contrast to Vince Cable’s comments, former Labour home secretary Jack Straw has hit out at the Guardian over the Snowden leaks. Straw said Guardian journalists’ “almost adolescent excitement” had gone to their heads. I think that the head of the security service, MI5, has been absolutely right to say what he has said, and I regret what I can only describe as indulgent, irresponsibility by the Guardian newspaper. You can always justify everything, if you’re a newspaper, on the grounds that this is open journalism, but this is about much more than journalism, it’s genuinely about how we protect the national interest. And that’s not just about protecting the ‘establishment’, it’s about keeping people safe, it’s about avoiding another 7th of July 2005. Asked if the revelations have risked lives, Straw said: Well, potentially. I’m not suggesting for a moment that anybody at the Guardian gratuitously wants to risk anybody’s life. But what I do think is there sense of power of having these ‘secrets’ and excitement, almost adolescent excitement, about these secrets, has gone to their head and they’re blinding themselves about the consequence, and also showing an extraordinary naivety and arrogance in implying that they are in a position to judge whether or not particularly secrets which they publish are or are not likely to damage the national interest. And they’re not in any position at all to do that. Updated at 12.30pm BST  12.26pm BST  The BBC has just quoted a No 10 spokesman as denying that there is a government review of the security services, as Clegg’s aides and Cable have suggested. The prime minister thinks the current system is good, the BBC reported the spokesman as saying. He said it was open to members of the National Security Council and the privy council to ask the security agencies questions. He said David Cameron was prepared to listen to the ideas of others.  11.50am BST  The first verified photograph of Edward Snowden in Russia since he left Moscow’s Sheremetyevo Airport emerged yesterday, showing the former NSA contractor meeting four former US government officials, who presented him with an award for "integrity in intelligence". Shaun Walker in Moscow writes : The four former US government officials who met Snowden said he was in good spirits and dismissed claims that he was in any way restricted by the Russian government. He was presented with the Sam Adams award for integrity in intelligence, which has been given yearly since 2002, when it was award to Coleen Rowley, the former FBI agent who before the 9/11 attacks denounced the agency's failure to investigate suggestions that Islamist militants were targeting the US. In 2010, the award was given to WikiLeaks and Julian Assange. "He spoke very openly about a whole range of things, a number of which I won't get into here, but it certainly didn't involve any kind of manipulation by the Russian government or anyone else for that matter," Jesselyn Radack, formerly of the US justice department and now with an organisation that protects whistleblowers, told the Associated Press. "He definitely is his own person and makes his own decisions and says and does what he wants to." She and others present at the meeting refused to disclose where it had taken place. The award is named aftera CIA whistleblower during the Vietnam War , rather than the US Founding Father of the same name.  11.24am BST  Today’s Guardian cryptic crossword has a surveillance theme, with questions including “Finally witnessing US vice leads to Edward Snowden making judgement (5)” and “PRISM, for example, is old scheme (5)”. Setter Arachne tells me there is also “an appropriate message hidden in the peripheral squares”.  11.00am BST  Sir Andrew Parker’s comments earlier this week sparked criticism of the Guardian from rightwing media and politicians. But significant voices from across the political, cultural and academic spectrum, as well as experts in privacy and security, in Britain, the United States, and elsewhere, have acknowledged that genuine issues have been raised by the Guardian’s revelations that do need to be discussed. Here the Guardian rounds up some of the key responses , starting with James Clapper, the director of US national intelligence, who said: “ As loath as I am to give any credit to what's happened here, I think it's clear that some of the conversations this has generated, some of the debate, actually needed to happen.” In June, after the first Guardian revelations, Barack Obama said he welcomed a debate on the subject : You’ll remember when I made that speech a couple of weeks ago about the need for us to shift out of a perpetual war mindset. I specifically said that one of the things that we’re going to have to discuss and debate is how were we striking this balance between the need to keep the American people safe and our concerns about privacy, because there are some trade-offs involved. And I welcome this debate. And I think it’s healthy for our democracy. I think it’s a sign of maturity, because probably five years ago, six years ago, we might not have been having this debate. And I think it’s interesting that there are some folks on the left, but also some folks on the right who are now worried about it who weren’t very worried about it when it was a Republican president. I think that’s good that we’re having this discussion. But I think it’s important for everybody to understand, and I think the American people understand, that there are some trade-offs involved. You know, I came in with a health skepticism about these programs. My team evaluated them. We scrubbed them thoroughly. We actually expanded some of the oversight, increased some of the safeguards. But my assessment and my team’s assessment was that they help us prevent terrorist attacks. And the modest encroachments on privacy that are involved in getting phone numbers or duration without a name attached and not looking at content — that on, you know, net, it was worth us doing. That’s — some other folks may have a different assessment of that. But I think it’s important to recognize that you can’t have a hundred percent security and also then have a hundred percent privacy and zero inconvenience. You know, we’re going to have to make some choices as a society. And — (audio break) — I can say is, is that in evaluating these programs, they make a difference — (audio break) — to anticipate and prevent possible terrorist activity. And the fact that they’re under very strict supervision by all three branches of government and that they do not involve listening to people’s phone calls, do not involve reading the emails of U.S. citizens or U.S. residents, absent further action by a federal court, that is entirely consistent with what we would do, for example, in a criminal investigation. I think, on balance, we — you know, we have established a process and a procedure that the American people should feel comfortable about. But again, this — these programs are subject to congressional oversight and congressional reauthorization and congressional debate. And if there are members of Congress who feel differently, then they should speak up. And we’re happy to have that debate. Updated at 11.28am BST  10.41am BST  My colleagues in our Sydney office have been speaking to the editors of the Australian press , who also back the Guardian's decision to publish. Garry Linnell of Fairfax Media writes: To pass off the Guardian’s reporting of the NSA as helping “Britain’s enemies” is, at first glance, comical and would usually be consigned to the closest dustbin. But at a deeper level it hints at a profound and alarming complacency about the roles of media and government. Hell, let’s not ask questions at all. Let’s not scrutinise those with the power and ability to carry out widespread surveillance on their own citizens. Let’s keep the public in the dark, rather than serving their right to know. And when the state acts unlawfully, let us look the other way. Then we will truly have the society our enemies wish upon us.  9.56am BST  The Guardian showed the Daily Mail’s leader describing it as “the paper that helps Britain’s enemies” to many of the world’s leading editors. Here are their responses . Among them is Wolfgang Buechner of Germany’s Der Spiegel, who writes that while it is understandable that the governments of the UK and US might not be pleased by the Guardian’s revelations, it is “a tragedy that media outlets aligned with governments are now accusing the journalists uncovering these abuses of ‘lethal irresponsibility’.” Javier Moreno of Spain’s El Pais says: What is sad, baffling and dangerous is that the attacks now come not only from governments but from other newspapers too. In doing so, they are ignoring their first and utmost obligation. The press must serve the citizens and comply with their right to have access to truthful and relevant informations when it comes to public affairs. Siddharth Varadarajan of India’s the Hindu writes: Those attacking the media on the NSA issue wilfully ignore the fact that what the Guardian, the New York Times, the Hindu and other newspapers around the world have published so far are details of snooping that is not even remotely related to fighting terrorism. Osama bin Laden did not need Edward Snowden's revelations about Prism to realise the US was listening in to every bit of electronic communication: he had already seceded from the world of telephony and reverted to couriers. But millions of people in the US, the UK, Brazil, India and elsewhere, including national leaders, energy companies and others who are being spied upon for base reasons, were unaware of the fact that their privacy was being compromised. Frank Schirrmacher of Germany’s Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung says: “There is no indication whatsoever that those media organisations who reported about the NSA and GCHQ files have endangered our national security.” And Jill Abramson of the New York Times writes: The accurate and in-depth news articles published by the New York Times and the Guardian help inform the public in framing its thinking about these issues and deciding how to balance the need to protect against terrorism and to protect individual privacy . Vigorous news coverage and spirited public debate are both in the public interest. The journalists at the New York Times and the Guardian care deeply about the wellbeing and safety of their fellow citizens in carrying out their role in keeping the public informed. Read their responses, and those of many other editors from around the world, here .  9.39am BST  Cable was just interviewed on the BBC News channel and asked about the Guardian NSA revelations. I think we’ve got to separate out the two things. There’s the Guardian acting as a newspaper, bringing things to public attention, things that shouldn’t have happened that did happen, and they’ve brought that out. That’s their role, and they’ve done that very well and courageously. But the other issue is about Mr Snowden’s own behaviour. Likening that to the Cambridge spy ring [ as Sir David Omand, No 10’s former security adviser, has ] is frankly somewhat bizarre. I mean they were acting covertly over a long period of time. This was a whistleblower acting very publically. I mean there is a question about sensitive intelligence he put into the wrong hands. That will obviously have to be pursued. It was put to Cable that he was saying it was wrong to leak secret information but right to publish it. The business secretary replied: I think there is a distinction between whistleblowing to draw the public’s attention to things happening in the intelligence world that shouldn’t have been happening - absolutely right - and actually putting into the hands of other people a lot of very very detailed intelligence information which they shouldn’t have had. I think it is an important distinction and I think most people would understand that.  9.31am BST  My colleagues Nicholas Watt, Patrick Wintour, Rowena Mason and Dan Roberts have the full story on Vince Cable’s comments on the Guardian’s Snowden stories. Here are the key points: Cable said: I think the Guardian has done a very considerable public service … The conclusion which Nick Clegg came to, and set out this morning, is that we do need to have proper political oversight of the intelligence services and arguably we haven't until now. What they [the Guardian] did was, as journalists, entirely correct and right. Mr Snowden is a different kettle of fish.  9.20am BST  There is a new round of attacks against the Guardian and its coverage of Edward Snowden's leaks in sections of the British press today. The Daily Mail writes: "There are growing demands for an inquiry into whether the Guardian could be prosecuted for publishing top-secret files." The demands come from Tory MP Julian Smith, as detailed here yesterday , and Professor Anthony Glees of the Centre for Security and Intelligence Studies at the University of Buckingham, who says that Sir Andrew Parker of MI5 clearly believed the UK’s security had been damaged. He is quoted as saying: If that is the case, a prosecution under the Official Secrets Act should follow. It is not clear to me why that has not happened and I suspect it is not clear to the director-general [Parker] either. The paper puts together a 14-point "charge sheet" against the Guardian or "the newspaper that puts Britain's spies in danger". The Times publishes an interview with S ir David Omand , No 10's former security adviser, in which he claims Snowden's leaks have been more damaging to Britain's intelligence services than the Cambridge spies during the Cold War. "It’s the most catastrophic loss to British intelligence ever, much worse than [Guy] Burgess and [Donald] MacLean in the 50s,” he says. Like the Mail, it also quotes Anthony Glees saying it is not clear to him why the Guardian has not been prosecuted under the Official Secrets Act for undermining national security . The Sun covers the story under the headline: " Prosecute Guardian for aiding terrorists ", leading on Julian Smith's comments. The Daily Telegraph says "the political backlash against the Guardian over the Edward Snowden leaks" is growing, citing criticism from Nick Clegg, Theresa May and David Cameron. They all said they shared the concerns of Andrew Parker, MI5 director general, who earlier this week said the revelations over intelligence techniques had been a “gift” to the terrorists.  9.11am BST  The Guardian today reports aides to the deputy prime minister as saying that Nick Clegg will be calling in experts from inside and outside Whitehall to discuss the implications of the new surveillance technologies for public accountability and trust. Clegg is to start conversations in government about how to update the legal oversight of the UK's security services in the light of disclosures by the Guardian , the paper reports. It is the first time such a senior figure in government has conceded that the revelations published in the Guardian have highlighted concerns about the accountability of the security services. And on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme this morning Vince Cable, the business secretary and Clegg’s Lib Dem colleague, defended the paper. Vince Cable:I think Guardian has done a v considerable public service What they did as journalists entirely correct + right More details soon ... Updated at 9.12am BST  5.12pm BST  That's it from us for today. Join us again tomorrow.  4.06pm BST  The BBC's Gordon Corera has spoken to the NSA deputy director Chris Ingli s today, who insisted that the NSA "is committed to showing that we are not Big Brother". "I do think there needs to be more transparency," Mr Inglis told the BBC. "We've had a discussion many times across the summer about the need to perhaps rebalance the balance between national security and civil liberties," he said. "I don't think that is the case. I think that both of those must be given equal and full support. I don't think that we trade one for the other. "But I do think we have to consider the balance between secrecy and transparency in order to have the public's confidence or [that of] those who stand in the shoes of the public and act on their behalf, say in the Congress," Mr Inglis added. "There needs to be greater transparency and we are committed to that." ... "I can appreciate that people are nervous," Mr Inglis said. "And we ourselves at NSA need to respect that and therefore offer up whatever is necessary in terms of transparency to secure the confidence of our overseers and beyond them the American public - and for that matter allies."  3.31pm BST  In related news, a report published on Thursday said Barack Obama had pursued the most aggressive "war on leaks" since the Nixon administration, and said the administration's attempts to control the flow of information was hampering the ability of journalists to do their jobs . The author of the study, the former Washington Post executive editor Leonard Downie, says the administration's actions have severely hindered the release of information that could be used to hold it to account. Downie, an editor during the Post's investigations of Watergate, acknowledged that Obama had inherited a culture of secrecy that had built up since 9/11. But despite promising to be more open, Obama had become "more aggressive", stepping up the Espionage Act to pursue those accused of leaking classified information. Glenn Greenwald has written about the same report . He writes: Back in 2006, back when I was writing frequently about the Bush administration's attacks on press freedom , the focus was on mere threats to take some of these actions, and that caused severe anger from vocal progressives. Now, as this new report documents, we have moved well beyond the realm of mere threats into undeniable reality, and the silence is as deafening as the danger is pronounced. Updated at 4.29pm BST  3.28pm BST  Rowena Mason sends more from David Cameron earlier today. The prime minister did not deny former energy secretary Chris Huhne's allegations that the council was not briefed. He said: Anyone on the National Security Council is fully able to go and speak with the intelligence agencies, quiz them about the work that they do, to ask for presentations. As prime minister I've been to Cheltenham to see what GCHQ do ... I meet regularly with the head of MI5 to discuss his work. Any member of the national security council, frankly any member of the cabinet is able ... to get access to this information and they are able to go and have those conversations. Cameron was also asked whether people should read the Guardian after it published the Snowden leaks. He said: "People can read any newspaper they want. There are days when I recommend reading absolutely no newspaper at all." Updated at 3.29pm BST  2.28pm BST  My colleague Rowena Mason was with Cameron in York and she reports that the prime minister also said he was open to suggestions about how the security services could be better governed. Rowena reports: Asked why the National Security Council was not told about GCHQ's secret surveillance programmes Tempora and Prism, Cameron said ministers were free to ask any questions they wanted of the UK's spying chiefs. He defended oversight of the security services but said he was "happy to listen" to suggestions about how it could be improved. "I am satisfied the work these agencies do is not only vital but it is properly overseen," he said. "That is what this debate needs to be about. Do we want to have well funded intelligent services that help keep people safe? "If people want to suggest improvements about how they are governed and looked after I am very happy to listen to those, but as far as I can see we have a very good system." Updated at 3.29pm BST  1.59pm BST  David Cameron has today spoken out personally about the Guardian/MI5 debate, rather than, as yesterday, through his spokesman. The prime minister said newspapers that revealed vast amounts of security information needed to "think about their responsibilities" and whether they were helping to keep the country safe. Speaking on a visit to York, Cameron said the Guardian had shown "understanding" when it had agreed to destroy hard drives: I think our intelligence and security services do a very good job of keeping us safe. Every year since I've been prime minister there has been one or two major plots that could have led to huge loss of life in our country and we rely on the intelligence services to help keep us safe. But when you get newspapers who get hold of vast amounts of data and information, which is effectively stolen information, and they think it's OK to reveal this, I think they have to think about their responsibilities and are they helping to keep our country safe. To be fair to the Guardian, when I sent the cabinet secretary to tell them about how dangerous it was to hold this information, they agreed to have a whole lot of it destroyed. The Guardian's decision to destroy computer hard drives was taken after a threat of legal action by the government that could have stopped reporting on the extent of American and British government surveillance revealed by the documents. The editor of the Guardian, Alan Rusbridger, had earlier informed government officials that other copies of the files existed outside the country and that the Guardian was neither the sole recipient nor steward of the files leaked by Snowden. But the government insisted that the material be either destroyed or surrendered. As Julian Borger reported in August: The Guardian's lawyers believed the government might either seek an injunction under the law of confidence, a catch-all statute that covers any unauthorised possession of confidential material, or start criminal proceedings under the Official Secrets Act. Either brought with it the risk that the Guardian's reporting would be frozen everywhere and that the newspaper would be forced to hand over material. "I explained to British authorities that there were other copies in America and Brazil so they wouldn't be achieving anything," Rusbridger said. "But once it was obvious that they would be going to law I preferred to destroy our copy rather than hand it back to them or allow the courts to freeze our reporting." Updated at 2.07pm BST  1.40pm BST  Here is a short clip of Edward Snowden's father Lon arriving in Moscow in the hope of visiting his son.  12.54pm BST  An MP has asked the government to clarify that the Guardian has not broken the law by “sending detailed family information and personal information about security agents across borders”. Conservative MP Julian Smith (Skipton and Ripon) told the leader of the Commons, Andrew Lansley: As part of its reporting on national security issues, the Guardian newspaper has not denied sending detailed family information and personal information about security agents across borders. This is illegal, it's threatening our agents and their families. Please can we have a statement from the home secretary to clarify that the law will be upheld whether or not the organisation involved is hiding behind the fig-leaf of journalism. Lansley said he would ask Theresa May to consider Smith's comments and added that the head of MI5 was "absolutely right" to say the Guardian's disclosures about British intelligence agency mass surveillance programmes were a "gift" to terrorists. He called on the Guardian to "exercise its own accountability" over the stories. He added: I think the house knows that the freedom of speech which we all so highly prize comes with a responsibility and I think the members of the house and the public will have been very struck by what it was that the director-general of MI5 said during the course of this week and I'm sure he was absolutely right to say it. In that context if I may I will ask the home secretary to consider the point you raise and how she might inform the house in due course. But it does seem to me that regardless of any action that is taken by government, it is incumbent on the press, the Guardian in this context, to exercise its own accountability for the decisions that they have made. After Glenn Greenwald’s partner David Miranda was detained in August, the Metropolitan police announced a criminal investigation into the material taken from him at Heathrow airport. Updated at 1.01pm BST  12.41pm BST  While Lord Justice Leveson speaks about press regulation to the Commons select committee this morning, here's how the UK's newspapers look. Following MI5 chief Andrew Parker's comments that Snowden's leaks had undermined the fight against terrorism, the Daily Mail led today with ' PM backs spy chief's attack on Guardian ', which it names ' the paper that helps Britain's enemies ': David Cameron yesterday joined the attacks on the Guardian for publishing secret files that have put national security at risk. The Prime Minister threw his full weight behind MI5 director-general Andrew Parker who has warned the leaks are a ‘gift’ to terrorists. MPs and security experts weighed in too, claiming the newspaper had exposed the UK’s intelligence secrets to Islamist fanatics and foreign spies. Roy Greenslade pointed out that just last week, Mail executives asked that the headline and copy of a story should be read together: Applying their helpful advice on how to read newspapers, I was careful to read today's Mail splash headline, "PM backs spy chief's attack on Guardian" , in company with the copy... It would have been very odd if a British prime minister showed the least sign of disagreement with a speech by the head of the British internal security services. So it is hard to imagine a No 10 spokesman saying anything else. But does it amount to a direct criticism by the PM of The Guardian? The Mail continued with a leader, and column by Stephen Glover , referencing comments by deputy national security adviser Oliver Robbins: Mr Robbins has previously suggested that these documents, which have probably been replicated many times, are so sensitive that British agents have had to be moved for their own safety. These are grave charges. The Guardian is being accused of putting at risk not only the lives of agents but also potentially the lives of ordinary British people, whom MI5 will now find it more difficult to protect. Divide the accusations in two, and then halve them again, and they are still mind-boggling. And the holy trinity was completed by Douglas Murray of the Henry Jackson Society: Endless effort has been put in by The Guardian to prove otherwise, but in vain. What the newspaper has indulged in over this Snowden affair truly IS a ‘gift’ to terrorists as well as to every one of this country’s enemies – and all because of the schoolboy vanity of a few left-wing journalists. The Daily Telegraph picked up Robbins : Oliver Robbins said the Edward Snowden revelations, published by the Guardian newspaper, could lead “directly to widespread loss of life” and “threaten the internal stability of the UK”. A senior MP also accused the newspaper and Snowden of being “naïve” if they thought they could identify what parts of the stolen files would damage national security if publicised. The Times reported a professor saying that if national security has been damaged, "a prosecution [at the Guardian] should follow". The Financial Times voices support for the security services, but with supervision: Privately, the spooks use more colourful language about the publication by The Guardian of some of their most precious secrets. We should be both unsettled and reassured by this collision between security and personal freedom. Unsettled, because Mr Snowden’s leaks reveal the vast scope and scale of eavesdropping. Reassured, because we need the secret state; the digital revolution has undercut the capacity of democratic societies to thwart dangerous enemies. More on the Guardian's response below... Updated at 12.56pm BST  12.08pm BST  In the Guardian today, Nicholas Watt, Stuart Millar and Nick Hopkins report on Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger’s defence of the paper’s publication of the Snowden revelations. And Hopkins and Matthew Taylor take five key claims made by Parker in his speech on Tuesday and assess their validity. Here is an extract: "It causes enormous damage to make public the reach and limits of GCHQ techniques. Such information hands the advantage to the terrorists. It is the gift they need to evade us and strike at will." This was the key soundbite of the speech – and it was provocative. But Parker did not provide any details to support the claim, nor can he. His view is the leaks have damaged national security, but the former director of operations and intelligence of MI6, Nigel Inkster, has been more sceptical. "I sense that those most interested in the activities of the NSA and GCHQ have not been told much they didn't already know or could have inferred." In an opinion piece for the New York Times , the security specialist Bruce Schneier said the argument about compromising national security "doesn't even pass the laugh test". Last week, the New York Times reported Snowden's disclosures had caused less damage than another self-inflicted leak. Apparently, there has been a "sharp drop in terrorists' use of a major communications channel" after the US press revealed American spies had intercepted messages between two senior al-Qaida commanders in the Middle East. On his blog , Richard Norton-Taylor, the Guardian’s former defence and security editor, argues that “what GCHQ needs – and MI5 and MI6 – is more effective and credible accountability”. Even serving intelligence chiefs admit privately that the system of Commissioners – normally former senior judges – set up to monitor the activities of the security and intelligence agencies is weak and lacks credibilty. The prime minister-appointed parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee has yet to show itself to be a credible, independent, oversight body. The value of a truly independent inspector was demonstrated the day after Parker delivered his speech.The independent chief inspector of borders and immigration, John Vine, published a detailed report, warts and all, (though with some passages redacted) about the Home Office's flagship "e-borders" programme . In the end, as I have argued before, it is a matter of trust. Legislation helps but it will not always be able to catch up with the development of intrusive technology. A system of credible, full-time, independent inspectors would help. On the comment pages, John Kampfner, the former chief executive of Index on Censorship, attempts to explain the "silence and sneers" from rival newspapers that have greeted the Guardian's Snowden revelations: "Leveson". Most rivals on Fleet Street think this paper has also been selective in its embrace of freedom of expression, siding as it did with advocates of greater regulation of the British press. This is payback time. With so much at stake, one might reasonably (or naively) assume that, whatever their political hue, the media might work collaboratively in challenging the powerful. For as long as the press fails in its core function and for as long as our parliamentarians remain quiescent, the security services can act as they please, accumulating information on all of us they could never have dreamed of. At one point in his speech, Parker asserts: "I too believe strongly that the public is owed an explanation of the threats the country faces and what we are doing about them." How right he is.  11.56am BST  Yesterday Glenn Greenwald, the Guardian journalist who has been most involved with the Snowden revelations, and David Miranda, his partner, spoke to the senate in Brazil , where they live, about the story. Miranda spoke about his detention under a terrorism law, saying it was a ploy to intimidate the newspaper and Greenwald.  11.49am BST  As Andrew Sparrow reports on his politics live blog , both Nick Clegg, Britain’s deputy prime minister, and Theresa May, the home secretary, have spoken out this morning about MI5 chief Sir Andrew Parker’s speech on Tuesday and whether the Guardian was right to publish Edward Snowden’s leaked documents. Clegg said the Guardian was right to launch a debate, but he felt the paper had gone too far in publishing “very technical information” that would only be understood by “technicians amongst the terrorists”. Here are the full quotes: Q: Do you agree with the prime minister who [supports Andrew Parker's warning that] the Guardian's publication of those files handed the advantage to Britain's enemies, it was a guidebook to terrorism, the Edward Snowden story. NC: I certainly agree that if what you end up doing is just basically publishing very technical information that actually most Guardian readers, or most of us, would not frankly understand but the only people who will understand are the technicians amongst the terrorists, then what's the public interest in that? However, I think of course there's a totally legitimate debate to be had about - and my experience speaking to people in the intelligence agencies is that they recognise this - the use of these new, incredibly powerful technologies. We have legislation, regulations, which were designed for an age which is quite different now. And both terrorists and states, and security agencies, now conduct this battle online in a way that was unimaginable a few years ago. And what they means for privacy and proportionality is a totally legitimate area of debate. How you hold the secret parts of any part of any state to account is an incredibly important issue. Because secrecy is necessary, of course it is. You absolutely must defend the principle of secrecy for the intelligence agencies, without which they can't keep us safe. But you can only really make secrecy legitimate in the eyes of the public if there is proper form of accountability. Now, we've improved it. This government has taken big steps - and I'm delighted that we've done this - to strengthen, for instance, the intelligence and security committee, which is the committee which holds the agencies to account in parliament. But I saw a previous head of MI5 say recently to expect the public just to accept that some slightly opaque arrangement in Westminster is the way to hold everyone to account, in which the public does not have much of an insight - I think it's right for us to ask whether there anything more we can do to make sure the public feel that accountability is working in this area properly. Q: But did the Guardian go to far with the level of detail it published? NC: Oh, I've got no doubt that there were some parts of what was published which will have passed most readers of the Guardian completely by, because they were very technical, but will have been of immense interest to people who want to do us harm. Q: So it should not have put it out there? NC: As I said, I think it's a totally legitimate debate, about the power of these technologies, about how you get the balance right, how you make sure these technologies are used in a proportionate and accountable way, but I don't think just giving technical secrets, if I can put it that way, to people who want to do us harm, serves any purpose. Theresa May’s view was closer to that of Parker – and that expressed by David Cameron’s spokesman yesterday. She said: I agree with Andrew Parker. I think it is difficult when you have revelations about how security operates, then that does cause a problem – it can give some comfort to terrorists. And he was very clear about the statement that he made, and I think we need to be very clear about the need to ensure that we have the security arrangements in place that enable us to continue to protect the British public.  11.39am BST  Good morning. Edward Snowden 's father landed in Moscow on Thursday morning and said he hoped to visit his son, who has not been seen in public since he was granted asylum in Russia in August. "I am his father, I love my son and ... I certainly hope I will have an opportunity to see my son," said Lon Snowden in brief remarks to Russian television crews at the airport. "I am not sure my son will be returning to the US again," he said. Shaun Walker has the full story here . Updated at 11.49am BST  4.47pm BST  We're going to wrap this blog up for the day. Join us again tomorrow. Thanks for all your comments.  4.30pm BST  The US senator Ron Wyden has set out a passionate case for reforming the NSA in the wake of Edward Snowden's revelations. Speaking at a Cato Institute conference in Washington , Wyden, who is a member of the Senate's select committee on intelligence, said: Meaningful reform has to end the bulk collection of America’s records. A Fisa court order that allows the NSA to collect the records of huge numbers of ordinary Americans with no connection to terrorism ... is exactly the sort of general warrant that our founding fathers sought to prevent when they wrote the fourth amendment. He added: "Even worse the NSA can’t even demonstrate that this bulk collection provides value beyond what their existing authorities give them." Wyden is sponsoring a surveillance reform bill . He said now is the time to put in place a new surveillance regime. Updated at 4.43pm BST  3.05pm BST  Nick Watt has more on Downing Street's approval of Parker's speech, and the Guardian's defence of publishing the Snowden leaks . The No 10 spokesman said: "The prime minister thinks it was an excellent speech and we are, as you would expect, always keeping under review the measures that are needed to contribute to keeping our country safe." Parker did not mention Snowden by name in a speech that strongly defended Britain's intelligence agencies. But his remarks appeared to be aimed at the whistleblower who gave thousands of intelligence files to the Guardian that revealed surveillance programmes carried out by GCHQ and its US counterpart, the National Security Agency ( NSA ). Alan Rusbridger , the editor-in-chief of the Guardian, mounted a strong defence of the newspaper's reporting of files leaked by Snowden, which highlighted formidable technologies "beyond what Orwell could have imagined". Rusbridger told The World at One on Radio 4: "If you read the whole of Andrew Parker's speech it is a perfectly reasonable speech and it is what you would expect him to say. If you are on the security side of the argument you want to keep everything secret, you don't want a debate and you don't want the press or anyone else writing about it. But MI5 cannot be the only voice in this debate." You can read the full report here and listen to the interview with Alan Rusbridger here .  2.11pm BST  Philip Stephens in the FT offers a partial defence of the Guardian's publication of the Snowden leaks in the face of MI5's concerns. He writes: What should concern us is not that a vast amount of data are being scooped up, but whether there are proper controls on the way it is interrogated. The spooks are not interested in building great haystacks of information; they are after the needles. In the search for those needles, however, they should not be permitted random walks through our privacy. The instinct of intelligence agencies is to push the boundaries. The role of politicians and the press is to test them in the search for balance between security and liberty. The boundaries of GCHQ's work is one of the key talking points. In his speech MI5 director general Andrew Parker said: "It causes enormous damage to make public the reach and limits of GCHQ techniques." Stephens said their should be a balance between public oversight of the security services and trust in its activities. The further they reach, the more intelligence agencies will have to provide more information about the what and why of their operations. The rest of us, however, need to recognise that the digital universe is a vast ungoverned space offering dark shelter to the enemies of freedom. Yes, champions of liberty should keep vigilant watch on the power of the state; but sometimes they should also be reassured by it. Updated at 2.17pm BST  1.51pm BST  The editor of the Guardian has vowed to go on “responsibly” publishing leaks from the whistleblower Edward Snowden despite the concerns of MI5. Alan Rusbridger insisted that revelations in the Guardian had helped stimulate public debate about the extent of surveillance by the state, and he would continue to publish them. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s World at One he said: These revelations are not streaming out of the Guardian ... That’s because we are working slowly and responsibly. As we discover further stories that we think merit the debate – the debate that everyone says is necessary – then we will go on publishing. Rusbridger said last night’s speech by MI5 director general Sir Andrew Parker was "perfectly reasonable and what you would expect him to say". He added: “If you are on the security side of the argument you want to keep everything secret, you don’t want a debate and you don’t want the press writing about it. But MI5 cannot be the only voice in this debate.” The Guardian editor insisted the paper's revelations were in the public interest. "What is significantly new about what we have been revealing is the extent to which entire populations are now being potentially put under surveillance," he said. Rusbridger added: There a difference between harvesting and targeting. But is pretty plain they are harvesting a very great deal, and their ambition is to master the internet and scoop the entire lot up and to save it for as long as possible. They says that’s the haystack and they will then look for needles in extremely controlled circumstances. The question is who gets the oversight of that. Chris Huhne [the former cabinet minister] has said these vast new programmes weren’t discussed at the National Security Council [and] weren’t discussed at cabinet. There has to be wider debate. Asked whether newspaper editors should be the arbiters of what is revealed, Rusbridger said only a handful of MPs were willing to speak out on the issue. He said: “If parliament is not going to have this discussion and if the courts can only discuss this in private, then absolutely it falls to the press to stimulate a discussion, which throughout America, throughout Europe, is one that the public is intensely interested in.” Intelligence chiefs have always maintained that disclosing their tactics is a gift to terrorists, Rusbridger pointed out. But he added: There has to be a balance ... These technologies are formidable. They are beyond what Orwell could have imagined. It may that everything in a social democracy is fine at the moment and that oversight is working. But I would be very surprised if the current oversight methods really understood and knew about some of the things that we have been describing as a result of the Snowden revelations. Updated at 2.22pm BST  12.54pm BST  Nicholas Watt has more on David Cameron's approving comments - made through his spokesman - on Sir Andrew Parker's speech. Asked whether Cameron agreed with Parker that the leak of the Snowden files had been a gift to potential terrorists, the spokesman said: "I would happily point you to all parts of the director general's speech. It was an excellent speech." Asked whether the prime minister's endorsement covered Parker's claim that making public GCHQ's techniques provided "the gift they [terrorists] need to evade us", the spokesman said: "Including that."  12.05pm BST  The website Muckrock claims to have an email from the NSA showing that the number of freedom of information requests the agency received increased by 1,054% in a year. From 6 June to 4 September, the website reports that the NSA received 3,382 FOI requests. The same period the previous year it received 293.  11.58am BST  In an analysis piece , Nick Hopkins writes that not everyone in the intelligence community supports Sir Andrew Parker's views, which he summarises as "the public doesn't have a right to know anything that MI5 deems sensitive". Hopkins writes: In recent days, a former head of MI5, Dame Stella Rimington, acknowledged her old agency needed to be more transparent. A former head of America's National Security Agency, General Michael Hayden, said much the same thing. Last week he told an audience in London: "It's clear to me now that in liberal democracies the security services don't get to do what they do without broad public understanding and support. And although the public cannot be briefed on everything, there has to be enough out there so that the majority of the population believe what they are doing is acceptable." Hopkins also points out that there are those who doubt Parker's assertion that publishing information such as that leaked by Edward Snowden handed a "gift" to terrorists. Three weeks ago, Nigel Inkster, former deputy chief of MI6, played down the potential damage. "I sense that those most interested in the activities of the NSA and GCHQ have not been told much they didn't already know or could have inferred," he said. In an opinion piece for the New York Times, the security specialist Bruce Schneier said: "The argument that exposing these documents helps the terrorists doesn't even pass the laugh test; there's nothing here that changes anything any potential terrorist would do or not do." But he points out that neither Parker, nor those who doubt has claim, can prove their point. The same is true, he says, for the claim foreign intelligence agencies may now have access to Snowden's documents. Perhaps the Russians and the Chinese do now have the files. But if they have obtained them, they have managed a feat that has so far eluded the combined efforts of the British and American intelligence communities.  11.55am BST  Glenn Greenwald, the Guardian journalist who has had the most contact with Snowden, has balked at the treatment of Parker's speech by sections of the British press. How unusual: a top UK national security official screams "The Terrorists!!" over & over to justify govt's actions http://t.co/C7UxzuDYAY To a right-wing paper, it's apparently heinous to publish even after the Government orders you not to http://t.co/C7UxzuDYAY  #PressServants Greenwald doesn't buy MI5's anti-terror spin and questions why GCHQ are involved in spying on Brazilian government departments, Petrobras the oil company that funds social programmes in Brazil, and the US peace campaign the Organization of American States. Could the MI5 chief please identify the Al Qaeda elements at the OAS, Petrobras & Ministry of Mines and Energy? http://t.co/C7UxzuDYAY Updated at 11.59am BST  11.24am BST  Downing street has described Parker's speech as "excellent" according to lobby correspondents. Politics Home's Paul Waugh said a spokesman refused to get drawn into a discussion on whether publication of Snowden's leaks was a "gift" to terrorists. Asked if PM agreed with MI5 chief that Guardian/Snowden data was a 'gift' to terrorists, No10: "The PM thinks it was an excellent speech" But Sky's Anushka Asthan said the implication was that Cameron backed the whole speech. The suggestion was David Cameron supported all parts of the speech (ie including saying Snowden leaks were 'gift' to potential terrorists). Update : Politics Home has a little more on the briefing : Asked specifically if he agreed that the Guardian-Snowden stories were a 'gift' to terrorists, the spokesman said: "I would point you to all parts of the Director General's speech, including that". Updated at 11.32am BST  11.11am BST  The Guardian put out a statement last night defending itself against the head of MI5's claims. It says: A huge number of people - from President Obama to the US director of national intelligence, James Clapper - have now conceded that the Snowden revelations have prompted a debate which was both necessary and overdue. The president has even set up a review panel and there have been vigorous discussions in the US Congress and throughout Europe. Such a debate is only worthwhile if it is informed. That is what journalism should do. Updated at 11.13am BST  10.50am BST  In the US, Keith Alexander, the head of the NSA, also made a speech on Tuesday. According to the Daily Dot , Alexander “indicated that far from backing off on surveillance, the NSA ought to do more of it” – starting with action to prevent cyberattacks on the financial sector. Foreign Policy magazine quotes Alexander as saying: That’s where we’re going to end up at some point. You have to have the rules set up so you can defend Wall Street. FP’s Shane Harris reports: Drawing an analogy to how the military detects an incoming missile with radar and other sensors, Alexander imagined the NSA being able to spot "a cyberpacket that's about to destroy Wall Street." In an ideal world, he said, the agency would be getting real-time information from the banks themselves, as well as from the NSA's traditional channels of intelligence, and have the power to take action before a cyberattack caused major damage. Harris comments: The analogy was a stretch. For starters, what's a "cyberpacket"? Presumably Alexander meant a sophisticated computer worm or virus designed to disrupt a computer or destroy the data inside it. (Maybe like the one his agency reportedly helped design to destroy centrifuges in an Iranian nuclear facility.) But the idea that a single, tiny packet could wipe out Wall Street is laughable. That's like saying a paintball can take out a tank. Harris reports that Alexander acknowledged the NSA had lost some public trust since the Snowden revelations, but he called the press’s accounts of these “sensationalised”. Alexander said he is open to some modifications of existing surveillance programs, particularly one that collects all telephone records in the United States and stores them at the NSA for up to five years. Alexander said he would be comfortable storing the data somewhere else or requiring more reports on how the data is used, but that the NSA's surveillance work should not end. "I think the authorities should stay intact," he said. Updated at 10.50am BST  10.26am BST  Freedom of information campaigner, Heather Brooke, questions the uncritical handling of Parker's speech by much of the British press. It amazes me people think the British press are 'feral'. When it comes to taking on real power, they're pussycats. pic.twitter.com/1e3hVhI4aC Seriously @timesnewsdesk you're printing MI5 press releases on the front page now? pic.twitter.com/ZXCrn2yfyX If it wasn't clear enough already how craven the UK press is, here's the MI5 press release in the Telegraph. pic.twitter.com/IUscl63XxL The Guardian's regular press commentator, Roy Greenslade, has a detailed roundup of how the different ways various sections of the media are treating the speech . Updated at 10.27am BST  10.05am BST  This morning on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, civil liberties columnist Henry Porter of the Observer and Charlie Edwards of the Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies (RUSI) debated MI5 chief Sir Andrew Parker’s claims that “it causes enormous damage to make public the reach and limits of GCHQ techniques” and that “such information hands the advantage to terrorists”. Porter said Parker was wrong: Point to anything that the Guardian has published over the last three months that has seriously put our national security at risk. It is the NSA [National Security Agency] which released the documents, that is where the leak took place. What we have shown is how much surveillance we are under. We don't have sufficient oversight. I don't have that confidence because of the behaviour of the intelligence and security committee over the last few months, which has steadily come out in favour of the intelligence services. Porter said that he and the editor of the Guardian, Alan Rusbridger, would probably not disagree with much of Parker's speech - but he said what he disagreed with was the off-the-record, anonymous briefings that surrounded the speech. These can be clearly seen in the press reports mentioned below : "Parker is said to be ... Sources find it incomprehensible ... In Whitehall, the publication of the documents stolen by Edward Snowden is considered ... Whitehall insiders are scornful", and so on. Edwards said the public did not need to know about the Prism and Tempora programmes uncovered by Snowden's leaks to the Guardian – the US and UK programmes that allow the NSA and GCHQ to harvest, store and analyse data about millions of phone calls, emails and search engine queries. Today tracked the discussion on Twitter: "I think intelligence should remain secret because that is the margin we have against terrorists," says Charlie Edwards, RUSI #r4today "We haven't published anything which jeopardised the security of this country," says Henry Porter, The Observer #r4today "What we have done is shown how much surveillance we are under," adds The Observer's Henry Porter #r4today "I would argue that the public does not need to know about Prism or Tempora," says Charlie Edwards, RUSI #r4today Updated at 10.07am BST  10.02am BST  The new head of MI5 Sir Andrew Parker didn't mention Edward Snowden or the Guardian in his defence of Britain's intelligence techniques ( the full text is published here ). But the Daily Mail, the Times and the Daily Telegraph are in no doubt that he was gunning for the paper and its source in MI5's first public defence of GCHQ since the scale of its surveillance programmes were revealed. The Times said: Parker is said to be furious at the Snowden leaks, many of which have been carried by the Guardian, and by the portrayal of the American as a whistleblower. The MI5 chief is dismissive of claims that the revelations act in the public interest, and believes that what he regards as the theft of hundreds of thousands of classified files can only serve the interests of terrorists and hostile governments. His view is that it can never be in the public interest to help terrorists to improve their attack planning. The Telegraph's security editor Tom Whitehead wrote: Sources find it incomprehensible that exposing spy agency techniques for tracking terrorists has been argued to be in the public interest. But it was the Mail that really went to town on the speech. Mi5 chief Andrew Parker didn't mention Snowden or the Guardian in his Rusi speech - a point lost on the Daily Mail pic.twitter.com/xQIAGqmyPY The Mail wrote : In Whitehall, the publication of the documents stolen by Edward Snowden is considered to have done more damage to the security services than any other event in history. Feted as a hero by the Guardian, Snowden said he wanted to start a public debate on the widespread use of eavesdropping techniques by GCHQ and his former employer, the US National Security Agency ... The Telegraph and the Mail's coverage suggests some interesting Whitehall briefing against Snowden and the Guardian. The Mail reported: One Government official said that, in effect, the Guardian had helped to produce a ‘handbook’ for terrorists. The internet is now rich with websites, based on the newspaper’s revelations, that explain the best way to communicate, while avoiding detection. Whitehall insiders are scornful of the idea that the Guardian and Snowden – who is now holed up in Russia, after a whistle-stop visit to the Chinese territory of Hong Kong – needed to start a debate on state surveillance. There is also anger at the depiction of Snowden as a ‘whistle-blower’ by the Guardian. He downloaded files indiscriminately, not knowing what they contained. But what most disturbs security officials is the knowledge that there are thousands more documents still in the possession of the Guardian, which – despite being warned of the grave threat to national security – continues to publish Snowden’s material. This is what Parker actually said : What we know about the terrorists, and the detail of the capabilities we use against them together represent our margin of advantage. That margin gives us the prospect of being able to detect their plots and stop them. But that margin is under attack. Reporting from GCHQ is vital to the safety of this country and its citizens. GCHQ intelligence has played a vital role in stopping many of the terrorist plots that MI5 and the police have tackled in the past decade. We are facing an international threat and GCHQ provides many of the intelligence leads upon which we rely. It makes a vital contribution to most of our high priority investigations. It causes enormous damage to make public the reach and limits of GCHQ techniques. Such information hands the advantage to the terrorists. It is the gift they need to evade us and strike at will. Unfashionable as it might seem, that is why we must keep secrets secret, and why not doing so causes such harm. Updated at 10.04am BST  9.55am BST  Good morning. On Tuesday night the new head of MI5, Sir Andrew Parker, launched a robust defence of the techniques used by Britain's intelligence agencies and warned they would not be able to sustain current levels of counter-terrorism work without the help of surveillance from GCHQ . He also claimed that "it causes enormous damage to make public the reach and limits of GCHQ techniques", in what was presumably a reference to Edward Snowden's leaking of thousands of classified documents to the Guardian. "Such information hands the advantage to the terrorists," Parker claimed. Nick Hopkins has the full story here . He writes: Parker insisted MI5 did not have or want an "all-pervasive, oppressive security apparatus". Speaking at the Royal United Services Institute thinktank in London, he said: "In some quarters there seems to be a vague notion that we monitor everyone and all their communications, browsing at will through people's private lives for anything that looks interesting." It was a notion that he said was "of course, utter nonsense". In the first public defence of GCHQ by a senior intelligence official, Parker said the agency had played a vital role in stopping many of the terrorist plots MI5 and the police had tackled in the past decade. "We are facing an international threat and GCHQ provides many of the intelligence leads upon which we rely. It causes enormous damage to make public the reach and limits of GCHQ techniques. Such information hands the advantage to the terrorists. "It is the gift they need to evade us and strike at will. Unfashionable as it might seem, that is why we must keep secrets secret, and why not doing so causes such harm." Updated at 9.55am BST  1.20pm BST  There's an ongoing court case between Amazon and IBM to decide who develops the cloud computing infrastructure for the CIA, NSA and the rest of the US intelligence community. IBM protested against the $600m contract awarded to Amazon Web Services in early 2013. Both companies were asked to rebid, and in the latest move on Monday , those rebids have been discounted. That puts Amazon, with its original contract, back on course to finalise the deal. And IBM immediately planning to challenge the latest ruling. For AWS, this is about asserting a position at the top of the cloud provider foodchain. For the public, the question might be which company can be trusted the most. “We are disappointed with the ruling from the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, reversing the GAO's recommendation to reopen the competition and correct flaws in the bidding process,” the statement said. “IBM plans to appeal this decision. This court decision seems especially inappropriate in light of the current times, since IBM's bid was superior in many ways, including being substantially more cost-effective. In addition, IBM has for decades supplied the government with proven mission-critical operations. The company remains committed to provide secure, reliable and robust cloud solutions to federal agencies."  11.55am BST  Returning to Australia, the firm Fastmail, incorporated in Melbourne, is claiming to be NSA -proof, stating that it "does not co-operate with blanket surveillance" and does not give information on its users to anyone outside Australia. Alex Hern reports : Responding to growing public debate over online surveillance by the US National Security Agency , a blogpost from Fastmail to its users emphasised the fact that it is incorporated in Melbourne , and so only has to respond to demands made under Australian law, though it conceded that some of Fastmail's servers are in the US. Robert Norris, Fastmail technical lead, said: “Australia does not have any equivalent to the US National Security Letter, so we cannot be forced to do something without being allowed to disclose it. “We are required to disclose information about specific individual accounts to properly authorised Australian law enforcement with the appropriate supporting documentation, which means a warrant signed by an Australian judge,” Norris says. “We do not co-operate with any kind of blanket surveillance, monitoring or ‘fishing expeditions’, and we do not give out user information to anyone outside Australia. We do not have a legal presence in the US, no company incorporated in the US, no staff in the US, and no one in the US with login access to any servers located in the US."  11.10am BST  As if having to send workers home during the government shutdown wasn't enough, the NSA's vast new $1.4bn data storage centre in Utah has been struck by severe electrical surges. Ten meltdowns in 13 months, the WSJ reports, have meant the NSA can't use its new super computers, but have also seen small explosions that have damaged equipment. Exactly how much data the NSA will be able to store there is classified. Engineers on the project believe the capacity is bigger than Google's largest data center. Estimates are in a range difficult to imagine but outside experts believe it will keep exabytes or zettabytes of data. An exabyte is roughly 100,000 times the size of the printed material in the Library of Congress; a zettabyte is 1,000 times larger. But without a reliable electrical system to run computers and keep them cool, the NSA's global surveillance data systems can't function. The NSA chose Bluffdale, Utah, to house the data center largely because of the abundance of cheap electricity. It continuously uses 65 megawatts, which could power a small city of at least 20,000, at a cost of more than $1 million a month, according to project officials and documents. The NSA has other new data centres in the pipeline, including one in Fort Meade that cost $99m and a smaller one in San Antonio. But each of the nine electrical failures has caused as much as $100,000 worth of damage, and taken six months to investigate each time. In the months that followed, the contractors employed more than 30 independent experts that conducted 160 tests over 50,000 man-hours, according to project documents. Updated at 11.50am BST  10.44am BST  An FOI has revealed that the Australian government knew about the NSA's Prism program two months before the Guardian published its first story, though the public remained in the dark. The Greens senator Scott Ludlam and the South Australian senator Nick Xenophon pursued Labor frontbenchers before the election about what the Australian government knew about Prism. Xenophon was particularly concerned to learn whether Australian parliamentarians were being watched by intelligence agencies. But there were no clear answers. Ludlam asked questions on notice in the Senate about Prism and Australia 's knowledge of the controversial program, which were released again as part of the ABC's FoI request. Senator Joe Ludwig responded to the questions on behalf of the attorney general, Mark Dreyfus. Ludwig told Ludlam that all communications interception activities in Australia undertaken by agencies were carried out in accordance with Australian law, and the government did not comment on the law enforcement or intelligence capabilities of other governments. Ludlam said on Tuesday: "The Australian government has tried to be completely opaque about this. And what we find are attorneys general, either of the Labor or the Liberal variety, will just wave their hands and say 'national security', and that's meant to make you stop asking questions." Updated at 11.51am BST  12.17pm BST  Over the weekend, the Guardian reported that the National Security Agency had made repeated attempts to develop attacks against people using Tor, a popular tool designed to protect online anonymity, despite the fact the software was primarily funded and promoted by the US government itself. Top-secret NSA documents, disclosed by whistleblower Edward Snowden, reveal that the agency's current successes against Tor rely on identifying users and then attacking vulnerable software on their computers. One technique developed by the agency targeted the Firefox web browser used with Tor, giving the agency full control over targets' computers, including access to files, all keystrokes and all online activity. But the documents suggest that the fundamental security of the Tor service remains intact. One top-secret presentation, titled 'Tor Stinks', states: "We will never be able to de-anonymize all Tor users all the time." It continues: "With manual analysis we can de-anonymize a very small fraction of Tor users," and says the agency has had "no success de-anonymizing a user in response" to a specific request. Read the story in full here .  11.52am BST  In the context of the NSA revelations, China's own more explicit internet surveillance operation seems less sinister. But the scale of the operation is now vast, with a new report from Beijing News, via the BBC , claiming that two million people are now employed to monitor blogs, news sites, and social media including Sina Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter. The report by the Beijing News said that these monitors were not required to delete postings. They are "strictly to gather and analyse public opinions on microblog sites and compile reports for decision-makers", it said. It also added details about how some of these monitors work. Tang Xiaotao has been working as a monitor for less than six months, the report says, without revealing where he works. "He sits in front of a PC every day, and opening up an application, he types in key words which are specified by clients. "He then monitors negative opinions related to the clients, and gathers [them] and compile reports and send them to the clients," it says.  11.17am BST  Good morning. Cabinet ministers and members of the national security council were told nothing about the existence and scale of the vast data-gathering programmes run by British and American intelligence agencies, a former member of the UK government has revealed. Chris Huhne, who was in the cabinet for two years until 2012, said ministers were in "utter ignorance" of the two biggest covert operations, Prism and Tempora. The former Liberal Democrat MP admitted he was shocked and mystified by the surveillance capabilities disclosed by the Guardian from files leaked by the whistleblower Edward Snowden. Here is the Guardian’s news story on Huhne’s comments, and here is the comment piece in which he made the remarks. Huhne writes: The cabinet was told nothing about GCHQ's Tempora or the NSA's Prism, or about their extraordinary capability to vacuum up and store personal emails, voice contact, social networking activity and even internet searches. I was also on the National Security Council , attended by ministers and the heads of the secret and security services, GCHQ and the military. If anyone should have been briefed on Prism and Tempora, it should have been the NSC. I do not know whether the prime minister or the foreign secretary (who has oversight of GCHQ) were briefed, but the NSC was not. He also asks whether the Home Office was trying to "mislead" when it called for an "upgrade" in Britain's capability to recover data showing who is emailing and phoning whom, via the now-stalled communications data bill – because "this seems to be exactly what GCHQ was already doing". Updated at 11.19am BST  4.45pm BST  Schneier says the common thread between today's stories is that by eavesdropping the NSA is actually making us less safe. Transparency, he argues, is the way to identify problems. Among IT security professionals, it has been long understood that the public disclosure of vulnerabilities is the only consistent way to improve security. That's why researchers publish information about vulnerabilities in computer software and operating systems, cryptographic algorithms, and consumer products like implantable medical devices, cars, and CCTV cameras. The NSA's two conflicting missions, to protect US infrastructure as well as conducting surveillance to gather intelligence. During the cold war that meant defending domestic systems while attacking Soviet ones. But with the rise of mass-market computing and the internet, the two missions have become interwoven . It becomes increasingly difficult to attack their systems and defend our systems, because everything is using the same systems: Microsoft Windows, Cisco routers, HTML, TCP/IP, iPhones, Intel chips, and so on. Finding a vulnerability – or creating one – and keeping it secret to attack the bad guys necessarily leaves the good guys more vulnerable. Far better would be for the NSA to take those vulnerabilities back to the vendors to patch. Yes, it would make it harder to eavesdrop on the bad guys, but it would make everyone on the internet safer. If we believe in protecting our critical infrastructure from foreign attack, if we believe in protecting internet users from repressive regimes worldwide, and if we believe in defending businesses and ourselves from cybercrime, then doing otherwise is lunacy.  4.25pm BST  Kai Biermann for the Guardian today examines the state of German security and says Europeans need to scrutinise their domestic security, rather than focusing on the NSA. The German intelligence service – the Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND) – to name an example close to home, does exactly the same thing as the NSA abroad and it does so within a similar legal framework. "The differences between the BND and the NSA are much smaller than is generally accepted by the public," write Stefan Heumann and Ben Scott in their study on the legal foundations of internet surveillance programmes in the US, the UK and Germany. Heumann works at the German thinktank Neue Verantwortung (New Responsibility), Scott was an adviser to the former US secretary of state Hillary Clinton and is now a policy adviser at the Open Technology Institute, part of the New America Foundation thinktank. In their study, the analysts compared the legal foundations, focus and parliamentary oversight of spying programmes in three countries. Their findings: the NSA runs the biggest spying programme and has the advantage that its targets – the internet providers – are mainly based in the US. Yet at its core the NSA's surveillance is no different from that of the British GCHQ and the BND in Germany. The underlying laws have the same structure, write Heumann and Scott, even if "their interpretation can differ".  12.51pm BST  Glenn Greenwald on BBC Newsnight last night: You just had people defending GCHQ on the grounds that this is only about terrorism and paedophiles. And yet much of the reporting we have done proves that is a lie. We reported that GCHQ and NSA are spying on Petrobras the large Brazilian oil company that funds social programmes in Brazil - are there terrorists in Petrobras? Or that they are spying on the org of American states when they are negotiating economic agreements - are there paedophiles at the OAS? So I think that the job of journalists is to prevent people in power from lying to the people over whom they are ruling. Updated at 10.59am BST  2.28pm BST  Everyone's having a blast at the 2013 Cybersecurity Summit . Former NSA and CIA chief Michael Hayden and Mike Rogers, chair of the house intelligence committee openly joked about putting Edward Snowden on a hitlist, as picked up by journalist Brendan Sasso. Track #cybersec2013 on Twitter. I think Rep Mike Rogers and Gen Michael Hayden just joked about putting Snowden on a kill list . @ggreenwald Hayden noted Snowden nominated for human rts award "I'd also thought of nominating Mr Snowden but it was for a different list" . @ggreenwald And Rogers said: "I can help you with that" @BrendanSasso  @ggreenwald We've deemed Snowden to be a "non-essential" human. Updated at 2.30pm BST  12.54pm BST  Here's a new report on Freedom on the net by Freedom House : It says: "This edition's findings indicate that internet freedom worldwide is in decline, with 34 out of 60 countries assessed in the report experiencing a negative trajectory during the coverage period. Broad surveillance, new laws controlling web content, and growing arrests of social-media users drove this overall decline in internet freedom in the past year. Nonetheless, Freedom on the Net 2013 also found that activists are becoming more effective at raising awareness of emerging threats and, in several cases, have helped forestall new repressive measures." Carl Bildt, Swedish foreign minister, tweeted it: Report on worrying threats to internet freedom in some parts of the world. Our work increasingly important. http://t.co/qn4E2Xj9Wo  10.09am BST  The documentation of a secret government order has been unsealed by a federal judge in Virginia, showing that authorities demanded the SSL key of Edwards Snowden's secure email provider Lavabit. The key would have also given access to Lavabit's 400,000 other users, reports Ars Technica . Within a month, Lavabit still had not complied to the court's satisfaction—in fact he handed over pages of the key typed in 4-point font—and Levison was ordered to pay a $5,000 fine for each day he did not comply. On August 8, he shuttered Lavabit entirely, destroying the company’s servers. "There's information that I can't even share with my lawyer, let alone with the American public,” Levison told Democracy Now in August 2013. “So if we're talking about secrecy, you know, it's really been taken to the extreme, and I think it's really being used by the current administration to cover up tactics that they may be ashamed of.” Through Facebook , Lavabit owner Ladar Levison explained his own position. “People using my service trusted me to safeguard their online identities and protect their information. I simply could not betray that trust," he said. " If the Obama administration feels compelled to continue violating the privacy rights of the masses just so they can conduct surveillance on the few then he should at least ask Congress for laws providing that authority instead of using the courts to force businesses into secretly becoming complicit in crimes against the American people .” Updated at 10.59am BST  2.02pm BST  Lawyers for human rights activist Baraa Shiban have begun legal action following his detention last week at Gatwick Airport under Section 7, the UK anti-terror legislation. Shiban is employed in Yemen by human rights charity Reprieve and was travelling to a Chatham House event about Yemen on 25 September. He told the Guardian that during his hour-long detention at the airport he was asked - after an apparent web search by the officer - why he opposes counter terrorism work: He took my Reprieve business card and disappeared. When he returned – I would guess having made use of a computer and a popular search engine – he suggested he had detained me not merely because I was from Yemen, but also because of Reprieve's work investigating and criticising the efficacy of US drone strikes in my country. A telling exchange followed: "So," he asked, "does your organisation have anything to do with terrorism in Yemen?" I replied, "My organisation addresses counter-terrorism abuses inside the country." "Exactly!" He said. "Why doesn't your organisation do something about the terrorism that happens in your country, instead of focusing on the counter-terrorism abuses?" What could I reply? Of course I oppose terrorism. But I also oppose the secret air war in my country – waged by the US, apparently with covert support from the UK and others. The drone war in my homeland has claimed innocent lives and terrorised civilians. It operates wholly outside the law, and serves only to fuel anti-western sentiment. Updated at 11.00am BST  1.19pm BST  Snowden, will you marry me?! It started with a tweet ... ...but former Spy Anna Chapman threw her toys out of the pram when an NBC interviewer asked her if the wedding was still on. The Moscow Times says she stopped the interview dead. I am not going to discuss that. I think, the interview is over, because it went wrong somehow. @nsa will you look after our children? Updated at 11.00am BST  1.14pm BST  A former telecoms executive told the Wall Street Journal that his 2007 conviction of insider trading was the result of a set-up by the NSA. Joseph Nacchio used to head Qwest Communications but served 54 months in prison on charges of selling $52m of stock as the company's valued tanked in the dot com crash. The pre and post prison pictures are startling: even outside court in 2007 Nacchio is a smart, suited, smiling executive with rounded edges - but after release in September 2013 he looks more Edward Norton, bald head, goatee and furrowed brow. Mr. Nacchio said he still believes his insider-trading prosecution was government retaliation for rebuffing requests in 2001 from the National Security Agency to access his customers' phone records. His plans to use that belief as a defense at trial never materialized; some of the evidence he wanted to use was deemed classified and barred from being introduced. To Mr. Nacchio, the revelations of former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, who leaked documents saying the agency monitors the email and phone records of Americans, have justified his own stance. He contended the NSA's request was illegal. "I feel vindicated," he said. "I never broke the law, and I never will." The NSA declined to comment, the story says. For now, he's focusing on shopping two books to publishers. One will be about what he says is Americans' loss of liberty based on his experiences with the NSA and other agencies. Another will be based on his incarceration and is "a little bit like Woody Allen and Mel Brooks go to prison". Updated at 11.03am BST  7.14pm BST  Caspar Bowden, as we heard yesterday, left Microsoft to work in privacy advocacy. Here's a full 48-minute presentation by him on European internet surveillance law . Hat tip to UnsleepingMind . If you have the time, do check out this eye-opening talk by Caspar Bowden. He provides a great introduction to the history of European and international surveillance policy. Note: you will be disturbed by the level of access that western intelligence agencies have had to global communications systems from the 1950s onwards!  7.00pm BST  There was a live Reddit Ask Me Anything (AMA) on Tuesday with NSA reporter Glenn Greenwald and Guardian US editor in chief Janine Gibson. A flavour, with opening comment from cunthslayer : The NSA likely has files on every person in the position of power to stop their surveillance/economic espionage operation. Do you agree with this statement, and if that is the case how do you think America can take steps towards limiting the power and abuses of the NSA? To which glenngreenwald responded : That document did not state definitively that the NSA provided the communications of members of Congress and judges to Israel, though it did reference such communication. Other reports, as we indicated (including from the New York Times in 2009), have previously reported on efforts to wiretap even members of Congress. A major reason why those in power always try to use surveillance is because surveillance = power. The more you know about someone, the more you can control and manipulate them in all sorts of ways. That is one reason a Surveillance State is so menacing to basic political liberties. But there are all sorts of examples, including from recent history, demonstrating that even the most seemingly insurmountable institutions can be weakened or uprooted when they become abusive enough. The tide is clearly turning against the US National Security State in general and the NSA in particular in terms of their ability to dictate terms and control the debate, and they know it. What will ultimately determine the outcome here is how much pressure citizens continue to apply in defense of their privacy rights and against massive, ubiquitous, secret spying systems aimed at them. Updated at 2.08pm BST  6.04pm BST  A Bulgarian-German novelist and privacy activist was on Monday refused entry to the US, writes the Guardian's Berlin correspondent Philip Oltermann . Ilija Trojanow, who had been on his way to a literary conference in Denver, was told at Salvador da Bahia airport, Brazil, that US authorities wouldn't allow him into the country. He was told his case was “special”, but was given no further explanation for his rejection. Trojanow was one of the initiators of an open protest letter against NSA surveillance which was signed by 67,407 members of the public and handed over to the German chancellor last month . As well as the author of several prize-winning novels, he is the co-author with Juli Zeh of a book on the surveillance state, Angriff auf die Freiheit (“An attack on freedom: the security delusion, the surveillance state and the dismantling of our rights”). In an article published this morning on the website of Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung , Trojanow explains that he has repeatedly asked officials for an explanation for the rejection, but was given no answer. His ESTA application for entry to the US had been approved before he embarked on his trip. He writes that his case “illustrates the consequences of a disastrous development and reveals the naivety of those who try and reassure themselves with the mantra 'It doesn't apply to me'”. Writing on her Facebook page , novelist Juli Zeh commented: “This is a farce. Sheer paranoia. People who stand up for human rights are treated as if they are enemies of the state” Updated at 6.07pm BST  5.49pm BST  Yesterday wasn't official 'call to action' day for anything NSA related but there were a swathe of Snowden-related events, comments and hearings incluidng the finalists for the European Union's annual prize for freedom of thought - named after Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov. Snowden is nominated alomgside Malala Yousafzai and three Belarusian political prisoners: Ales Bialatski , Eduard Lobau and Mykola Statkevich. The winner will be announced on 10 October and the award presented (that could be interesting) on 20 November. In Strasbourg. Or not. Our review of Richard Lourie's Sakharov biography explained that he became famous - and troubled - after publishing a 1968 essay called 'Reflections on Progress, Peaceful Coexistence and Intellectual Freedom'. The technologies of samizdat have new resonance under Snowden's era, as digital formats are increasingly compromised... Sakharov's essay was discursive, naive and utterly explosive. Writing with sympathy for the ideals of communism, he denounced the Soviet regime for its denial of basic freedoms, defended intellectual openness and called for the convergence of capitalism and communism under a new world government by the year 2000. The essay circulated in samizdat - typed manuscript that dissidents copied on their own typewriters with fading carbon paper and passed from hand to hand. Soon copies reached the outside world. The New York Times printed the entire essay in July 1968, about a month before Soviet and other Warsaw Pact tanks squelched the Czech Communist Party's attempted liberalization in Prague... Updated at 2.08pm BST  2.09pm BST  It was the select audience at the Henley Literary Festival yesterday that were treated to Dame Stella Rimington, former MI5 head, describing Julian Assange and Edward Snowden as "self-seeking twerps". The nation needs convincing that the security services are working in favour of the nation, avoiding the perception that the services are invading people's privacy. Rimington also called for more oversight of the security services, according to the Times [subscription]. The people who are seeking to harm us are increasingly sophisticated and are using the most sophisticated forms of communication in order to conceal their plans. Our intelligence services have to be given the tools to go there in order to pre-empt the kind of horrible things that they've seen happening in Kenya. It is very important for our intelligence services to have the kind of oversight that people can have confidence in, so that we can be quite sure that in giving them these powers we know that they are being supervised and scrutinised in the way they use them. And I think that may mean that now is the time to look again at the oversight of our intelligence services. Updated at 2.10pm BST  1.43pm BST  Another person banging the drum for more transparency over surveillance is Michael Hayden, a former director of the NSA. As reported by Nick Hopkins , Hayden told an event in London on Monday that US security structures are based on a system established in 1947: It's clear to me now that in liberal democracies the security services don't get to do what they do without broad public understanding and support. And although the public cannot be briefed on everything, there has to be enough out there so that the majority of the population believe what they are doing is acceptable. He added: "My community has to show a lot more leg or we won't get to do any of what we want to do because the public support is so withdrawn that, politically, nobody is going to give us the authorisation. Presidents can do one-offs" without constitutional authority, he said, but "no president can do something repeatedly over a long term without that broad popular support.  11.07am BST  Unsurprisingly, Edward Snowden chose to submit a statement on paper, rather than appear by weblink at yesterday's hearing of the European Parliament Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs . But appear he did - an exile has apparently not compromise his decision to blow the whistle. In a three-minute reading, Jesselyn Radack, National Security & Human Rights Director of the Government Accountability Project read the statement in full, and Snowden kicked off by calling the mass surveillance of whole populations "the greatest human rights challenge of our time". We've transcribed Snowden's speech in full: I thank the European parliament and the LIBE committee for taking up the challenge of mass surveillance. The surveillance of whole populations rather than individuals threatens to be the greatest human rights challenge of our time. A culture of secrecy has denied our societies the opportunity to determine the appropriate balance between the human right of privacy and the governmental interest in investigation. These are not decisions that should be made for a people but only by the peopler after full, informed and fearless debate. Yet public debate is not possible without public knowledge - and in my country the cost of one in my position of returning public knowledge to public hands has been persecution and exile . If we are to enjoy such debates in the future we cannot rely upon individual sacrifice. We must create better channels for people of conscience to inform not only trusted agents of government but independent representatives of the public outside government. When I began my work it was with the sole intention of making possible the debate we see occurring here in this body and in many other bodies around the world. Today we see legislative bodies forming new committees calling for investigations and proposing new solutions for modern problems. We see emboldened courts that are no longer afraid to consider critical questions of national security. We see brave executives remembering that if a public is prevented from knowing how they are being governed the necessary result is that they are no longer self governing. And we see the public reclaiming an equal seat at the table of government. The work of a generation is beginning here with your hearing, and you have the full measure of my gratitude and support. Updated at 11.02am BST  6.21pm BST  The latest Guardian story reveals Marina , the codename for a vast repository of data on millions of web users backdated up to one year. Data includes search terms, emails and account passwords gathered from NSA collection systems, although phone data is stores separately. An introductory guide to digital network intelligence for NSA field agents, included in documents disclosed by former contractor Edward Snowden, describes the agency's metadata repository, codenamed Marina. Any computer metadata picked up by NSA collection systems is routed to the Marina database, the guide explains. Phone metadata is sent to a separate system. "The Marina metadata application tracks a user's browser experience, gathers contact information/content and develops summaries of target," the analysts' guide explains. "This tool offers the ability to export the data in a variety of formats, as well as create various charts to assist in pattern-of-life development." The guide goes on to explain Marina's unique capability: "Of the more distinguishing features, Marina has the ability to look back on the last 365 days' worth of DNI metadata seen by the Sigint collection system, regardless whether or not it was tasked for collection." Updated at 2.10pm BST  5.20pm BST  zacmcd is right on the zeitgeist: "if you want privacy you now have to pay for it." LidBlownOff makes a great point about spam – it would be great to get some figures on that: "Move[d] my email to a non-US server as soon as this NSA obscenity broke into the public domain. Interesting to note the immediate improvement. Before – using google mail and google search – I would regularly get at least 15 spam messages a day. After switching totally away from Google I have not received a single spam message." The bottom line from Ralfph on the challenge for any kind of Euro Cloud, as suggested by Caspar Bowden: "Still need to protect the Euro cloud from GCHQ and BND." Is the Euro Cloud really the answer? analoguy thinks that's more complicated than it looks: "The NSA, GCHQ, etc. have spy centers right here in Europe, like in the Frankfurt area of Germany, which is a major hub for all internet traffic within Europe. So I'm afraid all those good intentions are kind of a waste of time and money." vFuzzy wants answers: "Why isn't there a public outcry by the American people against a government which betrayed them? How can they live with their lives being infiltrated and spied upon by an agency caught in it's own lies? Why aren't the members of government and the NSA involved being sued for privacy issue and data infringement along with international espionage plus the trafficking of data involving matters of national security to another sovereign nation. The Agency breaks international laws and breaks all code of ethics yet still they are able to justify it. This just shows how weak the American people really are standing by while their government takes away their civil rights and all meaning from the amendments." Updated at 1.26pm BST  4.57pm BST  It's unlikely that Mark Zuckerberg ever intended 'the social graph' to be plundered by national security services, but the New York Times reports that the NSA has been exploiting public social data to map social connections, locations and travel plans. The NYT picked up on the analysis of social data partly because it did not distinguish between US and non-US citizens. An agency spokeswoman, asked about the analyses of Americans’ data, said, “All data queries must include a foreign intelligence justification, period.” “All of NSA’s work has a foreign intelligence purpose,” the spokeswoman added. “Our activities are centered on counterterrorism, counterproliferation and cybersecurity.” The legal underpinning of the policy change, she said, was a 1979 Supreme Court ruling that Americans could have no expectation of privacy about what numbers they had called. It took two full days for technology tabloid the Register to respond with the requisite post headlined: " NSA in new SHOCK ' can see public data' SCANDAL ! More spooky but less surprising: the NSA seems to have worked out that if punters are already publishing information about themselves on social networks like Facebook or Twitter, it might be able to scoop that information into its databases (and from there into its analysis) without a warrant. Updated at 1.25pm BST  4.54pm BST  The little known Investigatory Powers Tribunal exists to hear the complaints of British citizens who have been under surveillance by the state, yet it meets in secret hearings where the complainant is represented by an unnamed lawyer appointed by the group. Where, this documentary asks, should the balance lie between openness and effective oversight? Secrecy and Surveillance , from BBC Radio 4's File on Four, is online until Saturday 5 October. Updated at 1.25pm BST  4.09pm BST  Today's Congress on Privacy and Surveillance in Geneva Lausanne has been pulling no punches, with speakers including former Microsoft privacy advisor Caspar Bowden who left the company in 2011. "Approached many of the European authorities with my concerns and they shrugged. Then we had Edward Snowden and ever since then I've been busy. "I didn't know about Prism when I was at Microsoft and I don't trust Microsoft now. I'm completely free software now." Bowden proposes an "EU cloud" and said that users should be warned when they log on to services based in the USA that might put the users within the surveillance range of a foreign government. He also said that he stopped using Microsoft products and exclusively uses free, open source software now. Facebook use reminds me of people who smoke – they know it's not healthy, but they do it anyway. There are rich pickings in our liveblog ... Updated at 6.13pm BST  12.49pm BST  Welcome to our hub for all Edward Snowden, NSA and GCHQ-related developments around the world, as controversy over revelations leaked by the whistleblower continue to make headlines. As arguments rage over how much of our day to day life should be monitored in the name of security, we'll be tracking the growing global debate about privacy in the digital age. We'd like to know what you think about the whole NSA story, what you're worried about – and any new areas you'd like to read more about There's more fallout from the NSA revelations every day. Send us your links/jokes/theories and we'll do our best to both aggregate and unravel... Let's go! Three German email providers – including the part state-owned Deutsche Telekom – have set up a joint venture offering an encrypted email service to German citizens, the Wall Street Journal reports. Germany is famous for its rigid laws on privacy, and Email Made in Germany relies on German servers under the jurisdiction of German law; that should mean no visibility for US security services. The service launched in August and has 100,000 users. There's a new business around "being the Cayman Islands of data privacy", according to one analyst. Some European leaders are renewing calls for a "euro cloud," in which consumer data could be shared within Europe but not outside the region. Brazil is fast-tracking a vote on a once-dormant bill that could require that data about Brazilians be stored on servers in the country. And India plans to ban government employees from using email services from Google and Yahoo Inc. European Commission vice-president Neelie Kroes, who supervises the EU's digital portfolio, has been encouraging the bloc's companies to tout their privacy credentials. "Privacy is not only a fundamental right," she said in Estonia this summer. "It can also be a competitive advantage."
