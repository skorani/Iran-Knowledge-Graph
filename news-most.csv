"Iran's recent JCPOA-related steps no threat to NPT","TEHRAN, May 21 (MNA) – Iran's recently announced measures regarding the level of its commitments to the nuclear deal (JCPOA) are not a slightest threat to the nuclear non-proliferation regime, Russian representative to the IAEA said Tuesday. "It [Iran] has already said that it could review the project of modernization of the heavy [water] reactor in Arak and raise the level of uranium enrichment, as a next step. We would not like to see further escalation from any side. I can only say that if Iran makes these steps, not a slightest threat to the nuclear proliferation will be in place, because the most important thing is that Iran does not refuse to implement its commitments under the Additional Protocol about guarantees of the International Atomic Energy Agency .... If it [Iranian nuclear program] is peaceful, than there will be no threat to the nuclear non-proliferation regime or to the international security. So we do not overdramatize [the situation around the JCPOA]," Russia's Permanent Representative to International Organizations in Vienna Mikhail Ulyanov told Sputnik on Tuesday. He stressed that the Additional Protocol was a "powerful and efficient" mechanism for checking whether Iran was implementing its nuclear program exclusively peacefully, UrduPoint quoted Sputnik as saying. "Tehran ... just signals that it is strongly dissatisfied with the current situation, explains why it is dissatisfied and urges the other signatories to make steps to revise the situation. I believe there is no reason to condemn it," Ulyanov added. He further told Sputnik that Russia considers it necessary to hold a meeting of the Joint Commission of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) at the level of political directors, but the date of the meeting has not been set yet, since European signatories are not ready. "I believe our European colleagues are trying to comprehend and process the situation, so the idea to hold a meeting is currently pending," Ulyanov added. Tehran announced its decision to suspend some of its obligations under the JCPOA on May 8, one year after the US abrupt withdrawal from the agreement. On the same day, Iran  gave nuclear deal signatories -- France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Russia, China and the European Union--  an ultimatum, saying it would step up uranium enrichment in 60 days if they did not shield Tehran from sanctions imposed by the United States after Washington quit the pact last year. Tehran said that these measures, which are within the framework of the nuclear deal, were taken in response to Washington violating the JCPOA. MNA/SPUTNIK © 2017 Mehr News Agency.

President Trump has warned about Iran’s determination to pursue nuclear capacity, and it appears he was right on the mark. According to the Iranian state-run IRNA news agency, Behrouz Kamalvandi, the spokesman of the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran, announced that Iran has quadrupled its uranium-enrichment production capacity, saying, “We will soon be crossing the 300-kg limit in several weeks.” Helima Croft, global head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, told CNBC , “We are woefully underappreciating the seriousness of this crisis.” Richard Nephew, a senior research scholar at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy, said, “The comparison here is they were already going 55 miles per hour and heading towards a busted bridge. And so what the AEOI is saying is that they threw a brick on the accelerator. They would have eventually breached the threshold. What they’re saying today is they are deliberately and intentionally trying to breach the threshold faster.” IFP News reported, “Iran made a nuclear announcement recently in reaction to the United States withdrawal from the nuclear deal on 8 May, 2018. The statement of the Supreme National Security Council of Iran said that the country would reduce nuclear commitments under the framework of 2015 nuclear deal, by evading 300-kg limit on the amount of low-enriched uranium, and also 130-tonne limit for storage of heavy water produced at its Arak facility.” Kamalvandi added, “Iran can resume 20 percent enrichment within four days. Whether to conduct the 20-percent enrichment in Natanz or in Fordow is a question that needs to be considered by the Committee to Monitor and Supervise Implementation of the JCPOA at the Iranian Supreme National Security Council.” CNBC noted, “Though uranium must be enriched to 90% to make weapons, much of the work to reach that tipping point has already been done once uranium is enriched within a range of 3% to 4%.” The Daily Mail reports that Kamalvandi said Iran enriched its uranium because the Trump administration had eliminated waivers allowing Iran to trade enriched uranium to Russia in return for unprocessed yellowcake uranium, and also derailed Iran selling heavy water to Oman. As the Daily Mail notes, “Heavy water helps cool reactors producing plutonium that can be used in nuclear weapons. At the rate that Iran is enriching its uranium, the country will soon violate the stockpile limitations set by the Iran nuclear deal, which Europe still clings to but President Trump exited. With tensions simmering between Iran and the U.S., British Defense Secretary Penny Mordaunt indicated that if a conflict breaks out, the U.K. will stand with the U.S. She noted that the U.K. was “already deployed in the region, “ adding, “This is a region where we have a huge stake and a huge amount invested and we are working with our allies and partners to firstly try to de-escalate things in the region but also to truly understand the facts behind recent events.” Mordaunt also said, “The United Kingdom shares the United States’, European and Gulf partners’ concerns about Iran’s destabilizing activities. We continue to work closely with our allies and partners to mitigate the threats to regional security.”","https://www.dailywire.com/news/47504/iran-quadruples-its-uranium-enrichment-capacity-hank-berrien"
"Is John Bolton the most dangerous man in the world?","The US is closer to war with Iran than it has been since the Bush years, or perhaps ever. And Bolton is largely to blame  Thu 16 May 2019 02.00 EDT   Last modified on Fri 17 May 2019 14.43 EDT   Donald Trump’s national security adviser John Bolton wants the United States to go to war with Iran . We know this because he has been saying it for nearly  two  decades . And everything that the Trump administration has done over its Iran policy, particularly since Bolton became Trump’s top foreign policy adviser in April of 2018, must be viewed through this lens, including the alarming US military posturing in the Middle East of the past two weeks. Just after one month on the job, Bolton gave Trump the final push he needed to withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement, which at the time was (and still is, for now) successfully boxing in Iran’s nuclear program and blocking all pathways for Iran to build a bomb. The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) – as the Iran deal is formally known – was the biggest obstacle to Bolton’s drive for a regime change war, because it eliminated a helpful pretext that served so useful to sell the war in Iraq 17 years ago. Since walking away from the deal, the Trump administration has claimed that with a “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran, it can achieve a “better deal” that magically turns Iran into a Jeffersonian democracy bowing to every and any American wish. But this has always been a fantastically bad-faith argument meant to obscure the actual goal (regime change) and provide cover for the incremental steps – the crushing sanctions, bellicose rhetoric, and antagonizing military maneuvers – that have now put the United States closer to war with Iran than it has been since at least the latter half of the Bush administration, or perhaps ever. And Bolton has no qualms about manipulating or outright ignoring intelligence to advance his agenda, which is exactly what’s happening right now. In his White House statement 10 days ago announcing (an already pre-planned) carrier and bomber deployment to the Middle East, Bolton cited “a number of troubling and escalatory indications and warnings” from Iran to justify the bolstered US military presence. But multiple sources who have seen the same intelligence have since said that Bolton and the Trump administration blew it “out of proportion, characterizing the threat as more significant than it actually was”. Even a British general operating in the region pushed back this week, saying he has seen no evidence of an increased Iranian threat. What’s even more worrying is that Bolton knows what he’s doing. He’s “a seasoned bureaucratic infighter who has the skills to press forcefully for his views” – and he has a long history of using those skills to undermine American diplomacy and work toward killing arms control agreements. As a senior official in the George W Bush administration, he played key role in the collapse of the Agreed Framework, the Clinton-era deal that froze North Korea’s plutonium nuclear program (the North Koreans tested their first bomb four years later). He said he “felt like a kid on Christmas day” after he orchestrated the US withdrawal from the international criminal court in 2002. And now as a senior official in the Trump administration, he pushed for the US to withdrawal from a crucial nuclear arms treaty with Russia. While it’s unclear how much of a role he played in scuttling Trump’s negotiations with Kim Jong-un in Hanoi last year, he publicly called for the so-called “Libya model” with the North Koreans (in other words, regime change by force). Just months before joining the administration, he tried to make the legal case for a preventive war against Pyongyang. And if you think he cares about the aftermath of war with North Korea, he doesn’t. Bolton was reportedly “unmoved” by a presentation during his time in the Bush administration of the catastrophic consequences of such a war. “I don’t do war. I do policy,” he said then. So far, Bolton has been successful in moving the United States toward his desired outcome with Iran – if getting the Pentagon to draw up plans to send 120,000 US troops to the region to confront Iran is any indication. There are hopeful signs that we can avoid war, as US officials and our European allies, seemingly alarmed by what Bolton is up to, are sounding the alarm about the Trump administration skewing intelligence on Iran. But Bolton is on a fast track, seemingly aware that Trump’s time in office may be limited. The question, ultimately, is whether the president can stick to his instincts of avoiding more military conflict, or acquiesce to a man hellbent on boxing him into a corner with no way out other than war with Iran.

"“Allies Are Aghast”: Is John Bolton Replaying His Iraq War Playbook with Iran?","With the Trump administration slipping onto war footing with Iran, there are growing fears inside Washington that John Bolton, the president’s hawkish national-security adviser, is plagiarizing his own Iraq war playbook. “Everyone feels the shadow of 2002–2003: The administration seems determined to find a cause for conflict; allies are aghast; the public seems disengaged,” a former senior U.S. official told me, shortly after The New York Times  reported that administration officials had begun drawing up plans to send as many as 120,000 troops to the Middle East. “It’s hard for anyone to fathom why [ Donald Trump ] would think a war of choice is a good idea, given what he’s said in the past about Iraq and Afghanistan.” And yet, having outsourced his Iran policy to the architects of America’s forever wars, Trump may be stumbling toward another. Earlier this month, Bolton announced the deployment of a carrier strike group to the region, in order to send a “clear and unmistakable message” that the U.S. was “fully prepared” to retaliate against some unspecified Iranian threat. An administration official now claims the military has detected “a number of preparations for possible attack” on American troops—British authorities are skeptical —and are blaming Tehran for the recent sabotage of four oil tankers in the Persian Gulf. On Wednesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo  ordered all “non-emergency U.S. government employees” to leave Iraq, raising fears that some kind of military action is imminent. It’s unclear whether Trump has been fully briefed on the Bolton-led plan—or, indeed, if any concrete plan exists. Asked on Monday whether he was planning on sending 120,000 troops to the region, the president called the reported proposal “fake news” before apparently endorsing it. “Would I do that? Absolutely. But we have not planned for that,” Trump said. “And if we did that, we’d send a hell of a lot more troops than that.” Experts worry that Bolton, who has long advocated for regime change in Iran, is trying to engineer a confrontation that would draw his more dovish boss into a military conflict. “To name names, there is a concern that if John Bolton got his way, would he lead the United States into war?” said Cornelius Adebahr, a nonresident fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “The perception is that John Bolton hasn’t changed. He is the same John Bolton that advocated bombing Iran as little as three years ago.” (“The president has been clear, the United States does not seek military conflict with Iran, and he is open to talks with Iranian leadership,” Garrett Marquis, a National Security Council spokesman, told the Times. “However, Iran’s default option for 40 years has been violence, and we are ready to defend U.S. personnel and interests in the region.”) Bolton, of course, has a history of abusing U.S. intelligence to justify his foreign-policy goals. Perhaps most notorious was a May 2002 speech at the Heritage Foundation, in which Bolton, then the State Department’s undersecretary for arms-control issues, accused Cuba of developing biological weapons—an assertion American officials at the time said overstated U.S. intelligence, and which Bolton subsequently tried to repeat to Congress. Later, as the Bush administration made the case for invading Iraq, Bolton helped sell the lie that Saddam Hussein was building nuclear weapons. “We saw a pattern of Mr. Bolton trying to manipulate intelligence to justify his views,” former deputy secretary of state Tony Blinken recently told  The New Yorker when discussing Bolton’s failure to secure Senate confirmation when he was appointed as U.S. ambassador to the U.N. “If it had happened once, maybe. But it came up multiple times, and always it was the same underlying issue: he would stake out a position, and then, if the intelligence didn’t support it, he would try to exaggerate the intelligence and marginalize the officials who had produced it.” Suzanne DiMaggio, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment, agreed that Bolton is a “repeat offender of intelligence manipulation.” But she fears that the Trump administration’s latest moves—bolstering its military presence in the Middle East, escalating rhetoric—will become a self-fulfilling prophecy, goading Iran into responding in kind, and giving Bolton and other hard-liners the justification they need to launch another war. “No matter what you think is happening, the one thing that we know for sure is that tensions and hostilities are coming to a boiling point,” she said. “And for me, my greatest worry is a military conflict that occurs due to a miscalculation.” In the event of a miscalculation, DiMaggio fears, “Trump doesn’t have the judgment or the skill needed to manage a conflict before it spirals out of control.” With the Iran nuclear deal, President Barack Obama helped institutionalize a set of incentives for Iran to behave—and for future U.S. administrations to negotiate with Iran’s government in good faith. By withdrawing from that multi-national framework, Trump put the United States at odds with its European allies—which were proponents of keeping the nuclear deal intact—and on a collision course with Iran that was arguably bound to end in conflict. For Bolton, it may all be by design. “Bolton has figured out how to get his way—in Venezuela, now in Iran, simply moving ahead on what certainly looks like a revival of neocon policy,” the former senior U.S. official told me. “And for whatever reason, Trump is on board or perhaps doesn’t care. Or doesn’t notice.” Follow to get the latest news and analysis about the players in your inbox. Condé Nast © 2019 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

"Allies hunker down in Iraq, drop out over US tensions with Iran","U.S. allies involved in operations in the Middle East appear uninterested in the increasingly bellicose rhetoric from the White House and Pentagon regarding Iran. Germany and the Netherlands suspended military training operations in Iraq due to increasing regional tensions, a Spanish frigate was recalled from its voyage with a U.S. Navy carrier strike group and a British general was sharply rebuked by U.S. Central Command after telling reporters that Iranian-backed militias in Iraq and Syria did not pose an increased risk to U.S. and coalition allies fighting the Islamic State. National Security Adviser John Bolton, and other administration leaders, have repeatedly warned that intelligence shows there is an increased threat that Iran or its proxy groups could attack the U.S. or its allies, though they have withheld the details of that intelligence. European allies voiced concern this week that the tensions could accidentally trigger a conflict after the Pentagon dispatched a Patriot missile defense battery, a bomber task force, an amphibious transport dock and a carrier strike group to the region. “We are living in a crucial, delicate moment where the most relevant attitude to take — the most responsible attitude to take — should be that of maximum restraint and avoiding any escalation on the military side," Federica Mogherini, the European Union’s diplomatic chief, said Monday . The military posturing is paired with President Donald Trump’s economic sanctions to pressure Iran to renegotiate the nuclear deal that the U.S. abandoned a year ago, according to Lawrence J. Korb, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress and former assistant secretary of defense. “For Bolton, on the other hand, I think he wants to send the forces into the region and he hopes the Iranians will respond and then he can go to Trump and say ‘well, you got to do a one-off attack like we did in Syria,’" Korb told Military Times. He added that European allies want to continue the previous nuclear deal for fear of starting a nuclear arms race between Saudi Arabia and Iran. “A lot of people say it looks like the prelude to our invasion of Iraq, but I think it’s much more like the Gulf of Tonkin in 1964 when you put all those troops in there," Korb said. "Then you get misperceptions. Then you get people overreacting.” Sign up for the Early Bird Brief - a daily roundup of military and defense news stories from around the globe. The Gulf of Tonkin incident is often seen as a cautionary tale for U.S. war planners. During a confrontation off the shores of Vietnam, now discredited reports of enemy vessels coming into contact with U.S. warships offered the catalyst for U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. The parallels between that incident and the current situation near Iran were highlighted by a series of questionable claims of “sabotage” to oil tankers near the Persian Gulf over the weekend. In addition to sending additional military assets to the region, the U.S. State Department ordered the departure of all non-emergency U.S. government employees from Iraq at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad and the U.S. Consulate in Erbil over the security threats. A spokesman for the German Defense Ministry said Wednesday that Germany is suspending military training operations in Iraq due to increasing regional tensions. Germany has roughly 60 soldiers near Baghdad to train Iraqi security forces, as well as about 100 troops in the Kurdish regions of northern Iraq, according to Deutsche Welle . Spain also recalled the frigate Mendez Nunez that was accompanying the U.S. aircraft carrier strike group “The U.S. government has taken a decision outside of the framework of what had been agreed with the Spanish Navy,” acting defense minister Margarita Robles said, according to Reuters . Netherland’s state broadcaster NOS reported on Wednesday that the country also suspended its military training mission because of the security threat. The 50-troop mission primarily trains Kurdish forces. Despite the allied response, a top British Army officer in Iraq said the threat level from Iranian-backed militias in Iraq had not risen in recent weeks. “Am I concerned about the danger: no, not really," Army Maj. Gen. Christopher Ghika, a deputy commander with the anti-ISIS coalition, said Tuesday of Iranian threats. Ghika said that force protection measures have been reviewed in “light of the events in the last week,” and were “completely satisfactorily.” CENTCOM pushed back against Ghika Tuesday afternoon. “Recent comments from OIR’s Deputy Commander run counter to the identified credible threats available to intelligence from U.S. and allies regarding Iranian backed forces in the region,” said Capt. Bill Urban, CENTCOM’s lead spokesman. “OIR is now at a high level of alert as we continue to closely monitor credible and possibly imminent threats to U.S. forces in Iraq.” Despite the sharp rebuke from the U.S. military, British defense officials issued a statement Wednesday morning backing up Ghika’s comments that there has always been a threat from Iranian proxies in the region, as well as from other actors, but that threat has not increased in recent weeks in Iraq and Syria. U.S. officials have so far declined to comment on the record regarding what threats they have identified coming from Iran. MOD statement following Major General Chris Ghika's Pentagon press briefing. Full briefing can be watched here: https://t.co/U64v2E9BvU  pic.twitter.com/4tZrD9zN1D The New York Times reported Tuesday that a U.S. “intelligence report” had collected data in April through “intercepts, imagery and other information" that indicated “Iran was building up its proxy forces’ readiness to fight and was preparing them to attack American forces in the region.” The Times did not say which U.S. intelligence agency compiled the report, nor did it identify the officials who provided the information. The failures of pre-war intelligence leading up to the Iraq War — which did not properly vet sources and was selectively curated to mislead Congress — was the subject of a U.S. Senate investigation in the years following the 2003 Iraq invasion. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates said over the weekend that some oil tankers affiliated with their countries were hit by “sabotage attacks” in the Persian Gulf. Though, no link has been drawn that could connect those attacks to Iranian forces. The increased tensions come at the same time as Washington is ratcheting up pressure on the Iranian regime over the nuclear deal that the U.S. abandoned one year ago. European signatories to the deal — Germany, the United Kingdom and France — have criticized the U.S. government’s approach and urged Iran to remain in compliance with the deal despite U.S. economic sanctions and the military build-up in the region.

"Iran Still Doesn’t Want an Escalation","Argument:  Iran Still Doesn’t Want an Escalation  Iran Still Doesn’t Want an Escalation...  By threatening to back away from the nuclear deal last week, Iran seemed to reverse its yearlong policy of strategic patience. So far, however, the country’s actions and announcements indicate that it will stay the course. But patience can easily run out. On May 8, Tehran announced its decision to partially reduce its compliance with the terms of the 2015 nuclear deal (known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA). The move was a response—Iran’s first—to increasing U.S. pressure after the Trump administration decided to leave the agreement last year. Until now, Iran had remained fully compliant with its obligations, as quarterly reports issued by the International Atomic Energy Agency confirm. It has also mainly refrained from escalating tensions in the region through its proxies or retaliating against U.S. provocations, such as Washington’s recent designation of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization . Tehran’s strategic patience was driven by the assumption that, although the status quo was less than ideal, the waiting game would serve Iran better than escalation. The country believed it could ride out the rest of U.S. President Donald Trump’s term in the hope that a new administration would reinstate the JCPOA or adopt a less aggressive posture. Holding back and staying in the agreement would also allow Iran to keep the moral high ground and international support. But Iran’s calculations changed when, in late April, the United States revoked key sanctions waivers that had enabled Iran to continue selling some of its oil to China, India, Japan, South Korea, and Turkey despite the U.S. embargo. The loss of export revenue would further damage an already broken economy. And making things worse, on May 3, the United States also decided to tighten restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program, no longer allowing Tehran to store excess heavy water produced in Oman or swap enriched uranium for raw yellowcake with Russia . With that, it became infinitely less appealing for Iran to stay in the deal. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, who has invested tremendous political capital in the nuclear file since 2013, was left with nothing other than the moral high ground. Senior Iranian officials started to argue that Iran should not only withdraw from the JCPOA but also from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, of which Iran has been a signatory since 1968. It is thus not surprising that Iran was finally pushed into action—or at least the appearance of it. After all, Iran has refrained from actually leaving the deal’s legal framework. Through a statement issued by the Supreme National Security Council (a key institution that brings together Iran’s main national security decision-makers), the country stressed that its steps are fully in line with Sections 26 and 36 of the JCPOA , based on which Iran is entitled to consider the U.S. withdrawal and reintroduction of nuclear-related sanctions as grounds to cease performing its commitments in whole or in part. Meanwhile, the specific ways in which the country is going to roll back its cooperation—stockpiling surplus heavy water and low enriched uranium above the agreed limits without shipping them abroad—are very limited and entirely reversible. Based on preliminary assessments, Iran might even remain within the thresholds of the deal in the short run, further reducing the imminent nuclear threat posed. Finally, although Tehran threatened to resume higher uranium enrichment and halt the Chinese-led effort to redesign its Arak heavy water nuclear reactor, it gave a 60-day window for finding a solution with the remaining signatories to the JCPOA. More specifically, Rouhani clarified that his ultimatum will be enforced only if the remaining signatories don’t make good on their promises to shield the country’s oil and banking sectors from U.S. sanctions. By all appearances, then, Iran is still not interested in unraveling the JCPOA. It just wants to make clear that the status quo, in which the country endures maximum pressure without any tangible benefit in return, is no longer sustainable. Until the 60-day deadline, Iran is likely to test whether the waiting game is still worth playing and continue refraining from escalation. Tensions in the region might still increase over the next few weeks, as demonstrated by Iran’s apparent “ sabotage attack ” of four commercial vessels off the coast of the United Arab Emirates, just outside the Strait of Hormuz. However, similar to what happened over the past year, escalation is unlikely to be a strategy proactively sought by Iran but rather the product of accidents or miscalculations. Much of what happens after the July 7 deadline will depend on whether Tehran believes that incremental gains are still possible. And those depend on the ability of the remaining signatories to the JCPOA to offer concrete benefits, not just political ones, to Iran in exchange for continued constraint. It will not be easy, but Europe will need to make quick progress operationalizing INSTEX, the payment mechanism that France, Germany, and the United Kingdom developed to facilitate legitimate trade with Iran without incurring into U.S. sanctions. It will also have to find ways for Iran to sell its oil. Following Iran’s announcement, European capitals renewed their commitments to the preservation of the JCPOA and to get INSTEX up and running soon. It is less clear whether they’ll put any effort into addressing the oil sales issue. It is harder to imagine a change of heart on the U.S. side, but at least some sections of the Iranian leadership are not without hope. Officials such as Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif have signaled their willingness to work with Trump. On April 24, just days after the oil waivers were revoked, Zarif offered to negotiate a prisoner exchange with the United States and stressed that the U.S. president, unlike others in his administration, seems keen to talk to Tehran. Trump himself recently opened up to the possibility of direct talks with Tehran to make “a fair deal.” Although he is unlikely to turn U.S. Iran policy on its head in less than two months, any signal that he’s willing to be constructive might induce Iran to stick with strategic patience a while longer. Over the next few weeks, Iran will decide whether its existing strategy still serves its purpose or, instead, escalation in the region better matches its national security interests. With so much at stake, all the parties involved need to carefully assess the costs and potential consequences the latter path would have for Iran, the region, and, ultimately, the world.

"Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs","Israeli Security, Regional Diplomacy, and International Law In Tehran, regime officials are worried that the pressure applied by the U.S. administration is meant to expedite regime change, not just curb Iran’s nuclear and hegemonic ambitions in the region. The battle over the future of Iran has intensified in recent days. The U.S. has amplified its economic sanctions against the Islamist regime, namely waiving the remaining exemptions for certain countries that were purchasing Iranian oil; declaring the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps a terrorist organization; prohibiting heavy metals imports from Iran; and disallowing Iran from exporting excess low-grade enriched uranium and heavy water, which it was permitted to do within the framework of the nuclear deal. Incidentally, the license was granted so that Iran could produce these materials without stockpiling them in larger quantities than stipulated by the nuclear deal. The U.S. has also begun moving forces to the Persian Gulf and closer to Iran. Tehran announced that if Europe fails to act to temper the economic fallout from American sanctions, it will gradually withdraw from the nuclear deal. Its leaders, meanwhile, are threatening to target the U.S. and its allies. In response, the Europeans have stressed that despite their commitment to the nuclear deal, if Iran stops fulfilling its obligations they will have to renew sanctions. Russia and China are standing with Iran, as expected, while inside Iran tensions continue to foment over the country’s economic distress. Western nuclear experts are still publishing analyses of Iran’s nuclear archives. These reports highlight the progress Iran’s military nuclear program has made until 2003, and illustrate the degree to which the International Atomic Energy Agency was irresponsible in regard to the nuclear deal. (The agency itself continues to remain silent in the face of these reports.) The Iranian regime’s ultimate objective is to ensure its own survival, and saving the nuclear deal gives it the ability to manufacture unhindered a large nuclear arsenal within 11 years. In Tehran, officials are worried that the pressure applied by the U.S. administration is meant to expedite regime change, not just curb Iran’s nuclear and hegemonic ambitions in the region. Iranian leaders are presently at odds over the best way to contend with the American pressure. They could introduce austerity measures and also wage “economic jihad” (in the words of the Iranians) by attempting to extort from Europe, through threats, compensation for the financial losses they are expected to incur as a result of the sanctions. They are also seeking to deter the U.S. by threatening them and their allies with the use of military force, under the assumption that President Donald Trump and segments of his administration don’t want an escalation. It’s still unclear whether Iran’s most recent declarations reflect a concrete decision in this regard; it’s possible these threats toward the West are merely a trial balloon, and that the Iranians believe they can avoid having to back them up. These threats put the regime on a course that will only exacerbate its anguish: Europe will be compelled to move toward shedding the nuclear deal and there will be a greater probability of an escalation. In all likelihood, the Iranians would rather wait until the next U.S. presidential election before making their decision, in the hope that Trump is replaced by a Democratic candidate who will restore the nuclear deal. However, it appears Ayatollah Ali Khamenei believes an immediate response to the sanctions is needed to maintain the regime’s reputation as all-powerful in the eyes of Iranians; and that the country’s dire economic situation can threaten the regime’s stability. Still, it’s more reasonable to assume that Tehran, at this stage, will seek to avoid a direct military clash with the United States by recognizing the limits of its own might and vulnerability in the face of American military capabilities. It seems these insights are at the core of current U.S. policy. The Americans want to knock the Iranians off balance and force them to make a move before the next U.S. election. The Iranian regime’s dilemma: Adhere to the nuclear deal or trash it outright and jeopardize its survival, or succumb to the pressure and agree to renegotiate the deal. At this stage, the regime is rejecting the possibility of surrender, although their failure to boost the economy, together with festering popular unrest, could ultimately induce it to choose this course. Israel needs to support the U.S. in its efforts to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. It must be prepared for the possibility that an escalation in the Persian Gulf will lead to a clash with Iran’s regional proxies, chief among them Hezbollah, Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hamas.

"The Latest: Pakistan urges US, Iran to exercise restraint","DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — The Latest on developments in the Persian Gulf region and elsewhere in the Mideast amid heightened tensions between the U.S. and Iran (all times local): 10:45 p.m. Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry has urged the United States and Iran to exercise restraint and resolve their all issues through talks to avoid conflict. Mohammad Faisal, ministry spokesman, told a news conference Thursday that recent developments in the Persian Gulf region were disturbing and that Washington’s move to “deploy aircraft carrier and bombers has added to the tensions and the existing precarious security situation in Middle East.” He said Islamabad expects all sides to show restraint “as a miscalculated move can transmute into a large-scale conflict.” Pakistan has been a key ally of the United States in its war on terror since 2001 and it also enjoys good relations with neighboring Iran. Pakistan also has close ties with Saudi Arabia and it maintains a balancing act between Riyadh and Tehran. ___ 4:55 p.m. Sky News is reporting that the U.K. has raised the threat level for British personnel in Iraq because of a heightened risk from Iran. Sky also said on Thursday that British forces and diplomats in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Qatar have also been placed on an increased state of alert. The Ministry of Defense declined to comment. But it said Wednesday that it recognizes threats in the region to British, American and coalition forces and acts accordingly. The ministry says it keeps “the security of our deployed personnel and assets under constant review” and that it has a “very robust range of force protection measures.” It says that Britain “has long been clear about our concerns over Iran’s destabilizing behavior in the region.” ___ 4:35 p.m. A state-aligned Saudi newspaper is calling for “surgical” U.S. strikes in retaliation against alleged threats from Iran. The Arab News published an editorial in English on Thursday, arguing that after incidents this week against Saudi energy targets, the next logical step “should be surgical strikes.” The editorial says U.S. airstrikes in Syria, when the government there was suspected of using chemical weapons against civilians, “set a precedent.” It added that it’s “clear that (U.S.) sanctions are not sending the right message” and that “they must be hit hard,” in reference to Iran, without elaborating on what specific targets should be struck. The newspaper’s publisher is the Saudi Research and Marketing Group, a company that had long been chaired by various sons of King Salman until 2014 and is regarded as reflecting official position. ___ 3:30 p.m. Iran’s ambassador to the United Nations says the Islamic Republic is not interested in escalating regional tensions but has the “right to defend ourselves.” Majid Takht-e Ravanchi made the comments in an interview Thursday on NPR’s “Morning Edition.” Ravanchi said: “We are not interested in the escalation of tensions in our region. If something goes wrong, everyone loses.” However, he added: “It is our right to be prepared. It is our right to defend ourselves.” He accused the U.S. and regional nations of airing “false allegations” about Iran. In recent days, the United Arab Emirates has alleged four oil tankers off its east coast were targeted in sabotage attacks, while Iranian-allied rebels in Yemen launched a coordinated drone attack on Saudi Arabia. The U.S. has sent an aircraft carrier and bombers into the Mideast to counter a still-unexplained threat it perceives from Tehran. ___ 2:30 p.m. Iran says it has successfully tested a firewall to prevent cyberattacks on industrial facilities. Telecommunications Minister Mohammad Javad Azari Jahromi said in a post on his Instagram page that the firewall was designed by Iranian students, without providing further details. Iran blamed Israel for a cyberattack on its communications infrastructure in November. The Islamic Republic moved to boost its cyber capabilities in 2011 after the Stuxnet computer virus destroyed thousands of centrifuges involved in its contested nuclear program. Stuxnet is widely believed to be an American and Israeli creation. ___ 1:15 p.m. Yemen’s Health Ministry has raised the death toll from early morning airstrikes by the Saudi-led coalition, saying six people were killed, including four children. The ministry says 41 people were also wounded, including two women of Russian nationality. Thursday’s airstrikes came after Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels, who control the capital, launched a drone attack Tuesday on a critical oil pipeline in Saudi Arabia, Tehran’s biggest rival in the region. Meanwhile, Saudi Deputy Defense Minister Khalid bin Salman wrote on Twitter on Thursday that Tehran had ordered “the terrorist acts” carried out by the Houthis against the oil pipeline. He said the attack proves the Houthis “are merely a tool that Iran’s regime uses to implement its expansionist agenda in the region.” ___ 11:50 a.m. A Yemeni medic and residents of the country’s capital, Sanaa, say at least three people, including a child, were killed in Saudi-led airstrikes on the city earlier in the morning. Thursday’s airstrikes came two days after Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels, who control the capital, launched a drone attack on a critical oil pipeline in Saudi Arabia, Tehran’s biggest rival in the region. In Sanaa, people scrambled to pull 14 wounded from the rubble of a building hit by one of the airstrikes in the al-Raqas neighborhood. A medic at the al-Manar city hospital said bodies of three civilians killed in the strikes were brought to the hospital morgue. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn’t authorized to speak to the media. Fawaz Ahmed, a middle-aged broker, told The Associated Press he saw the three bodies being retrieved from the rubble — a father, his child and his wife, all buried together. —Ahmed Al-Haj in Sanaa, Yemen; ___ 10:30 a.m. Residents in the Yemeni capital of Sanaa are saying there has been a wave of airstrikes that have hit targets in the city this morning, including a residential house. They say there are casualties, including civilians. The residents say the airstrikes started early on Thursday, with coalition jets bombing military sites belonging to the rebel Houthis who have been at war with the coalition since 2015. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media. On Wednesday, Iran-aligned Houthi rebels launched a coordinated drone attack on a critical oil pipeline in Saudi Arabia, Tehran’s biggest rival in the region. It was the latest incident to shake global energy markets. —Ahmed Al-Haj in Sanaa, Yemen; ___ 9:40 a.m. The Qatar-funded satellite news broadcaster Al-Jazeera says that Doha is trying to “defuse escalating tensions” across the Persian Gulf. Al-Jazeera cited an anonymous official on Wednesday night as saying that Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani had traveled to Tehran in recent days to speak with his Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif. Al-Jazeera said the U.S. was aware of the trip in advance, but did not elaborate further. FlightRadar24.com, a flight-tracking website, showed a Qatari government airplane landed in Tehran on Saturday. Qatar hosts the forward headquarters of the U.S. military’s Central Command at its vast Al-Udeid Air Base. Several of the B-52 bombers ordered by the White House to the region amid the latest escalation between Washington and Tehran are stationed there. Qatar has grown closer to Iran diplomatically amid it begin boycotted by four Arab nations over a political dispute. ___ 9:30 a.m. Iran’s foreign minister says his country is committed to an international nuclear deal but that the escalating U.S. sanctions are “unacceptable.” The remarks come amid rising tensions in the Mideast, with allegations of sabotage targeting oil tankers near the Persian Gulf, a drone attack by Yemen’s Iranian-allied rebels and the dispatch of U.S. warships and bombers to the region. Foreign Minister Mohammad Zarif told Japanese officials on Thursday in Tokyo that his country’s response to the U.S. actions is within the frameworks of the current nuclear deal and Iran’s rights. Iran recently threatened to resume higher enrichment in 60 days if no new nuclear deal is in place, beyond the level permitted by the current one between Tehran and world powers. The U.S. pulled out of the deal last year. Copyright 2019 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

"Saudis blame Iran for drone attack amid calls for US strikes","DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Saudi Arabia accused Tehran of being behind a drone strike that shut down a key oil pipeline in the kingdom, and a newspaper close to the palace called for Washington to launch “surgical” strikes on Iran, raising the specter of escalating tensions as the U.S. boosts its military presence in the Persian Gulf. Concerns about possible conflict have flared after the U.S. dispatched warships and bombers to the region to counter an alleged but unspecified threat from Iran. There also have been allegations that four oil tankers were sabotaged Sunday off the coast of the United Arab Emirates, and Iran-aligned rebels in Yemen claimed responsibility for Tuesday’s attack on the Saudi pipeline. Fears have grown out of President Donald Trump’s decision last year to withdraw the U.S. from the 2015 nuclear accord between Iran and world powers and impose wide-reaching sanctions — the latest levied as recently as last week — that have crippled Iran’s economy. But Trump took a soft tone Thursday, a day after tweeting that he expected Iran to look for talks. Asked if the U.S. might be on a path to war with the Iranians, the president answered, “I hope not.” Saudi Prince Khalid bin Salman, who is King Salman’s son and the country’s deputy defense minister, tweeted that the drone attack on two Saudi Aramco pumping stations running along the East-West pipeline were “ordered by the regime in Tehran, and carried out by the Houthis” — a reference to the Yemeni rebel group. A state-aligned Saudi newspaper went further, running an editorial calling for “surgical” U.S. strikes on Iran in retaliation. Iran has been accused by the U.S. and the U.N. of supplying ballistic missile technology and arms to the Houthis, which Tehran denies. The front-page editorial in the Arab News, published in English, said it’s “clear that (U.S.) sanctions are not sending the right message” and that “they must be hit hard,” without elaborating on specific targets. It said the Trump administration had already set a precedent with airstrikes in Syria, when the government there was suspected of using chemical weapons. Ali Shihabi, who runs the Saudi-leaning Arabia Foundation in Washington, said there’s a sense that if the Iranians can get away with targeting Saudi oil infrastructure, then “the whole security infrastructure in the Gulf will be called into question and security premiums on oil will rise.” He said it would seem that Riyadh would like to coordinate with Washington how it responds to Iran, but “eventually what may happen is that just Saudi Arabia and the UAE may have to do something.” “Nobody is going to start a war with them (Iran), but I think they should be defanged and, you know, things like their naval capabilities, things like their missile capabilities should be downgraded at least to make their capacity to inflict such dangerous activity more painful, more costly,” Shihabi said. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who also is defense minister and controls major levers of power in the Sunni kingdom, has not commented publicly on this week’s incidents. In a Saudi TV interview in 2017, he said the kingdom knows it is a main target of Shiite Iran and there is no room for dialogue with Tehran. A top Emirati diplomat said late Wednesday the Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthis in Yemen would “retaliate hard” for attacks on civilian targets, without elaborating. However, Anwar Gargash also said the UAE is “very committed to de-escalation” after the alleged sabotage of the tankers off the country’s coast. He declined to blame Iran directly, although he repeatedly criticized Tehran. In response to the oil pipeline attack, the coalition said it launched airstrikes on Houthi targets in the rebel-held capital, Sanaa, killing at least six people, including four children. At least 40 other people were wounded, according to Yemen’s Health Ministry. Residents of Sanaa scrambled to pull wounded people from the rubble of a building hit by the airstrikes. Fawaz Ahmed told The Associated Press he saw three bodies — a man, a woman and a child, all buried together. The coalition, which includes the UAE, has been at war with the Houthis since 2015, carrying out near-daily airstrikes. The pipeline attack marked one of the rebels’ deepest and most significant drone strikes inside Saudi territory since the conflict began. Washington already has warned shipping companies that “Iran or its proxies” could be targeting maritime traffic in the Persian Gulf region and said it deployed an aircraft carrier strike group and B-52 bombers there to counter the threat. Last week, U.S. officials said they had detected signs of Iranian preparations for potential attacks on U.S. forces and interests in the Middle East but did not provide any evidence to back up the claims. The U.S. State Department has ordered all nonessential government staff to leave its embassy and consulate in Iraq. Germany and the Netherlands both suspended their military assistance programs in the country in the latest sign of tensions. Iraq is home to powerful pro-Iranian militias, while also hosting more than 5,000 U.S. troops. The U.S. military’s Central Command said its troops were on high alert, without elaborating. European nations have urged the U.S. and Iran to show restraint. Also, a senior British officer in the U.S.-backed coalition fighting the Islamic State group, Maj. Gen. Chris Ghika, said earlier this week that there had been no increased threat from Iranian-backed forces in Iraq and Syria. His comments exposed international skepticism over the U.S. military buildup. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said during a visit to Tokyo that Iran has the right to respond to the “unacceptable” U.S. sanctions, but has exercised “maximum restraint.” Speaking about Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers, Zarif was quoted as also saying: “A multilateral deal cannot be treated unilaterally.” Iran recently said it would resume enriching uranium at higher levels if a new nuclear deal is not reached by July 7. That would potentially bring it closer to being able to develop a nuclear weapon, something Iran insists it has never sought. ___ Associated Press writers Ahmed Al-Haj in Sanaa, Yemen, Jon Gambrell in Dubai and Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo contributed.","https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/nation/irans-foreign-minister-says-us-sanctions-unacceptable/"
"Trump Readies a New War on Iran’s Economy","The warships and the leaked battle plans are getting the attention. But the real attack on Iran may be sanctions designed to destabilize the country and undermine its leadership. The Trump administration’s increasingly aggressive military posture toward Iran is overshadowing its more concrete plans for crippling the regime in Tehran: a set of robust new sanctions to add to its economic warfare campaign. Senior professionals inside the administration, who have been crafting Iran policy since before President Trump’s inauguration, are considering another sanctions package designed to destabilize Iran, undermine that country’s leadership, and, potentially, serve as an alternative to military action. Among the proposals being looked at are sanctions that would effectively blacklist certain sectors of the Iranian economy, including the petrochemical sector, according to two individuals with direct knowledge of the conversations. An aggressive sanctions strategy isn’t a new tactic for the president. Since Trump took office, the administration has slapped sanctions on nearly 1,000 individuals and entities to tighten the screws on Tehran. But the latest round of proposed sanctions would make it even more difficult, if not legally impossible, for many other countries or companies to do business in some of Iran’s most significant business sectors. A Treasury spokesperson told The Daily Beast on Wednesday that the department doesn’t comment on future sanctions actions. The new sanctions approach comes at a time of increasingly tense U.S.-Iran relations. Over the past week, the Trump administration has rushed B-52 bombers and warships to the Middle East, discussed a plan , as reported by The New York Times , to send up to 120,000 troops to the region, and ordered the partial evacuation of the embassy in Baghdad. Those moves have come in response to what National Security Adviser John Bolton and others have portrayed as a new, mysterious Iranian threat, with officials leaking claims of Iran attacking Saudi oil tankers and the State Department saying last week that there was “heightened Iranian readiness” to conduct operations against the U.S. The statements have increased the likelihood of a direct, or even inadvertent, confrontation. And lawmakers, fearful of such an outcome, have called for more briefings from the administration on Capitol Hill. While the White House has shied away from saying publicly that it supports regime change in Iran, experts and allies of the Trump administration who spoke to The Daily Beast say an extreme sanctions regime, if executed correctly, could effectively provide that outcome if economic conditions were poor enough. “Like the Reagan administration viewed the Soviet Union, this administration views the regime in Iran as one day destined for the ash heap of history,” said Mark Dubowitz, chief executive of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington, D.C., think tank that has been vocal in its opposition to the Tehran government. “But regime change is not the official policy of the U.S. government, though it appears more and more to be the aspiration of the Iranian people.” Dubowitz said he and his team have met with the administration over the last week about the rising tensions between the U.S. and Iran. Team Trump’s aggressive sanctions strategy was first developed during the 2016 presidential campaign, during which Trump advisers were sharply critical of the Obama administration’s landmark nuclear deal and eager to punish Iran for what it viewed as destabilizing regional activity. During the presidential transition, Saudi Arabia sent an official to New York to meet with Trump officials about regime change in Iran. As The Daily Beast previously reported , General Ahmed al-Assiri spoke to then Trump national security aide Michael Flynn and others about an approach to regime change that included economic, information, and military tactics for weakening the Tehran government. Months later, George Nader, a Lebanese-American emissary to the UAE and Saudi Arabia, pitched American officials on a plan to carry out economic sabotage against Iran, as The New York Times  reported . Throughout this process, the Foundation for Defense of Democracies has played an advisory role. The organization’s senior counselor John Hannah worked on the State Department’s transition team, and other members have worked with the administration on Iran policy. Trump ultimately pursued a highly aggressive sanctions regime while staying within the nuclear deal framework. But in the spring of 2018, he announced that the U.S. would back out of the pact even as international experts had concluded that Iran was abiding by the terms of the agreement. As Trump has ratcheted up sanctions on Iran, he has also brought into his administration some of the foremost anti-Iran hawks in Republican politics, chief among them Bolton. The moves have sparked fears of more direct military confrontation—fears that have been amplified during the past week. But Trump himself remains privately averse to military action, fearful that it would have potentially damaging consequences on the U.S. economy. In several instances over the past two years, when senior administration officials have briefed Trump on Iran and the situation in the region, the president has expressed concerns about the potential impact that rising tensions could have on oil markets, according to two people familiar with his private comments. In raising this to senior officials, Trump has suggested that a major clash between Iran and the U.S. could create a ripple effect that erases domestic economic gains that the American public has enjoyed in recent years—gains for which Trump has taken credit and that he hopes to run on in the 2020 election. The president and his top advisers have continued to keep military action as an option, with the president issuing vague threats to the Islamic Republic over Twitter. But Trump has also continued to publicly flirt with the possibility or brokering a new nuclear agreement with Tehran. “I hope to be able at some point, maybe it won’t happen, possibly won’t, to sit down and work out a fair deal,” he insisted while speaking at a rally in Florida early this month. “We’re not looking to hurt anybody,” Trump said, even as his administration continued weighing and reviewing plans for troop deployments and devastating sanctions.

"The White House builds a path to war with Iran","Analysis  Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events  At a meeting with journalists in New York last month, Iran’s top diplomat offered a mnemonic for what he saw afflicting his nation . Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif decried the “four Bs," a group of men who, in Zarif’s view, were perfidiously steering the United States toward war with Iran. These were Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed b in Salman, United Arab Emirates crown prince and de facto ruler Mohamed b in Zayed, Israeli Prime Minister B enjamin Netanyahu and White House national security adviser John B olton. The first two, Sunni Arab royals, see Iran as a regional nemesis; the latter two have made no secret of their hostility to diplomacy with Tehran and their desire, instead, for regime change there . Zarif stressed that he believed that these four men were at odds with President Trump, a leader averse to military entanglements in the Middle East and somebody who, left to his own devices, would happily cut a new deal with the Islamic republic rather than try to squeeze it into submission. But if the Iranian foreign minister genuinely thought Trump would tack a different direction a few weeks ago, he may think otherwise now. On Monday, the New York Times reported that acting defense secretary Patrick Shanahan last week presented an updated military plan that included the possible deployment of 120,000 U.S. troops in the Middle East, which could theoretically form the logistical springboard for a ground invasion of Iran . Shanahan did so on the apparent request of Bolton, who not long before issued a video of himself announcing the arrival of a U.S. carrier group in the region in response to supposed new threats from Iran and its militant proxies in Iraq, Yemen and elsewhere. “The high-level review of the Pentagon’s plans was presented during a meeting about broader Iran policy,” noted the Times . “It was held days after what the Trump administration described, without evidence, as new intelligence indicating that Iran was mobilizing proxy groups in Iraq and Syria to attack American forces.” The following day, Trump scoffed at the report but didn’t deny that he would entertain such a commitment. “It’s fake news, okay?” he told reporters . “Now, would I do that? Absolutely. But we have not planned for that. Hopefully we’re not going to have to plan for that. And if we did that, we’d send a hell of a lot more troops" than the 120,000 figure floated by the Times. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle complained that the White House had not fully briefed Congress on the current state of play, my colleagues reported . On Wednesday, the United States ordered all “non-emergency” personnel stationed in Iraq to leave the country, ratcheting up tensions in the region even further. “Iran is and has been for decades a malevolent actor and a state sponsor of terror,” Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) told Post columnist Greg Sargent . “But I’m also gravely concerned about actions taken by the administration that appear calculated to put us on a collision course.” Senator @TomCottonAR tells Firing Line if it comes to war with Iran, he is confident the United States would win, and would win swiftly. “Two strikes, the first strike and the last strike,” says the Senator. pic.twitter.com/twTdrFTwHu As my colleague Adam Taylor wrote , American military planners are well aware of the colossal risks of conflict with Iran . But that doesn’t mean American political leadership will steer the country away from its current confrontational trajectory. As with Venezuela and North Korea, Trump appears to have let Bolton take the lead on Iran, with potentially dangerous consequences . The Trump administration’s “maximum pressure” campaign on the Iranian regime seeks to choke off Iran’s oil exports and coerce the regime to change its policies in the region. (Experts warn that sanctions are only galvanizing nationalist sentiment among Iranians .) In response, after a year of reckoning with the United States’ reimposed sanctions, the Iranian government resumed a number of its nuclear activities previously curtailed by the nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers — an agreement that Trump, spurred by Bolton, opted to reject . Tensions spiked after alleged attacks over the weekend on four oil tankers off the coast of the United Arab Emirates, which an anonymous U.S. official linked to Iran . On Tuesday, Saudi authorities said that armed drones flown by Iranian-backed Yemeni rebels hit two pumping stations on a major Saudi oil pipeline. Iranian officials denied culpability for the tanker attacks and claimed that they were being wrongly framed for sabotage . The Trump administration has long pointed to the “destabilizing” behavior of Iran and its militant allies in the region; analysts now fear that the guardrails that once kept a perilous escalation at bay have fallen to the wayside . “The sense of foreboding is tangible, the threats from both sides are no longer rhetorical,” wrote the New Yorker’s Robin Wright . “Before the nuclear-deal negotiations began, in 2013, Washington was consumed with hyped talk of the United States or its allies bombing Iran. If the nuclear deal formally dies, talk of military confrontation may again fill both capitals—even if neither country wants it.” In an interview with CNN , Majid Takht-Ravanchi, Iran’s ambassador to the United Nations, suggested that the talk of new U.S. troop deployments to the Middle East was “psychological warfare” and then echoed Zarif’s talking point. “Nobody is going to have benefit from such a conflict in our region, except for a few, some people in Washington and some countries in our neighborhood,” Ravanchi said. For now, the Trump administration insists that it doesn’t want a fight . “We fundamentally do not seek war with Iran,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on the sidelines of meetings with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Tuesday. “We have also made clear to the Iranians that if American interests are attacked we will most certainly respond in the appropriate fashion.” If we go to war with Iran, we will destabilize the entire region and thousands of Americans and Iranians will die. I am working right now with my Republican colleagues to stop this disastrous rush to war. pic.twitter.com/qJP5i2bNo3 But the White House’s moves have clearly irked allies in Europe and elsewhere, if not the “four Bs” identified by Zarif. On Monday, Pompeo unsuccessfully crashed a gathering of European foreign ministers , hoping to gin up a united front on Iran. He came away with little to show for it . Federica Mogherini, the European Union’s foreign policy chief, cautioned that rather than “maximum pressure” on Iran, "the most responsible attitude to take should be that of maximum restraint and avoiding any escalation on the military side.” On Tuesday, Spanish authorities announced that they were withdrawing a frigate from a U.S.-led naval group in the Persian Gulf because Madrid wanted no part in an explicitly anti-Iran mission. “The U.S. government has taken a decision outside of the framework of what had been agreed with the Spanish navy,” acting defense minister Margarita Robles told reporters in Brussels . On the same day, a leading British military officer in the anti-Islamic State coalition said there was “no increased threat from Iranian-backed forces in Iraq and Syria,” according to the Guardian, seemingly contradicting the recent messaging from American civilian and military officials. For some analysts, the lessons of the 2003 invasion of Iraq — which saw Bolton and other U.S. officials twist intelligence to justify war — have gone unheeded. “I really cannot believe that we failed to learn anything from the first decade of this century,” Elise Jordan, a former official in the George W. Bush White House, said during an appearance on MSNBC. “And we are actually considering escalating with Iran in a war that would further destabilize the region and unleash God knows what in terms of chaos in a very troubled region already.”","https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/05/15/white-house-builds-path-war-with-iran/"

"Fear the Mustache: Why Bolton Makes Even Donald Trump Nervous","The normal aggressiveness of the U.S. military force does not satisfy Bolton; he wants the United States to deepen its aggressiveness. White House National Security Advisor John Bolton talks to reporters outside of the White House West Wing April 30, 2019 in Washington, DC. Bolton answered questions about the security and political turmoil in Venezuela and called for a peaceful transition to a government controlled by acting President Juan Guaido. (Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) Even U.S. President Donald Trump, who is getting ready to pardon war criminals, fears John Bolton. Trump had hesitated to give Bolton a seat in his Cabinet (initially because of Trump’s distaste for Bolton’s bushy mustache). Bolton and General H.R. McMaster were both in line to become National Security Adviser (NSA). Trump went with H.R. McMaster, who lasted a year. Bolton, called “The Mustache” by Trump, slipped into this consequential post. The NSA is the main adviser to the U.S. president on foreign policy—often more important than the Secretary of State. Bolton has Trump’s ear. Trump, mercurial in his policy-making, therefore, has the world’s most dangerous man whispering at him. As his trigger finger tightened with Iran in the gunsights, Trump said of Bolton, “if it was up to John, we’d be in four wars now.” Bolton is on record saying that he would like to turn the immense force of the U.S. military against Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Venezuela. These are likely the “four wars” that Trump mentioned. These would be additional wars, for the United States remains actively at war in Afghanistan as well as in Iraq and Syria. The United States currently operates over 100 military bases—many of them in active operations—around the world. The normal aggressiveness of the U.S. military force does not satisfy Bolton; he wants the United States to deepen its aggressiveness. Bolton is much like the typical war hawk. Such people want to send others to war. They don’t want to go to war themselves. Bolton smartly went into the National Guard in 1970. In a Yale reunion book, he wrote, “I confess I had no desire to die in a Southeast Asian rice paddy. I considered the war in Vietnam already lost.” When Bolton made this personal decision, his heroes—Nixon and Kissinger—began their illegal and barbaric bombing of Cambodia and Laos. Between Bolton’s decision not to go to Vietnam and the U.S. retreat from Saigon, 3,304 U.S. soldiers died as well as uncounted numbers of Vietnamese, Cambodian and Laotian people. In government for most of his life, Bolton worked hard against the good side of history. A key part of Bolton’s work was to help the cover-up of the Reagan administration’s role in supporting the Contras and in the Iran-Contra affair. After the left-wing Sandinistas came to power in Nicaragua in 1979, first the Carter and then the Reagan administration assisted the military and the oligarchy to form la contrarrevolución (the Counter-Revolution) or the Contras. Trained by the United States, the Contras used the most brutal methods against ordinary people to undermine the Sandinista government. When the U.S. Congress—pushed by public opinion—stopped overt U.S. funding for the Contras, the Reagan administration illegally sold arms to Iran, whose profits went to fund the Contras. This was the Iran-Contra scandal. Bolton fought to block Senator John Kerry’s attempts to investigate drug-smuggling and gun-running by the Contras in Nicaragua. He refused to allow documents on the Iran-Contra affair to be turned over to Congressman Peter Rodino. Bolton did the heavy work for the administration, which nonetheless found his language to be often “contentious and intemperate”—as White House spokesperson Marlin Fitzwater said in 1987. Intemperateness is the mood of Bolton. In 1994, he said of the UN Secretariat building in New York that if it “lost ten stories, it wouldn’t make a bit of difference.” Chilling words. Bolton lived them. He spent years trying to undermine any decent arms control treaty in the United Nations framework and he spent years trying to shield the United States from any international accountability. In 2000, Bolton ridiculed the “Church of Arms Control”—the phrase a clear indication of his attitude to peace, one shared with large sections of the U.S. ruling class. It was Bolton who pushed the George W. Bush administration in 2001 to walk away from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972, an act that sent belligerent signals to Moscow. It was Bolton again who egged Bush in 2003 on to smash the Agreed Framework of 1994 between the United States and North Korea. When U.S. intelligence—whose credibility was damaged by the Iraq materials—said that North Korea had begun to enrich uranium, there was to be no further dialogue. Bolton later wrote, “This was the hammer I had been looking for to shatter the Agreed Framework.” It was Bolton once more who urged Trump to depart from the Iran nuclear deal, and most chillingly it was Bolton who killed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty of 1988. Bolton’s record is clear. But so are his words, not only his speeches, but also his deeply informative book—Surrender Is Not An Option (2008). The contours of Bolton’s vision are clear in both the acts and in the words. The fulcrum of his thinking is this: that U.S. power must be unchecked, and it must be used to ensure the perpetuity of U.S. domination. There will be no surrender to any multi-polarity or to bi-polarity (China and the United States). U.S. domination is absolute and should be permanent. Few U.S. elected officials have the guts to disagree with this disagreeable worldview. They salute the flag and send the bombers to spread the stars and stripes across the globe. What are the hindrances for this permanent and absolute U.S. dominion? The United Nations, and any international treaty or body, should not be allowed to interfere with U.S. actions. The UN must be “reformed,” says the U.S. regime, which means that the UN should be brought to the heel of the White House. The European Union, which pretends to be superior to the United States, must not be allowed its “endless process of diplomatic mastication,” wrote Bolton in his book. It must be silenced. The substantial adversaries of the United States—Russia and China—must be cut down, their vulnerabilities used against them. Sanctions are an effective tool here, since to go to war with them would be, even for Bolton, suicidal. Overthrow of the main allies of Russia and China—places such as Venezuela and Iran—would further weaken these aspirant states. Regime change against countries such as Venezuela and Iran, as well as Cuba and North Korea, would not only weaken Russia and China but it would also send a strong message that no one should ever defy the United States. Bolton has a coherent worldview. His hawkish peers—both Republicans and Democrats—don’t have his nerve. They’ll back this regime change war (Venezuela) or that (Iran). They will do so pretending that they are being pragmatic and are responding to “intelligence.” But none of these wars of aggression—whether against Iraq or Iran, Afghanistan or Venezuela—are merely driven by pragmatism. Bolton lays out the full agenda. He is more a mainstream U.S. intellectual than the mainstream would like to admit. The U.S. mainstream is Bolton with manner. Their normalcy is merely Bolton’s philosophy in bits and pieces.  Vijay Prashad is the Director of Tricontinental: Institute for Social Research and Chief Editor of LeftWord Books .

"","Last Sunday the USA dispatched an aircraft carrier strike group and a bomber task force to the Middle East to put pressure on Iran. On Friday, US B-52 bombers landed in Qatar. The agreement on the Iran nuclear deal framework was reached in 2015 between Iran and the P5+1 comprising the USA, the UK, Russia, France, and China plus Germany. Iran was required to redesign, convert, and reduce its nuclear facilities and accept the Additional Protocol. As Iran fully abided by the agreement, all nuclear-related economic sanctions were lifted, freeing up tens of billions of dollars in oil revenue and frozen assets. Major European companies rushed to Iran to benefit from a lucrative market and for energy imports. There were hopes also that the Pak-Iran gas pipeline would now be revived. US President Trump made a U-turn by rejecting the Iran nuclear deal, and launched crippling sanctions against Iran that pushed the Iranian economy to the brink. Iran’s oil exports consequently dwindled from 2.5 million to less than 1.3 million barrels a day and are about to drop even further. The Iranian people, who are already suffering from the raging inflation, currently at 40 percent, would bear the brunt of Washington’s push to bring Iranian oil exports to zero. The Trump Administration is making unjustified and humiliating demands that require total Iranian surrender, not only to the USA, but also to Israel and President Trump’s Gulf allies. A blockade of Iran could lead to retaliation, causing oil shortages and raising oil prices sky-high. Any attack on Iran will be seen in Pakistan as an attempt to destroy yet another stable Muslim country after Iraq, Syria and Libya. Pakistan is still paying heavily for the consequences of the US aggression in Afghanistan. It has lost thousands of civilians and soldiers in attacks by the offshoots of the jihadi network that had been let loose in Afghanistan by the CIA and its allies. One expects Prime Minister Imran Khan to send a clear and unambiguous message to the USA to desist from any military action against Iran as it would have serious consequences for the region, particularly Pakistan which is yet to fully overcome its internal security problems.

"Iran's U.N. envoy denies threat against U.S. forces, calling it 'fake intelligence'","WASHINGTON — Iran's ambassador to the United Nations on Thursday denied that Tehran had given a green light to its proxies to attack U.S. forces in the Middle East, accusing U.S. officials of employing "fake intelligence." In an exclusive interview with NBC News, Ambassador Majid Takht Ravanchi rejected statements from the Trump administration that Tehran posed a heightened danger to U.S. interests in the region. "These are all allegations which are being produced by the same people who, in the run-up to the U.S. invasion of Iraq, did the same," Ravanchi said, in an apparent reference to national security adviser John Bolton, who worked in George W. Bush's administration during the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. "So we do not accept such an allegation. And all of these (allegations) are fake intelligence," Ravanchi said. NBC News reported earlier Thursday that President Donald Trump's decision to deploy an aircraft carrier strike group and bombers to the Persian Gulf was based in part on intelligence that the Iranian regime had informed some of its proxy forces that they can now go after American military personnel and assets in the region , according to three U.S. officials familiar with the intelligence. The intelligence showed that an Iranian official discussed activating Iranian-backed groups to target Americans, the officials said. Trump said on Thursday that his administration had information Iran was "threatening" the United States, though he provided no details. "We have information that you don't want to know about," Trump said. But he added that "we don't want to have to do anything." Trump said he was ready to speak with Iranian leaders and come to an understanding that would allow the country to improve its economic prospects. "What I'd like to see with Iran, I'd like to see them call me. " Trump added: "I look forward to the day where we can actually help Iran. We're not looking to hurt Iran. Asked about Trump's request for talks, Ravanchi said Trump had derailed diplomacy by pulling the United States out of the nuclear agreement last year. The accord had been negotiated between Iran and six governments, including the United States. "The first question that he has to answer is why he left the negotiating table, because we were talking to all participants of the nuclear deal, including the United States, within the framework of the joint commission of that deal. So all of a sudden he decided to leave the negotiating table," Ravanchi said. "What is the guarantee that he will not renege again on the future talks between Iran and the United States?" the Iranian U.N. envoy said. As ambassador to the United Nations, Ravanchi is the highest-ranking Iranian official in the United States, because the two countries have no diplomatic relations. He spoke to NBC News a day after Iran announced it would stop complying with elements of the 2015 nuclear deal in response to U.S. actions. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said Wednesday if his country did not get relief from tough sanctions within 60 days, then Tehran would resume enriching uranium to a higher level than allowed under the 2015 deal. At the White House, Trump said Thursday his administration was ready for a dialogue with Iran as long as it promised not to pursue nuclear weapons. But Ravanchi said Iran was not looking to build a nuclear arsenal. The Iranian diplomat, who took part in the negotiations for the 2015 deal, cited more than a dozen reports from the International Atomic Energy Agency finding Tehran was abiding by the accord. "We are not interested in nuclear weapons," he said. The Trump administration issued yet more warnings to Iran later on Thursday. In a statement, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Tehran had engaged in an “escalating series of threatening actions and statements” and added: “The regime in Tehran should understand that any attacks by them or their proxies of any identity against U.S. interests or citizens will be answered with a swift and decisive U.S. response.” Democratic lawmakers have criticized the Trump administration for pulling out of the nuclear deal and accused Trump's national security adviser John Bolton of stoking tensions and opening the door to a possible war. Trump said Thursday he valued Bolton's advice, while acknowledging the national security adviser offered a more hardline view. Bolton "has strong views on things but that's OK. I actually temper John on things, which is amazing," Trump said. "I have John Bolton and I have other people who are a little more dovish and ultimately I make the decision." Trump also accused former Secretary of State John Kerry, who negotiated the Iran nuclear accord under the previous administration, of telling Iran not to hold talks with the United States. "You know John Kerry, he speaks to them a lot. John Kerry tells them not to call," Trump said. He also accused Kerry of violating the law by allegedly providing advice to Iran. Kerry rejected Trump's allegations through a spokesman. "Everything President Trump said today is simply wrong, end of story," the spokesman said. "He's wrong about the facts, wrong about the law, and sadly he's been wrong about how to use diplomacy to keep America safe." Dan De Luce is a reporter for the NBC News Investigative Unit.

"","Published: May 10, 2019 11:07 a.m. ET As U.S, edges toward confrontation, both sides should know a regional war would be hell By CANBERRA, Australia ( Project Syndicate) — Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power once called genocidal wars “a problem from hell.” As President Donald Trump’s administration ratchets up tensions with Iran, the world must now reckon with the prospect of a “confrontation from hell” between the two countries. For now, both the United States and Iran say they do not want a war. Yet, step by inexorable step, they are moving onto a collision course. The U.S. has significantly stepped up its military deployment in Iran’s neighborhood, dispatching the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier strike group and a bomber task force to the Middle East to warn the Iranian regime against taking any threatening actions. Iran’s leaders, meanwhile, have decried the move as psychological warfare and regard it as a provocation aimed at drawing their country into a military conflict. Since he took office, Trump has been relentless in his depiction of Iran as the source of all evil — including international terrorism — in the region and beyond. He has reversed his predecessor Barack Obama’s policy of engagement and is exerting maximum pressure on the Iranian regime with three objectives in mind. First and foremost, the Trump administration wants to bring about regime change, or at least a change in the regime’s behavior. It also seeks to degrade Iran’s economy so that the country can no longer be an influential regional player. And it wants to shore up Israel’s position as America’s most loyal and powerful ally in the Middle East, and to forge close strategic ties between the Jewish state and Arab countries opposed to Iran, including the Gulf states — led by Saudi Arabia — and Egypt. To achieve these objectives, Trump has withdrawn the U.S. from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). His administration has imposed harsh sanctions on Iran that affect every sector of its economy, leading some foreign companies to stop doing business with the country. And in an unprecedented move last month, Trump designated the key branch of Iran’s military forces, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, as a terrorist organization. Trump’s hawkish national security adviser, John Bolton, backed by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, recently said that: “The United States is not seeking war with the Iranian regime, but we are fully prepared to respond to any attack, whether by proxy, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or regular Iranian forces.” This takes the U.S. and Iran a step closer to a military confrontation that could be triggered either intentionally or by miscalculation. In the event of a war, Iran would not have the military capacity to stand up to American firepower. The U.S. could quickly take out Iranian military installations, nuclear sites, and major infrastructure facilities. In addition, it could prevent Iran from blocking the Strait of Hormuz, through which some 30% of the world’s oil is shipped. Yet Iran is capable of making any U.S. military assault — with or without Israeli and Saudi Arabian support — very costly for America and the region. The Iranian regime may be able to sink a few ships at the Strait of Hormuz’s narrowest point — where the shipping lanes in either direction are only two miles (3.2 kilometers) wide — in an effort to choke it off. More important, Iran has nurtured an asymmetric-warfare strategy based on both hard and soft power. Although Iran lacks a modern frontline air force, for example, it has made significant progress in developing and producing short-, medium- and long-range missiles, which have the capacity to hit targets as far away as Israel. Furthermore, the regime could target landmarks such as the Burj Khalifa in Dubai — the world’s tallest building ‒ in order to trigger a financial meltdown across the region. Even if the accuracy of Iranian missiles cannot be guaranteed, many of them could still evade defensive systems. Israel’s state-of-the-art Iron Dome anti-missile defenses, for example, have been unable even to neutralize all the primitive missiles launched from Gaza. Moreover, the Iranian regime has forged a network of proxy forces across the region. Syria and Iraq have become crucial links in an Iran-led Shia strategic arc stretching from Afghanistan to Lebanon. The regime’s proxy forces include segments of Afghanistan’s Shia population, Iraqi Shia militias, and Hezbollah, which controls southern Lebanon and has thousands of rockets ready to target Israel. Indeed, Hezbollah emerged from its 2006 war with Israel stronger than before. In addition, Iran can mobilize thousands of extremely dedicated suicide bombers to sacrifice themselves for the cause of Shia Islam and nationalism that the regime has successfully promoted. These bombers are embedded within the Iranian security forces, and across the region. The Iranian regime has worked hard to strengthen its national security within a supportive regional framework. In a conflict with the U.S., therefore, Iran would not be a pushover. On the contrary, any major military assault could result in an uncontrollable regional inferno. Both sides have good reason not to start a war.

"Spain Wants Nothing to Do With America’s Iran Strategy","The Spanish government on May 14, 2019 announced its navy would not, as previously planned, send a guided-missile frigate to join the battle group of the U.S. Navy aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln . The United States is already losing a close ally in its rush to justify military action against Iran. The Spanish government on May 14, 2019 announced its navy would not, as previously planned, send a guided-missile frigate to join the battle group of the U.S. Navy aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln . Washington in early May 2019 expedited  Lincoln ’s planned deployment to the Middle East after officials with the Trump administration claimed they had received intelligence indicating Iranian forces planned to attack American interests. “The U.S. government has taken a decision outside of the framework of what had been agreed with the Spanish navy,” Spain’s acting defense minister Margarita Robles told reporters in Brussels. In addition to speeding up Lincoln ’s deployment, the Pentagon also sent a contingent of U.S. Air Force B-52s to the Middle East as part of a wider build-up of forces in the region. The bombers on May 12, 2019 flew their first “deterrence” sorties near Iran. Air Force F-15C and F-35A fighters around the same time flew their own show-of-force missions. U.S. president Donald Trump’s national security advisor John Bolton, who has vowed to force regime change in Tehran, reportedly ordered acting defense secretary Patrick Shanahan to update plans for a possible war with Iran. The plan “envisions sending as many as 120,000 troops to the Middle East should Iran attack American forces or accelerate work on nuclear weapons,” The New York Times  reported . The planning documents “do not call for a land invasion of Iran, which would require vastly more troops, officials said.” The size of the force involved has shocked some who have been briefed on them. The 120,000 troops would approach the size of the American force that invaded Iraq in 2003. Deploying such a robust air, land and naval force would give Tehran more targets to strike, and potentially more reason to do so, risking entangling the United States in a drawn out conflict. It also would reverse years of retrenching by the American military in the Middle East that began with Pres. Barack Obama’s withdrawal of troops from Iraq in 2011. The government of Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly supplied the intelligence that the Trump administration used to justify, which routinely lies about basic facts, has not supplied to the public any evidence of a heightened threat from Iran. The administration has pointed to recent incidents that it claims were Iranian attacks on U.S. allies. Saudi and Emirati authorities claimed four oil tankers came under attack in the Persian Gulf on May 13, 2019 and all four suffered damage. U.S. military officials blame Iran, despite a lack of evidence that all four tankers indeed were damaged -- and that any damage was the result of an attack. A British general on May 14, 2019 insisted he had seen “no increased threat from Iranian-backed forces” in Iraq and Syria. Many recent attacks on Saudi oil infrastructure and shipping have been blamed on Houthi fighters from Yemen. Explosives-laden Houthi drones on May 14, 2019 reportedly damaged oil pipelines on Saudi soil. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates both are at war with the Houthis in Yemen. There is tenuous evidence that the Houthis receive some support from Iran. But there is no evidence that recent attacks on tankers and pipelines are part of a new and coordinated campaign by Iran to damage U.S. interests. The Trump administration for years has antagonized Iran. The administration in 2018 withdrew from the 2015 international agreement limiting Iran’s nuclear program. Iran in response pulled back from some aspects of the agreement, but with strong European support largely has continued to abide by its terms. Many observers in the United States fear the Trump White House wants war with Iran for political benefit or as part of an ideologically-motivated scheme to “remake” the Middle East. A scheme that would amount to a repeat of the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. “Similar to the George W. Bush administration’s justification for the war in Iraq, the Trump administration has presented the false narratives that Iran is not meeting its obligations under the nuclear deal and that it is somehow partially responsible for the rise of the Islamic State in Syria,” U.S. senators Tom Udall, a New Mexico Democrat, and Richard Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, warned in an op-ed. “It’s true that the leaders of Iran are deeply problematic. But if this were enough to justify war, other regimes in the region would also be in the United States’ crosshairs, instead of being recipients of U.S. military aid,” Udall and Durbin wrote, referring to oil-rich Saudi Arabia. Saudi money funds a vast network of extremist religious institutions that underpin modern Islamic terrorism. Trump has aligned himself with Saudi rulers and even exempted the country from an otherwise highly indiscriminate ban on people from many mostly-Muslim countries traveling to the United States.

"British special forces join US strike group against Iran","British Special Forces have flown to the Middle East in the framework of a top-secret mission to rebuff possible Iranian attacks on merchant ships, according to The Sun. Members of the elite Special Boat Service are reported to have joined UK registered oil tankers heading towards the Persian Gulf, subsequently to be tasked with monitoring Iranian military activity in the vicinity of Qesham Island, home to the country’s naval gunboats, the paper reports. Once the two SBS crews have passed through the Strait of Hormuz, reports claim Royal Navy Merlin helicopters operating out of Oman will airlift them off the vessels. The UK Ministry of Defence declined to respond when contacted by The Sun Online, with a spokesman stating they never comment about the Special Forces. The alleged military move comes shortly after the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier strike group arrived for patrols in the Arabian Sea. The US has already deployed the aircraft carrier and B-52 bombers to the Persian Gulf to counter alleged threats from Tehran, with the US planning to deploy as many as 120,000 troops to the Middle East should Iran attack American forces, a report claimed this week. However, US President Donald Trump is said to be increasingly favoring direct talk with Tehran as the best way forward, in a bid to comply with his long-standing pledge to withdraw the US from costly foreign wars, reports Washington Post. Trump had campaigned on avoiding overseas conflicts, but also on taking a tougher line on Iran. The Washington Post quoted a senior administration official as saying the US President is growing frustrated with what he sees as warlike planning generated by hawkish advisers. Hardline national security adviser John Bolton is a known foreign policy “hawk” and has long been advocating regime change in Iran. The paper cited several US officials saying Donald Trump prefers a diplomatic approach to resolving mounting tensions in the Middle East and wants to speak directly with Iran’s leaders. “He is not comfortable with all this “regime change” talk,” which to his ears echoes the discussion of removing Iraqi President Saddam Hussein before the 2003 US invasion,” the officials were reported as saying. In a Fox News interview on Sunday, US President Donald Trump said that the only sphere where he wants to “invade” is actually the economy, thereby downplaying fears of a conflict with Iran. He reiterated that he did not seek a war with Tehran, noting that the main thing he wanted was “not to let Iran have nuclear weapons”. “I am not somebody who wants to go into war because war kills (the) economy, kills people most importantly,” he added. However, Trump is willing to respond with force should there be American deaths or a dramatic escalation, added the official. “If Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran. Never threaten the United States again!” Trump tweeted on Sunday. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has said he does not believe a war will break out in the region amid concerns over rising tensions with the US. Speaking with the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) at the end of a visit to China on Saturday, he added that Tehran did not want a war, but that no country had the “idea or illusion that it can confront Iran”. US-Iranian tensions flared up last year when Washington unilaterally withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal and reinstated crippling sanctions against the country. On 8 May 2019, Iran announced its decision to partially discontinue its obligations under the deal. The United States, in turn, stepped up its military presence in the Middle East in what White House National Security Adviser John Bolton has called “a clear and unmistakable message to the Iranian regime”, sending a carrier strike group, Patriot missiles, B-52 bombers and F-15 fighters to the area, according to the Pentagon.

Members of the elite Special Boat Service are reported to have joined UK registered oil tankers heading towards the Persian Gulf, subsequently to be tasked with monitoring Iranian military activity in the vicinity of Qesham Island, home to the country's naval gunboats, the paper reports. Once the two SBS crews have passed through the Strait of Hormuz, reports claim Royal Navy Merlin helicopters operating out of Oman will airlift them off the vessels. The UK Ministry of Defence declined to respond when contacted by The Sun Online, with a spokesman stating they never comment about the Special Forces. The alleged military move comes shortly after the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier strike group arrived for patrols in the Arabian Sea. The US has already deployed the aircraft carrier and B-52 bombers to the Persian Gulf to counter alleged threats from Tehran, with the US planning to deploy as many as 120,000 troops to the Middle East should Iran attack American forces, a report claimed this week. However, US President Donald Trump is said to be increasingly favouring direct talk with Tehran as the best way forward, in a bid to comply with his long-standing pledge to withdraw the US from costly foreign wars, reports Washington Post. Trump had campaigned on avoiding overseas conflicts, but also on taking a tougher line on Iran. The Washington Post quoted a senior administration official as saying the US President is growing frustrated with what he sees as warlike planning generated by hawkish advisers. Hardline national security adviser John Bolton is a known foreign policy "hawk" and has long been advocating regime change in Iran. The paper cited several US officials saying Donald Trump prefers a diplomatic approach to resolving mounting tensions in the Middle East and wants to speak directly with Iran's leaders. “He is not comfortable with all this “regime change” talk,” which to his ears echoes the discussion of removing Iraqi President Saddam Hussein before the 2003 US invasion," the officials were reported as saying. In a Fox News interview on Sunday, US President Donald Trump said that the only sphere where he wants to "invade" is actually the economy, thereby downplaying fears of a conflict with Iran. He reiterated that he did not seek a war with Tehran, noting that the main thing he wanted was "not to let Iran have nuclear weapons". "I am not somebody who wants to go into war because war kills (the) economy, kills people most importantly," he added. However, Trump is willing to respond with force should there be American deaths or a dramatic escalation, added the official. "If Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran. Never threaten the United States again!" Trump tweeted on Sunday. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has said he does not believe a war will break out in the region amid concerns over rising tensions with the US. Speaking with the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) at the end of a visit to China on Saturday, he added that Tehran did not want a war, but that no country had the "idea or illusion that it can confront Iran". US-Iranian tensions flared up last year when Washington unilaterally withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal and reinstated crippling sanctions against the country. On 8 May 2019, Iran announced its decision to partially discontinue its obligations under the deal. The United States, in turn, stepped up its military presence in the Middle East in what White House National Security Adviser John Bolton has called "a clear and unmistakable message to the Iranian regime", sending a carrier strike group, Patriot missiles, B-52 bombers and F-15 fighters to the area, according to the Pentagon.

"Spain withdraws frigate from U.S. Mideast mission amid soaring Iran tensions","Sign In  Spanish naval commanders have pulled the country’s warships from the U.S.-led fleet dispatched to the Persian Gulf, reportedly to counter imminent Iranian threats to American forces in the region. Spanish Defense Minister Margarita Robles said Monday the NATO ally would withdraw the Mendez Nunez, a Alvaro de Bazan-class frigate from the U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier strike group en route to the Middle East. The Spanish frigate was part of a small European contingent attached to the Lincoln strike group, which had been initially assigned to a peacekeeping operation, before being reassigned to the Persian Gulf by U.S. commanders. The last-minute change to mission was a “ decision [made] outside of the framework of what had been agreed with the Spanish Navy,” said Mrs. Robles , Reuters reports.

"America versus Iran: Confrontation from hell","17 M/CLOUDY    CANBERRA - Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power once called genocidal wars “a problem from hell.” As U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration ratchets up tensions with Iran, the world must now reckon with the prospect of a “confrontation from hell” between the two countries. For now, both the United States and Iran say they do not want a war. Yet, step by inexorable step, they are moving onto a collision course. The U.S. has significantly stepped up its military deployment in Iran’s neighborhood, dispatching the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier strike group and a bomber task force to the Middle East to warn the Iranian regime against taking any threatening actions. Iran’s leaders, meanwhile, have decried the move as psychological warfare and regard it as a provocation aimed at drawing their country into a military conflict.  Since he took office, Trump has been relentless in his depiction of Iran as the source of all evil — including international terrorism — in the region and beyond. He has reversed his predecessor Barack Obama’s policy of engagement and is exerting maximum pressure on the Iranian regime with three objectives in mind. First and foremost, the Trump administration wants to bring about regime change, or at least a change in the regime’s behavior. It also seeks to degrade Iran’s economy so that the country can no longer be an influential regional player. And it wants to shore up Israel’s position as America’s most loyal and powerful ally in the Middle East, and to forge close strategic ties between the Jewish state and Arab countries opposed to Iran, including the Gulf states — led by Saudi Arabia — and Egypt. To achieve these objectives, Trump has withdrawn the U.S. from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). His administration has imposed harsh sanctions on Iran that affect every sector of its economy, leading some foreign companies to stop doing business with the country. And in an unprecedented move last month, Trump designated the key branch of Iran’s military forces, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, as a terrorist organization. Trump’s hawkish national security adviser, John Bolton, backed by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, recently said: “The United States is not seeking war with the Iranian regime, but we are fully prepared to respond to any attack, whether by proxy, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or regular Iranian forces.” This takes the U.S. and Iran a step closer to a military confrontation that could be triggered either intentionally or by miscalculation. In the event of a war, Iran would not have the military capacity to stand up to American firepower. The U.S. could quickly take out Iranian military installations, nuclear sites and major infrastructure facilities. In addition, it could prevent Iran from blocking the Strait of Hormuz, through which some 30 percent of the world’s oil is shipped. Yet Iran is capable of making any U.S. military assault — with or without Israeli and Saudi Arabian support — very costly for America and the region. The Iranian regime may be able to sink a few ships at the Strait of Hormuz’s narrowest point — where the shipping lanes in either direction are only 3.2 kilometers wide — in an effort to choke it off. More important, Iran has nurtured an asymmetric warfare strategy based on both hard and soft power. Although Iran lacks a modern frontline air force, for example, it has made significant progress in developing and producing short-, medium- and long-range missiles that have the capacity to hit targets as far away as Israel. Furthermore, the regime could target landmarks such as the Burj Khalifa in Dubai — the world’s tallest building — in order to trigger a financial meltdown across the region. Even if the accuracy of Iranian missiles cannot be guaranteed, many of them could still evade defensive systems. Israel’s state-of-the-art Iron Dome anti-missile defenses, for example, have been unable even to neutralize all the primitive missiles launched from Gaza. Moreover, the Iranian regime has forged a network of proxy forces across the region. Syria and Iraq have become crucial links in an Iran-led Shiite strategic arc stretching from Afghanistan to Lebanon. The regime’s proxy forces include segments of Afghanistan’s Shiite population, Iraqi Shiite militias and Hezbollah, which controls southern Lebanon and has thousands of rockets ready to target Israel. Indeed, Hezbollah emerged from its 2006 war with Israel stronger than before. In addition, Iran can mobilize thousands of extremely dedicated suicide bombers to sacrifice themselves for the cause of Shiite Islam and nationalism that the regime has successfully promoted. These bombers are embedded within the Iranian security forces, and across the region. The Iranian regime has worked hard to strengthen its national security within a supportive regional framework. In a conflict with the U.S., therefore, Iran would not be a pushover. On the contrary, any major military assault could result in an uncontrollable regional inferno. Both sides have good reason not to start a war.

"The Hidden Sources of Iranian Strength","Argument:  The Hidden Sources of Iranian Strength  The Hidden Sources of Iranian Strength...  “What Americans don’t understand is that the groups that we support in the region are not our mercenaries,” Ali, a high-ranking member of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), said when I recently asked him about one of the stated goals of the Trump administration’s sanctions against Iran: to curtail the country’s ability to financially support militias in the region. He continued, “The Americans think everything is about money. They think we buy loyalty in the region, because that’s how they buy loyalty.” In the decade that I did research with cultural producers in Iran’s preeminent military force, the IRGC, I saw a steady flow of filmmakers loyal to Hezbollah and Iraqi Shiite and Kurdish groups travel through regime cultural centers in Tehran. (They all agreed to speak with me on the condition of anonymity. The first names used here are pseudonyms.) Mehdi, an Iranian pro-regime filmmaker, had lived in Lebanon to make films with Hezbollah media producers. When they visited him in Tehran, they spoke fluent Persian and navigated the city with familiar ease. Iraqi filmmakers would regularly come to spend time in Tehran at editing studios tied to the paramilitary Basij organization. Although my research focused on cultural producers, I saw a similar flow of foreigners in the economic and military arms of the IRGC. The flow of goods, ideas, and people between Iran and its proxies is certain to continue amid President Donald Trump’s sanctions, facilitated by a spectrum of institutions that do not rely on heavy financial investments and by enduring friendships on all sides. Historically, the connections between Iran, Iraq, and the Levant go back generations. Long-standing trade and pilgrimage routes, as well as a constellation of religious seminaries, meant that communities and entire families seamlessly traveled, lived, conversed, and created cultural and social ties. The mere existence of these ties, however, does not translate into politically active groups. Policymakers and the public misunderstand the nature of these ties, explaining them as ones bound by Shiism as a traditional, religious doctrine. This misunderstanding arises from a fundamentally flawed framework that undergirds Washington’s entire Iran and Middle East policy—a belief that what drove the 1979 revolution in Iran was a fanatical quest for Islamic politics. But what actually binds these groups together is not an adherence to specific theological doctrine—if that were the case, Iran would not have close relationships with certain Palestinian factions, nor with Iraqi Kurdish groups, to say nothing of ties to Bashar al-Assad in Syria or the Houthis in Yemen. In order to understand how a political quest for sovereignty, rather than an otherworldly quest for religious rule, animates Iran’s relations with its proxies, it is first necessary to unpack current assumptions about the revolution that led to the Islamic Republic. In a newly emerging generation of scholarship aimed at constructing a social history of the revolution, research shows that what motivated Iranians to support the revolution en masse was a desire to rid the country of imperialism. As a prominent historian of Iran, Ervand Abrahamian has argued that the 1979 revolution should be seen as a continuation of the national struggle for liberation that was cut short in 1953 by a U.S.-orchestrated coup. In a first for the CIA, the United States deposed democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadeq, reinstated Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, and took control of Iran’s oil fields. Domestically, no matter what the shah did in that 26-year interim between 1953 and 1979, the coup cast its long shadow over his rule. His perceived illegitimacy was tied to the sentiment that he did the bidding of the Americans and Brits and sold out his country’s national integrity for power and wealth. As the historian Naghmeh Sohrabi argues , the 1979 revolution in Iran should be understood “as one of the last great successful revolutions of the post-colonial world and in its post-revolutionary shape, as one of the first to answer the questions and anxieties of its global south ethos in an Islamic form.” Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, with his drab clerical garb and non-Tehrani-accented Persian, was the symbolic opposite of the opulent wealth of the shah. Khomeini’s populist message to restore justice and integrity to Iran in the face of international and domestic humiliation resonated with a population that, despite the great oil wealth of the 1970s, remained largely poor and rural. A massive popular revolution from below drove out the shah not just because of economic, cultural, or political shortcomings (those existed in other countries too but did not result in a revolutionary movement) but rather because revolutionaries cast the shah as an American puppet who did not have the best interests of the nation in mind. The core issues of the revolution were sovereignty and independence from outside powers. Now, what does this have to do with Iran’s relationship with its proxies? In the 40 years since the revolution, the Islamic Republic has supported groups that are actively engaged in struggles against foreign occupation, whether in Lebanon, Iraq, or the occupied Palestinian territories. (This analysis also drove its policies in Syria, where it believed the United States, Europe, and Israel were using domestic groups, and later mercenaries, to topple Assad for geopolitical purposes.) When one pays close attention to the discourse of these groups, from their official statements to their media output, the emphasis is on sovereignty and the fight against imperialism. Of course the symbolism of Islam as a cultural and political identity is also present, but it is not the driving force. “The Americans think we’re crazed Muslims on a path of martyrdom and that Iraqis and Lebanese have this same crazed mentality,” said Hossein, an IRGC commander during the Iran-Iraq War and now a media producer. “They don’t want to think that we have legitimate political concerns that are about a region free from imperial domination and a quest to control our resources.” Mehdi, the Iranian filmmaker who has spent years living and working in Lebanon with Hezbollah media producers, said, “I joined the revolutionary forces because I wanted to be like Dr. Chamran. What he did for the Lebanese and Palestinians, and later for Iran, that’s what drove so many of us.” Mehdi referred to one of the main early strategists of the revolutionary armed forces of Iran, as well as the first defense minister of the revolutionary government, Mostafa Chamran. A University of California, Berkeley-educated physicist who was deeply involved in the anti-colonial movements of the 1960s and 1970s, Chamran trained in guerrilla tactics in Cuba and Egypt and worked in Lebanon to organize Shiites in the 1970s. Mehdi and his Lebanese collaborators have created films about Chamran and big public education programs to teach their younger generations about this military leader. The military tactics of the 1970s anti-colonial movements were built into the DNA of the IRGC and, by extension, into the DNA of militias Iran backs in the region. These asymmetrical warfare tactics were tested in battle over an eight-year period during the Iran-Iraq War. From 1980 to 1988, the IRGC learned how to fight, create military strategy, and withstand a superior military force funded and supplied by the West. Like many anti-colonial movements of that time, the Iranian revolution did not lead to liberation but a bloody struggle for power that eventually suppressed dissenting voices. In the four decades since its establishment, the Islamic Republic and the IRGC have practiced heavy-handed politics that have resulted in deep wounds that will not be easily forgiven. Yet among supporters of the Islamic Republic, both internally and externally, the Iranian post-revolutionary government remains legitimate and a cause worth fighting alongside precisely because it has been able to thwart U.S. aggression in Iraq and Afghanistan; because it fought against the Islamic State, largely leading to its defeat; and because its support of Hezbollah has helped keep Israel out of Lebanon. Since the Trump administration has come to power, U.S. foreign policy has reverted back to strong-arm politics that seek to bully those who will not fall in line. In the Middle East, it is not just Iran that the United States has gone after. In light of the recent annexation of the Golan Heights and the granting of drilling rights to a company linked to Dick Cheney , as well as wider support of Benjamin Netanyahu’s expansionist policies in the occupied Palestinian territories, the wider desire among the American and Israeli right to control, and profit off of, natural resources in the Middle East is not lost on any of these groups, especially Hezbollah, but also various Iraqi groups that are concerned about control over their oil fields. For its supporters, Iran’s current predicament in the face of a U.S. administration that demands the country’s submission—even though it held up its end of the bargain—rhymes too perfectly with historical precedent to ignore. Domestically, despite widespread frustration with the regime, the quest for nuclear energy has been cast as a national right in Iran for decades. In my research, I have traced how the IRGC has cultivated a nationalist message in all of its cultural and media programming since at least 2005. Given the Trump administration’s actions against Iranians, from the so-called Muslim ban to withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal to designating the IRGC a foreign terrorist organization—effecting millions of young men who have served their mandatory military service under the IRGC—the Islamic Republic does not need to work too hard to make a case for national unity under these circumstances. Instead, the biggest outcome will be a militarized domestic sphere that will suppress dissenting voices even more in the face of an outside aggressor. In the past months since the devastating floods that hit nearly all corners of Iran, Iraqi, Afghan, and Lebanese filmmakers tied to the various militia groups in the region have been in Iran making news pieces and documentaries about the work of the IRGC and Iranian paramilitary groups in flooding assistance. This media output has been framed as a need for solidarity across the region with Iran as it faces natural disasters and the Trump administration. Throughout the region, even in societies at odds with Iran, these groups have successfully cast the suffering of Yemenis as an issue the Saudis have perpetuated. The media arms of these groups, which disseminate material in Arabic and Kurdish (in a variety of local dialects), do not have the massive budget of Saudi or Emirati media operations in the region. Yet, just like their military tactics on the ground, these groups have created an effective asymmetrical communications operation. U.S. officials may hope that sanctions will curtail Iran’s ability to fund these groups, but in their hope, they reveal their naiveté about two areas: First, through indigenous funding networks like khums and other kinds of tithes, money will continue to flow to these groups through a complex system of hawalas that will be hard for the U.S. Treasury Department to track; and second, the desire to rid the region of a foreign imperial power is a cause that has galvanized populations in the Middle East for generations. Money is not the main defining factor of such a cause. Narges Bajoghli is an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University’s School of Advanced International Studies.

"The Emir and the Tsar: Kuwait Turns to Russia as Trump Clashes With Iran","Nicolai Due-Gundersen   As outlets discuss whether Iran’s Nuclear Deal is finished , a proximate Gulf state asserts its right to develop nuclear capacity. For Trump, such an assertion may be worrying. After all, Kuwait is considered a traditional US ally, yet amid American concerns of a nuclear Iran and squabbles with Putin , Kuwait is considering nuclear ambitions with Russian support.  As early as 2010, while Iran faced renewed UN sanctions for its nuclear progress, Kuwait and Russia signed an MoU to jointly develop Kuwait’s nuclear energy capacities, including through mutual uranium exploration . This MoU was expanded upon in 2017, when Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak boasted that Kuwait may construct a nuclear energy plant with Russian assistance . Both Kuwait and Russia are pragmatic on the world stage.  “Monarchy,” he insists, “was a legacy passed down from the Empire to Soviet times, even though the  plaque on the building changed.” Putin sums up such pragmatism best when discussing how Russian foreign relations are at the core of its political history. “Monarchy,” he insists, “was a legacy passed down from the Empire to Soviet times, even though the plaque on the building changed .” Putin himself is a product of Soviet pragmatism. As Russia’s Tsar will do business with Arab royals, so too will Kuwait assess its political options. Despite events thanking Bush Senior for his Gulf War leadership, Kuwait does not base its future on the past. The Gulf War is over and thanks to Trump’s fragmented foreign policies, Putin has won the Cold War . Trump’s declarations that Jerusalem and the Golan Heights are Israeli territory punctuate a US administration losing credibility in the Middle East, a fact that Russia is more than aware of.  Last month, Russia joined Turkey and Iran in condemning US recognition of the Golan . As the US considers withdrawal, Russia sees its opportunity to become a dominant and active power.  Trump’s declarations that Jerusalem and the Golan Heights are Israeli territory punctuate a US administration losing credibility in the Middle East, a fact that Russia is more than aware of. Kuwait-Russian relations began as early as the 19th Century, with Kuwait receiving military vessels of the Russian Empire. Kuwait was the first Arab monarchy to recognize the USSR. Putin’s overtures toward the small oil state are thus building on long-standing mutual history rather than solely regional tensions. And let’s not forget the mutual interest of energy. A 2015 MoU signed between Russia’s hydrocarbon giant Gazprom and the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation emphasized that relations between the two states are being cemented through energy and economic benefits. Ali Al-Ghanim, President of Kuwait’s Chamber of Commerce declared that deepening this partnership should result in mutual investment opportunities . However, energy access and geopolitics are a dominant theme in such mutual relations. “Russian-Gulf energy relations are significant because both parties have a common interest in monetizing the value of [oil and gas] in a world that increasingly privileges low-carbon energy,” explains Professor Li-Chen Sim of Zayed University (UAE). This is very true for the Gulf as a whole but Kuwait especially, which is struggling to emulate the Dubai framework of economic diversification through tourism and Western business models. Oil and gas are the only commodities. “Keeping the world supplied with fossil fuels extends the hydrocarbon age and its centrality to modern lifestyles,” continues Li-Chen Sim. Such dependence on hydrocarbons is how Gulf States lavish citizens with material rewards and prepare for a post-oil era. Russia, on the other hand, can combine the domestic peace oil prices can bring with Gulf investments in Russia’s declining oil fields. New fields must be developed to offset peaking ones, and it is with Gulf wealth that Putin plans to do it.  Kuwait-Russian relations began as early as the 19th Century, with Kuwait receiving military vessels of the Russian Empire. Kuwait was the first Arab monarchy to recognize the USSR. Putin’s overtures toward the small oil state are thus building on long-standing mutual history rather than solely regional tensions. For both Russia and Kuwait, their relations also have the impact of diversifying away from Western markets, including America. By 2016, Russia’s foreign energy investments into Asia saw it replace Saudi Arabia as China’s top crude oil supplier. Kuwait’s growing relations with Russia also connect with its Chinese relations. Kuwait’s trade agreements with its Asian counterpart are intended to strengthen Eurasian ties and Kuwait’s economic diversification without Western reliance. Kuwait is not alone, as the GCC is turning toward Asia rather than the US or Britain for oil trade and investment. “Asia has developed into the world’s centre for the manufacturing of exported goods,” argues energy analyst Walid Khadurri of The Arab Weekly. “The GCC is the world’s top region for energy export. Asia needs energy to fuel its manufacturing export industry and the GCC needs markets for its growing exports. The two regions’ goals complement each other.” As a smaller Gulf State, Kuwait can use its Russian relations to bolster access to China through a partner that has greater political clout, being active not only in the Middle East but a member of the Eurasian security forum The Shanghai Cooperation  Organization, of which Russia and China are the largest members.  “The GCC is the world’s top region for energy export. Asia needs energy to fuel its manufacturing export industry and the GCC needs markets for its growing exports. The two regions’ goals complement each other.” Ironically, the collapse of an Iranian Nuclear Deal may keep Kuwait’s oil prices high . With Russia itself under threat of sanctions , Putin was no doubt satisfied that Iran’s problems also gained Russia a spike in its own oil prices . If anything, Kuwait’s and Russia’s energy gains augment a partnership away from the West that can ride Iranian containment, GCC diversification and a history based on mutual interest.  Kuwait is balancing its US relations with Russian friendship during a period of tension in the region. However, a pragmatic Emir no doubt appreciates a pragmatic Tsar. As the US considers winding down Middle East intervention, Russia is willing to fill the vacuum. Kuwait and the whole Gulf is happy to welcome the change. © 2000 - 2019 Al Bawaba (www.albawaba.com)  View the discussion thread.

"Japan, China to hold disarmament talks for 1st time in 8 yrs","May 18, 2019 (Mainichi Japan) TOKYO (Kyodo) -- Japan and China are arranging to hold bilateral talks on nuclear disarmament and nonproliferation for the first time in eight years, government sources in Tokyo said Friday, in the latest sign of thawing bilateral ties.  During the talks likely to be held Tuesday in Beijing, Japan is expected to call on China to reduce its nuclear weapons and increase transparency of its holdings, the sources said.  China, whose weaponry includes intercontinental ballistic missiles and submarine-launched ballistic missiles, may take issue with Japan's disarmament and nonproliferation policy that depends on the U.S. nuclear umbrella, according to the sources.  The two sides are also expected to exchange views on North Korea's nuclear and missile development as well as Iran's nuclear ambitions following Tehran's recent decision to suspend some of its commitments under a 2015 international nuclear deal in response to Washington's withdrawal from the accord and reintroduction of sanctions. China is part of the accord.  Tomoyuki Yoshida, director general of the Japanese Foreign Ministry's disarmament, nonproliferation and science department, will take part in the meeting also attended by senior Chinese officials.  Sino-Japanese relations were frayed over issues related to wartime history and territory but have been improving in recent months.  Following Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's visit to China last October, Chinese President Xi Jinping is scheduled to make his first visit as president to Japan next month.  Since Abe's trip to China, the two governments have been exploring the resumption of the bilateral framework launched in 1999 to discuss disarmament and nonproliferation, the sources said.  The previous round was held in 2011 before relations took a drastic turn for the worse in 2012 when Japan put the Japan-administered Senkaku Islands, claimed by China, in the East China Sea under state control.

Amash, the libertarian-leaning lawmaker, doubled down on his weekend claim that the president engaged in impeachable conduct and has since been the center of speculation about a possible 2020 challenge to the president on the Libertarian Party ticket.  As Jonathan Easley reported , buzz is building that Amash will leave the Republican Party to launch a bid. Earlier this year, Amash left the door open to a Libertarian Party run and he has repeatedly expressed frustration with the GOP for abandoning its conservative principles to bend for Trump.  His statement over the weekend that he believed Trump committed impeachable offenses energized and united the “Never Trump” Republicans, who have been unable to recruit a candidate of their own, and prominent libertarians.  Since those remarks, Trump and his top allies have gone on the attack on his behalf. Additionally, GOP leaders are poo-pooing the idea that Amash could be a spoiler for the president, particularly in Michigan, which the president won in 2016 by just north of 10,000 votes ( The Hill ).  McCarthy , who left the door open to supporting a challenger if Amash runs for his House seat again, downplayed impact Amash may have on the 2020 scene and questioned whether anyone there has even heard of him before this past weekend.  “How many people know Justin Amash? ” McCarthy asked reporters. “ The only people I saw come up and congratulate him [tonight] were Democrats.

The Washington Post : Republicans caught between Trump and reluctance to penalize Amash after “impeachable conduct” declaration.     WHITE HOUSE & ADMINISTRATION: Former White House Counsel Don McGahn will not appear on Capitol Hill on Tuesday and plans to “respect the president’s instruction” to defy a congressional subpoena, setting off a new round of calls to get the ball rolling on impeachment proceedings against the president.

The impeachment question is also pressuring Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who continues to dismiss the possibility. According to Politico , Cicilline and two other Democratic member pressed her to move forward on impeachment proceedings, which she, along with multiple leadership allies, rejected immediately.     > U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta blocked Trump’s bid to withhold from House Democratic investigators his financial records held by an accounting firm he retained as a New York businessman, giving House Democrats a victory in their bid to unearth a trove of financial information about the president.  Trump panned the decision, pointing to Mehta being a judge appointed by former President Obama in 2014 and calling it “crazy.”  Trump's attorneys filed a lawsuit last month seeking to block Mazars USA, an accounting firm, from complying with a subpoena for years of documents related to the House Oversight Committee's investigation into claims that Trump inflated or deflated financial statements for potentially improper purposes ( NBC News ).

"Trying to Kill the Iran Deal Could End Up Saving It","Trump administration officials are publicly united on their policy of punishing the Islamic Republic. But cracks are showing over just how far to go. The Trump administration has made a priority of punishing and pressuring Iran. But the same administration that withdrew from the nuclear deal that President Donald Trump dubbed “a great embarrassment” may actually end up preserving it. Iran and all the other signatories are still observing the deal’s terms for now. The U.S. reimposed sanctions on the Islamic Republic last fall, driving down its oil exports and further stressing its weak economy. But even as the administration pursues what it calls a “maximum pressure” campaign against the country, it has also made exceptions through sanctions waivers that have helped keep Iranian oil flowing and even preserved some international nuclear cooperation with the country. Now, ahead of a key deadline in May, the administration is sending conflicting signals about just how far it plans to go to confront the regime. At issue, in part, is the stated intent to choke off Iran’s oil exports entirely and throttle its oil-dependent economy. Following through could mean fights with allies that import Iranian oil, or even a higher risk that Iran ditches the deal altogether and starts racing to a nuclear weapon. Backing off the promise could leave the deal limping along for a potential new president to reenter it, as the Democratic Party has called for . While Trump-administration officials are all singing from the same hawkish hymnal about the march to zero exports, cracks are beginning to show. State Department officials say they are not “looking to grant” new waivers when the current round expires around May 4, but won’t comment on renewing existing ones; they hedge about getting to zero “as soon as possible” and the need to avoid disrupting oil markets. Representatives from the Department of Energy and the National Security Council (NSC) have meanwhile pointed to data showing that oil markets are well supplied enough to keep prices stable, even with the loss of Iranian crude. “We’re not very worried about it,” a Department of Energy spokesperson told me. “We think the market will balance itself out.” Hawks in Congress seem to agree. “If our policy objective is zero, our policy should be doing its damnedest to get to zero,” one Republican congressional staffer familiar with the interagency discussions told me. “My sense is we’re not. There is hedging.” This person and another source familiar with the discussions said the disconnect is fueling an interagency argument between members of the State Department and the NSC as the deadline approaches. Asked for comment on the purported disagreement, a spokesperson for the NSC said, “The National Security Council coordinates closely across the interagency to apply maximum economic pressure against Iran.” A State Department spokesman also did not comment directly on the interagency disconnect, but offered a statement from Brian Hook, the U.S. special representative for Iran, reiterating the policy to get to zero and noting that “we have already achieved significant reductions in Iran’s exports.” There’s public unity, at any rate, about forcing change in Iran. Trump has directly threatened Iranian President Hassan Rouhani via tweet, vowing “CONSEQUENCES THE LIKES OF WHICH FEW THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAVE EVER SUFFERED BEFORE” should Rouhani threaten the United States. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has vowed “unprecedented financial pressure on the Iranian regime.” National Security Adviser John Bolton has dubbed Iran the “central banker of terrorism” and noted, “That’s not behavior we should tolerate.” Hook said in his statement to The Atlantic that sanctions on Iran are “draining their resources to fund terrorism.” Yet there’s also discord beneath the surface. Hook spent months negotiating with the Europeans to preserve a version of a deal that Trump would accept, only to have the president announce his withdrawal last May. At a recent conference in Warsaw, Vice President Mike Pence publicly demanded that the Europeans leave the deal, reportedly infuriating Pompeo, who has made no such demands. Hook has consistently reiterated the zero-exports goal, but he also told a conference this week that Trump “doesn’t want to shock oil markets,” even as he acknowledged market surpluses. In a sign of the interagency disconnect, Richard Goldberg, director for countering Iranian weapons of mass destruction at the NSC, said, “The oil market is well supplied and can absorb the loss of Iranian crude,” speaking at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies last month. Projections from the Energy Information Administration released this week show the same thing , even accounting for losses of Venezuelan oil exports due to additional U.S. sanctions. Trump’s exit from the Iran deal last year came with some caveats. The basic framework of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), as the pact is formally known, was an exchange of economic incentives, including a suspension of past sanctions, for Iranian nuclear restraint. Ahead of reimposing sanctions on Iranian oil exports, though, Trump gave Iran’s trading partners about six months to make other arrangements, and bargained with Saudi Arabia to increase oil production to keep prices stable. But the idea was that any country still importing Iranian oil by that November would be sanctioned. Iran’s exports began declining even before then, as countries fled the possibility of financial punishment. And even as Trump worried about prices, Energy Secretary Rick Perry was sanguine about the issue on the op-ed page of The Wall Street Journal : “The U.S. Energy Information Administration expects global oil supply to meet demand in 2019 even without Iranian oil.” So it was a surprise that the deadline came and Trump handed out some sanctions exceptions, including to China, Taiwan, India, and South Korea, granting them access to Iranian oil for another six months without penalty. The markets didn’t see it coming; oversupply resulted; prices dropped . Over the period since Trump announced he was leaving the Iran deal, though, Iran’s oil exports have fallen by more than half, from more than 2.5 million barrels per day to about a million barrels per day. But neither Hook nor Pompeo will specify over what time period they hope to get to zero. Asked at an energy conference this week whether it was even possible to get there, Pompeo would only say, “I’m not going to get ahead of myself or ahead of the president, but make no mistake about it, that’s the direction of travel.” Meanwhile, Reuters has reported that the United States is leaving the door open for waivers, even if at a reduced number. Japanese and South Korean officials have stated publicly that they’re seeking them; outside analysts have also suggested that China is a likely candidate, given how much Iranian oil it currently imports and its ongoing trade negotiations with the United States. Sources in India have told reporters that that country, too, is engaged in waiver negotiations with the U.S. Hook is adamant that “maximum pressure” means just that. “The United States is not looking to grant any exceptions or waivers to our campaign of maximum economic pressure on the Iranian regime,” his statement said. “Our policy is to get to zero imports of Iranian crude as quickly as possible.” But Hook’s comments about oil markets leave room for maneuver, and they echo concerns that Trump raised before granting oil-sanctions waivers last time. Leaving aside possible geopolitical or diplomatic reasons to grant waivers—say, to avoid having to sanction an ally such as South Korea, or to sweeten trade negotiations with China—the oil-prices rationale conflicts with the analyses of other agencies. Energy Department projections say the market has 2 million barrels per day of spare production capacity—more than enough to replace a million lost barrels of Iranian oil per day if needed. The price spike feared last fall has not come to pass. When the Energy Information Administration published its latest projections this past week, the price of oil was $64 a barrel—right about where it was this time last year, though oil prices fluctuate. “If you know the oil markets right now, you know that price is not a factor,” said Amos Hochstein, President Barack Obama’s international-energy special envoy, who managed Iran sanctions. By contrast, in the first two years of Iranian oil sanctions under Obama, he said oil prices were more than $100 a barrel. Still, technical problems will complicate the push to zero Iranian exports. China, for example, is still importing roughly half a million barrels of Iranian oil per day. “It is difficult to sanction China on this issue,” Hochstein said. “They have financial institutions that can facilitate the oil trade that are not engaged in the U.S. financial market, and therefore [are] immune to sanctions.” Separately, however, the administration has used sanctions waivers in other ways. At a conference in December, Christopher Ford, the assistant secretary of state for international security and nonproliferation, noted that even as the administration sought to sanction Iran to drive it to negotiate a better deal, they were seeking to preserve some international cooperation with Iran on things such as civil nuclear research and energy projects. The waivers basically prevent the Europeans from facing sanctions for participating in projects allowed under the deal. There, too, the effect, if not the intent, of the waivers could be to keep in place parts of the basic framework of the deal Trump vowed to eliminate. “We don’t agree that we should have maximum pressure right now, considering that we want the Iranians to stay in the nuclear deal,” said a Democratic congressional aide. “But if you’re going to have maximum pressure, then waivers don’t work.” Even if a Democrat won the White House in 2020, though, he or she might not think it wise to reenter the JCPOA as it currently stands. Robert Einhorn, who helped negotiate the nuclear deal in the Obama administration, noted that some key provisions would expire not long after a hypothetical Democrat took office in 2021. Besides, Iran is, according to the public assessment of the U.S. intelligence community, still abiding by the terms of the deal under current U.S. sanctions—what’s the political benefit of giving up sanctions leverage right off the bat? Richard Nephew, who was the sanctions expert for Obama’s negotiating team with Iran, told me that even if a Democrat made a tactical decision to reenter the deal, “we’ve got to figure out a way to deal with the lost time.” The current terms of the JCPOA, he said, are “rapidly becoming not worth it.” Administration officials have repeatedly said that they seek not regime change but behavior change, and that their goal is to drive the Iranians to the table to strike a better deal. But critics of the “maximum pressure” policy I spoke to, whether or not they supported the Iran deal initially, all agree on one thing: Iran is prepared to wait out the next two years of the Trump administration. “Absent an unforeseen U.S. sweetener, I believe Iran is willing to wait,” Hochstein said. “They’re willing to take the pain. They’ve demonstrated that. They’ve had bad times before.” We want to hear what you think about this article. Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com.

"Iran nuclear deal: What is it?","This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten,

      All market data delayed 20 minutes. Who gets what and at what price? A look at the controversial Iran Nuclear Deal. Calling it "decaying and rotten," President Trump announced he is withdrawing the U.S. from the Iran nuclear deal and will be imposing more sanctions on the Middle Eastern nation. Trump signed a presidential memorandum on May 8 withdrawing the U.S. from the controversial agreement signed by his predecessor in 2015. He said he will be re-instituting the highest level of sanctions and warned other countries against helping the Iranian government. Trump said the U.S. would "not be held hostage to nuclear blackmail" and will not allow "a regime that chants 'death to America'" to get nuclear weapons. The nuclear deal with Iran has long been a point of contention, especially among Republicans who opposed it. The administration extended waivers on Iran’s nuclear sanctions earlier this year, keeping alive the landmark deal for an additional few months. Read on for a look at the agreement and why it’s so controversial. Members of the Iranian delegation listen as President Donald Trump speaks during the United Nations General Assembly in New York. (AP Photo/Mary Altaffer) The Iran nuclear deal framework – officially the "Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action" – was a historic agreement reached by Iran and several world powers, including the U.S., in 2015, under Barack Obama’s presidency. In part, the deal was made to reduce Iran’s ability to produce two components used in making nuclear weapons: plutonium and uranium. In return, crippling economic sanctions on Iran were to be abated. "Every pathway to a nuclear weapon is cut off," Obama said at the time. "This deal is not built on trust. It is built on verification." A point of contention for many opponents is the deal's so-called “sunset clause” which would ease some of the restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program over time. The deal was reached after two years of negotiations. Certification that Iran is complying with the deal must be sent to Congress every 90 days. The first under the Trump administration noted that Tehran was in compliance. In October 2017, Trump decertified the nuclear deal under U.S. law, saying the sanctions relief was disproportionate to Iran's nuclear concessions. He contended the arrangement was contrary to America's national security interests. During the presidential campaign, Trump accused Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, then his opponent, for making Iran a “world power” under the nuclear deal, which he called “the highest level of incompetence.” “If you take a look at Iran from four, five years ago, they were dying,” Trump said during an event in September 2016. “They had sanctions, they were being choked to death and they were dying. They weren’t even going to be much of a threat.” On Twitter, Trump has referred to the agreement as “a direct national security threat,” a “catastrophe that must be stopped,” the “dumbest & most dangerous misjudgments ever entered into in history of our country” and “the best deal of any kind in history” for Iran. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has warned the U.S. would pay a “high cost” if it backs out of the agreement. Trump is expected to reimpose all sanctions on Iran that were lifted as part of the 2015 deal, according to the Treasury Department. These sanctions include precious metals, banknotes, shipping, the automotive sector and petroleum. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said the agreement could survive without the participation of the U.S., but has warned that his country would restart enriching uranium "in the next weeks." If that happens, and the deal collapses completely, businesses and banks doing business with Iran would have to scramble to extricate themselves or run afoul of the U.S. Oil markets are also on the alert following Trump's decision. However, analysts told CNBC the impact of the reimposed sanctions might not have the same impact it once did. And while some countries may limit their oil purchases from Iran out of respect to the U.S., there are other countries that might refuse to do so, according to CNBC.

"President Obama’s full remarks announcing a ‘framework’ for a nuclear deal with Iran","OBAMA: Good afternoon, everybody. Today, the United States, together with our allies and partners, has reached a historic understanding with Iran, which, if fully implemented, will prevent it from obtaining a nuclear weapon. As president and commander in chief, I have no greater responsibility than the security of the American people, and I am convinced that if this framework leads to a final, comprehensive deal, it will make our country, our allies, and our world safer. This has been a long time coming. The Islamic Republic of Iran has been advancing its nuclear program for decades. By the time I took office, Iran was operating thousands of centrifuges, which can produce the materials for a nuclear bomb. And Iran was concealing a covert nuclear facility. I made clear that we were prepared to resolve this issue diplomatically, but only if Iran came to the table in a serious way. When that did not happen, we rallied the world to impose the toughest sanctions in history, sanctions which had a profound impact on the Iranian economy. Now, sanctions alone could not stop Iran's nuclear program, but they did help bring Iran to the negotiating table. Because of our diplomatic efforts, the world stood with us, and we were joined at the negotiating table by the world's major powers: the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia and China as well as the European Union. [ Congress reacts with cautious optimism, renewed skepticism ] Over a year ago, we took the first step towards today's framework with a deal to stop the progress of Iran's nuclear program and roll it back in key areas. And recall that at the time, skeptics argued that Iran would cheat, that we could not verify their compliance, and the interim agreement would fail. Instead, it has succeeded exactly as intended. Iran has met all of its obligations. It eliminated its stockpile of dangerous nuclear material, inspections of Iran's program increased, and we continued negotiations to see if we could achieve a more comprehensive deal. Today, after many months of tough principle diplomacy, we have achieved the framework for that deal. And it is a good deal, a deal that meets our core objectives. This framework would cut off every pathway that Iran could take to develop a nuclear weapon. Iran will face strict limitations on its program, and Iran has also agreed to the most robust and intrusive inspections and transparency regime ever negotiated for any nuclear program in history. So this deal is not based on trust. It's based on unprecedented verification. Many key details will be finalized over the next three months. And nothing is agreed to until everything is agreed. But here are the basic outlines of the deal that we are working to finalize. First, Iran will not be able to pursue a bomb using plutonium because it will not develop weapons grade plutonium. The core of its reactor at Arak will be dismantled and replaced. The spent fuel from that facility will be shipped out of Iran for the life of the reactor. Iran will not build a new heavy water reactor. And Iran will not reprocess fuel from its existing reactors, ever. Second, this deal shuts down Iran's path to a bomb using enriched uranium. Iran has agreed that its installed centrifuges will be reduced by two thirds. Iran will no longer enrich uranium at its Fordo facility. Iran will not enrich uranium with its advanced centrifuges for at least the next 10 years. The vast majority of Iran's stockpile of enriched uranium will be neutralized. Today, estimates indicate that Iran is only two or three months away from potentially acquiring the raw materials that could be used for a single nuclear bomb. Under this deal, Iran has agreed that it will not stockpile the materials needed to build a weapon. Even if it violated the deal, for the next decade at least, Iran would be a minimum of a year away from acquiring enough material for a bomb. And the strict limitations on Iran's stockpile will last for 15 years. Third, this deal provides the best possible defense against Iran's ability to pursue a nuclear weapon covertly, that is in secret. International inspectors will have unprecedented access not only to Iranian nuclear facilities, but to the entire supply chain that supports Iran's nuclear program, from uranium mills that provide the raw materials to the centrifuge production and storage facilities that support the program. If Iran cheats, the world will know it. If we see something suspicious, we will inspect it. Iran's past efforts to weaponize its program will be addressed. With this deal, Iran will face more inspections than any other country in the world. So, this will be a long-term deal that addresses each path to a potential Iranian nuclear bomb. There will be strict limits on Iran's program for a decade. Additional restrictions on building new facilities or stockpiling materials will last for 15 years. The unprecedented transparency measures will last for 20 years or more. Indeed, some will be permanent. And as a member of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, Iran will never be permitted to develop a nuclear weapon. In return for Iran's actions, the international community has agreed to provide Iran with relief from certain sanctions. Our own sanctions and international sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council. This relief will be phased, as Iran takes steps to adhere to the deal. If Iran violates the deal, sanctions can be snapped back into place. Meanwhile, other American sanctions on Iran for its support of terrorism, its human rights abuses, its ballistic missile program, will continue to be fully enforced. Now let me re-emphasize, our work is not yet done. The deal has not been signed. Between now and the end of June, the negotiators will continue to work through the details of how this framework will be fully implemented and those details matter. If there is backsliding on the part of the Iranians, if the verification and inspection mechanisms don't meet the specifications of our nuclear and security experts, there will be no deal. But if we can get this done and Iran follows through on the framework that our negotiators agreed to, we will be able to resolve one of the greatest threats to our security and to do so peacefully. Given the importance of this issue, I have instructed my negotiators to fully brief Congress and the American people on the substance the deal. And I welcome a robust debate in the weeks and months to come. I am confident that we can show that this deal is good for the security of the United States, for our allies and for the world. [ A step-by-step guide to what the deal actually means ] But the fact is we only have three options for addressing Iran's nuclear program. First, we can reach a robust and verifiable deal, like this one, and peacefully prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. The second option is we can bomb Iran's nuclear facilities, thereby starting another war in the Middle East and setting back Iran's program by a few years. In other words, setting it back by a fraction of the time that this deal will set it back. Meanwhile, we'd ensure that Iran would raise their head to try and build a bomb. Third, we could pull out of negotiations, try to get other countries to go along and continue sanctions that are currently in place or add additional ones and hope for the best. Knowing that every time we have done so, Iran has not capitulated, but instead has advanced its program. And that in very short order, the breakout timeline would be eliminated and a nuclear arms race in the region could be triggered because of that uncertainty. In other words, the third option leads us very quickly back to a decision about whether or not to take military action because we'd have no idea what was going on inside of Iran. Iran is not going to simply dismantle its program because we demand it to do so. That's not how the world works. And that's not what history shows us. Iran has shown no willingness to eliminate those aspects of their program that they maintain are for peaceful purposes, even in the face of unprecedented sanctions. Should negotiations collapse because we, the United States, rejected what the majority of the world considers a fair deal, what our scientists and nuclear experts suggest would give us confidence that they are not developing a nuclear weapon, it's doubtful that we could even keep our current international sanctions in place. So when you hear the inevitable critics of the deal sound off, ask them a simple question: Do you really think that this verifiable deal, if fully implemented, backed by the world's major powers, is a worse option than the risk of another war in the Middle East? Is it worse than doing what we've done for almost two decades with Iran moving forward with its nuclear program and without robust inspections? I think the answer will be clear. Remember, I have always insisted that I will do what is necessary to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, and I will. But I also know that a diplomatic solution is the best way to get this done and offers a more comprehensive and lasting solution. It is our best option by far. And while it is always a possibility that Iran may try to cheat on the deal in the future, this framework of inspections and transparency makes it far more likely that we'll know about it if they try to cheat, and I or future presidents will have preserved all of the options that are currently available to deal with it. To the Iranian people, I want to reaffirm what I've said since the beginning of my presidency. We are willing to engage you on the basis of mutual interests and mutual respect. This deal offers the prospect of relief from sanctions that were imposed because of Iran's violation of international law. Since Iran's supreme leader has issued a fatwa against the development of nuclear weapons, this framework gives Iran the opportunity to verify that it's program is, in fact, peaceful. It demonstrates that if Iran complies with its international obligations, then it can fully rejoin the community of nations, thereby fulfilling the extraordinary talent and aspirations of the Iranian people. That would be good for Iran, and it would be good for the world. Of course, this deal alone, even if fully implemented, will not end the deep divisions and mistrust between our two countries. We have a difficult history between us. And our concerns will remain with respect to Iranian behavior so long as Iran continues its sponsorship of terrorism, its support for proxies who destabilize the Middle East, its threats against America's friends and allies, like Israel. So make no mistake, we will remain vigilant in countering those actions and standing with our allies. It's no secret that the Israeli prime minister and I don't agree about whether the United States should move forward with a peaceful resolution to the Iranian issue. If in fact Prime Minister Netanyahu is looking for the most effective way to ensure Iran doesn't get a nuclear weapon, this is the best option. And I believe our nuclear experts can confirm that. More importantly, I will be speaking with the prime minister today to make clear that there will be no daylight, there is no daylight when it comes to our support for Israel's security and our concerns about Iran's destabilizing policies and threats towards Israel. That's why I've directed my national security team to consult closely with the new Israeli government in the coming weeks and months about how we can further strengthen our long-term security cooperation with Israel and make clear our unshakeable commitment to Israel's defense. Today, I also spoke with the king of Saudi Arabia, to reaffirm our commitment to the security of our partners in the Gulf. And I am inviting the leaders of the six countries who make up the Gulf Cooperation Council, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, and Bahrain to meet me at Camp David this spring to discuss how we can further strengthen our security cooperation while resolving the multiple conflicts that have caused so much hardship and instability throughout the Middle East. Finally, it's worth remembering that Congress has, on a bipartisan basis, played a critical role in our current Iran policy, helping to shape the sanctions regime that applied so much pressure on Iran and ultimately forced them to the table. In the coming days and weeks, my administration will engage Congress once again about how we can play -- how it can play a constructive oversight role. I'll begin that effort by speaking to the leaders of the House and the Senate today. In those conversations, I will underscore that the issues at stake here are bigger than politics. These are matters of war and peace. And they should be evaluated based on the facts, and what is ultimately best for the American people and for our national security. For, this is not simply a deal between my administration and Iran. This is a deal between Iran, the United States of America and the major powers in the world, including some of our closest allies. If Congress kills this deal not based on expert analysis, and without offering any reasonable alternative, then it's the United States that will be blamed for the failure of diplomacy. International unity will collapse, and the path to conflict will widen. The American people understand this, which is why a solid majority support a diplomatic resolution to the Iranian nuclear issue. They understand instinctively the words of President Kennedy, who faced down the far greater threat of Communism, and said, "Let us never negotiate out of fear, but let us never fear to negotiate." The American people remembered that at the height of the Cold War. Presidents like Nixon and Reagan struck historic arms control agreements with the Soviet Union, a far more dangerous adversary, despite the fact that that adversary not only threatened to destroy our country and our way of life, but had the means to do so. Those agreements were not perfect. They did not end all threats. But they made our world safer. A good deal with Iran will do the same. Today I'd like to express my thanks to our international partners for their steadfastness, their cooperation. I was able to speak earlier today with our close allies, Prime Minister Cameron and President Holland and Chancellor Merkel, to reaffirm that we stand shoulder-to-shoulder in this effort. And most of all, on behalf of our nation, I want to express my thanks to our tireless -- and I mean tireless -- Secretary of State John Kerry and our entire negotiating team. They have worked so hard to make this progress. They represent the best tradition of American diplomacy. Their work, our work, is not yet done and success is not guaranteed. But we have a historic opportunity to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons in Iran and to do so peacefully, with the international community firmly behind us. We should seize that chance. Thank you. God bless you. And god bless the United States of America.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/04/02/president-obamas-full-remarks-announcing-a-framework-for-a-nuclear-deal-with-iran/"
"The Iran Nuclear Deal: What You Need to Know","Advertisement Supported by By  The New York Times The nuclear accord announced by Iran, the United States and five other world powers on Thursday was surprisingly specific and placed limits on Tehran’s nuclear program for the next 15 years. Its central achievement was to reduce Iran’s existing stockpile of nuclear fuel and its capacity to produce new fuel to a level that would ensure it would take at least a year for Iran to manufacture enough fuel for an atomic weapon if it chose to violate the accord. It took two years of negotiations, capped by eight tumultuous days and nights of talks that appeared on the brink of breakdown several times. Negotiators produced a framework for a comprehensive agreement that parties say they intend to draft by June 30. If that final deal is reached and signed, it will be the most significant accord between Iran and major world powers since its Islamic revolution in 1979. • Is allowed to keep its nuclear facilities, which it insists are for civilian uses only, but they would be subject to strict production limits. Two facilities will be converted into research sites without fissile material. • Cuts the number of its centrifuges, which are used to enrich uranium, by two-thirds to 5,060, and reduces its stockpile of low-enriched uranium from 10,000 kilograms to 300 kilograms — not enough for a nuclear weapon — for 15 years. Thousands of centrifuges will be put into storage. A guide to help you navigate the deal between global powers and Tehran. • Agrees to redesign a heavy-water reactor at Arak in a way that would keep it from producing plutonium, a weapons-usable fuel. • Gets relief from a range of international sanctions that have sharply reduced its sale of oil and impeded access to the international financial system. Negotiations over research and development of more advanced centrifuges were particularly difficult. The Iranians won the right to research, but not to use more modern machines for production for the next 10 years. • The timing of sanctions relief. Iran wants all sanctions removed quickly. The United States says sanctions would be removed in stages after Iran shows compliance with the terms of a final nuclear agreement. • The Americans want all nuclear facilities “anywhere in the country,” including military bases, to be subject to inspections that could “investigate suspicious sites or allegations of a covert enrichment facility.” • The process for ensuring Iran remains in compliance with the terms of the agreement and the process for reimposing sanctions if its is found to fall out of compliance. • The details of how Iran’s existing stockpile of nuclear fuel would be diluted, neutralized or removed from the country. American officials say even if Iran breaks the deal, it would not be able to develop enough material for a nuclear weapon for a year, giving the international community time to respond. President Obama insisted that the deal “cuts off every pathway” for Iran to develop a nuclear weapon and establishes the most intrusive inspection system in history. “If Iran cheats,” he said, “the world will know it.” Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, who won the 2013 election promising to mend the country’s ties with the rest of the world , said on Twitter that he had congratulated his foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, and the rest of the negotiating team for their “tireless efforts around the clock.” There was no immediate reaction from Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who in recent weeks has emphasized that all Iranians should support the negotiations. There was huge demand within Iran for an end to Western sanctions on the oil and banking sectors. There were celebrations on the streets in some parts of Tehran on Thursday night. But Iranian negotiators will have to overcome significant political objections from hard-liners, the military and scientific establishments. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, the world’s most vocal critic of the emerging agreement, demanded on Friday that Iran recognize his country’s right to exist as part of a deal. He continues to argue that a deal poses a grave danger to the region and the world. Many leaders in Arab countries also oppose the deal, which comes amid tensions over Iran’s involvement in Yemen, Syria, Iraq and Lebanon. Mr. Obama called King Salman of Saudi Arabia on Friday to reassure the United States’ longtime ally that he remains concerned about “Iran’s destabilizing activities in the region,” and invited the king and other Gulf leaders to Camp David in the spring. Mr. Obama will have a hard time convincing a skeptical Congress, where Republicans and many Democrats are deeply concerned that he has grown so desperate to reach a deal that he is trading away American and Israeli security. He warned Republicans in Congress that if they tried to impose new sanctions to undermine the effort, the United States would be blamed for a diplomatic failure. But if a final agreement is reached, it could reorder America’s relationship with a country that has been an avowed adversary for 36 years, and would define the president’s foreign policy legacy.

"Iran nuclear deal: negotiators announce 'framework' agreement","EU foreign policy chief and Iranian foreign minister hail ‘decisive step’ in Switzerland after 18 months of intensive bargaining  Julian Borger in Lausanne and  Paul Lewis in Washington  Thu 2 Apr 2015 19.46 EDT   First published on Thu 2 Apr 2015 14.37 EDT   Iran has promised to make drastic cuts to its nuclear programme in return for the gradual lifting of sanctions as part of a historic breakthrough in Lausanne that could end a 13-year nuclear standoff. The “political understanding”, announced on Thursday night in the Swiss city’s technical university, followed 18 months of intensive bargaining, culminating in an eight-day period of near-continuous talks that went on long into the night, and on the last night continued all the way through until dawn. In a joint statement, the European Union’s foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, and the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, hailed what they called a “decisive step” after more than a decade of work. Speaking afterwards, Zarif said the accord showed “our programme is exclusively peaceful, has always been and always will remain exclusively peaceful”, while not hindering the country’s pursuit of atomic energy for civilian purposes. Speaking at the White House, Barack Obama said that if fully implemented, the agreement would “cut off every pathway that Iran could take to develop a nuclear weapon”. As news of the deal reached Tehran, people took to the streets to celebrate, looking forward to the prospect of life without sanctions. In Washington, meanwhile, there was a clear sign of the battle to come over the agreement, which Republicans have vowed to overturn. Senator Mark Kirk, who is promoting fresh sanctions against Iran, declared that former British prime minister Neville Chamberlain “got a better deal from Adolf Hitler” at Munich. In his remarks in Lausanne, Kerry issued a riposte to rightwing critics of the accord. “Throughout history, diplomacy has been necessary to prevent wars and to define international boundaries, to design institutions, and to develop global norms,” Kerry said. “Simply demanding that Iran capitulate makes a nice soundbite, but it’s not a policy. It is not a realistic plan ... The test is whether or not it will leave the world safer or more secure than it would be without this agreement. And there can be no question that the comprehensive plan that we are moving toward will more than pass that test.” The US president is expected to face intense opposition on Capitol Hill, particularly from Republicans, who are determined to use their control of both chambers of the legislature to undermine an agreement they believe is soft on Tehran. Obama acknowledged there would be “a robust debate in the weeks and months to come” but insisted the agreement was both the most peaceful and effective method to ensure Iran does not obtain a nuclear weapon. “If we can get this done, and Iran follows through on the framework that our negotiators agreed to, we will be able to resolve one of the greatest threats to our security, and to do so peacefully.” The declaration of a framework deal is both preliminary and partial. It does not cover all the issues in dispute and is intended to be only a precursor to a full, comprehensive and detailed agreement due to be completed by the end of June. Before then, the understanding must survive attack from hardliners in Iran and the US. But the joint statement and the details published in Lausanne represent a set of basic compromises that had eluded negotiators for many years. Iran will cut its nuclear infrastructure to the point that western governments are satisfied it would take a year to “breakout” and build a bomb, if Tehran chose to follow that path. At the same time, Iran will open itself up to a level of monitoring and scrutiny of its nuclear programme that is likely to unparalleled anywhere in the world. When all that has been achieved, which could be in as little as six months, the overwhelming bulk of international sanctions would be lifted and Iran would re-enter the global economy. The accord also has the potential to be a turning point in normalising Iran’s adversarial relations with the west, which have been a constant in world affairs since the Islamic revolution of 1979. “This could be one of the most important diplomatic achievements in a generation or more,” said Ali Vaez, an Iran analyst at the International Crisis Group. The UK foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, said: “This is well beyond what many of us thought possible even 18 months ago.” Hammond said that Iran would face stringent monitoring of its programme. “There is a very rigorous transparency and inspection regime with access for international inspectors on a daily basis, high-tech surveillance of all the facilities, TV cameras, electronic seals on equipment, so we know remotely if any equipment has been moved,” he said. But Israel dismissed the deal, and said it would continue to prevent a “bad” final agreement. Strategic affairs minister Yuval Steinitz said in a statement after the announcements in Switzerland: “The smiles in Lausanne are detached from wretched reality in which Iran refuses to make any concessions on the nuclear issue and continues to threaten Israel and all other countries in the Middle East.” Obama spoke to Israel’s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, who told him that a final deal based on the agreement “would threaten the survival of Israel”. Among the main points of the understanding unveiled in Lausanne are: The first major test of the understanding will come in the next few days, when Kerry is expected to present the details to a closed session of the Senate foreign relations committee before a vote on a bill that would give Congress the power to accept or reject any nuclear agreement and another that would impose new sanctions. Zarif, Kerry’s opposite number at the talks, is expected to return to Tehran to a hero’s welcome from a public desperate to escape the shackles of sanctions, but he has frequently warned his fellow negotiators that he will face a backlash from hardliners opposed to dismantling any of Iran’s prized nuclear infrastructure. Kazem Sadjadpour, an Iranian university professor, said on state TV: “I feel very proud as an Iranian … This is a turning point in Iran’s history of diplomacy. This is a night of mourning for Netanyahu and his warmongering allies in the US congress.” The nuclear standoff with Iran has been a threat to global security and non-proliferation for well over a decade since a uranium enrichment plant at Natanz and a heavy water production plant at Arak were exposed in 2002 by an opposition group, probably using Israeli intelligence. Negotiations began in 2003 with European states in which Iran offered to limit its capacity to 3,000 centrifuges if its right to enrichment was recognised. The deal collapsed by 2005 and there was no sign of compromise for the next eight years, as the international community ratcheted up sanctions and Iran responded defiantly by expanding its nuclear programme, moving from production of low-enriched uranium to 20%-enriched uranium, a major step towards the capacity to make weapons-grade fissile material. The confrontation continued to escalate until 2013 and the election of a pragmatist president in Iran, Hassan Rouhani, who acted swiftly to establish lines of communication with the White House and between Kerry and Zarif. An interim deal was agreed in November 2013 that halted production of 20%-enriched uranium and eliminated Iran’s stockpile of the material in return for access to $700m a month of its assets frozen around the world. The interim deal, known as the joint plan of action, bought time for a comprehensive agreement which was initially intended to be completed by July last year. The negotiators gave themselves another four months until November, and then after marathon talks in Vienna, it was postponed again, setting 30 June as the new deadline.","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/02/iran-nuclear-deal-negotiators-announce-framework-agreement"
"Iran, major powers labor to keep nuclear deal afloat","EURACTIV with Reuters  EU-director Helga Schmid (L-R), Federica Mogherini, EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Foreign Minister of Iran Mohammad Javad Zarif and Deputy-Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi attend a ministerial meeting of the Joint Commission at the Palais Coburg, in Vienna on06 July 2018. [ EPA-EFE/CHRISTIAN BRUNA ] Comments  Print    The remaining parties to the Iran nuclear deal agreed on Monday (24 September) to keep working to maintain trade with Tehran despite scepticism this is possible as U.S. sanctions to choke off Iranian oil sales resume in November. US President Donald Trump decided in May to abandon the pact and to restore economic sanctions on Iran, including those that seek to force the OPEC member’s major oil customers to stop buying Iranian crude. In a statement after a meeting of Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and Iran, the group said they were determined to develop payment mechanisms to continue trade with Iran despite skepticism by many diplomats that this will be possible. “Mindful of the urgency and the need for tangible results, the participants welcomed practical proposals to maintain and develop payment channels notably the initiative to establish a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) to facilitate payments related to Iran’s exports, including oil,” the group said in a joint statement issued after the statement. Several European diplomats said the SPV idea was to create a barter system, similar to one used by the Soviet Union during the Cold War, to exchange Iranian oil for European goods without money changing hands. The idea is to circumvent U.S. sanctions due to be restored in November under which Washington can cut off from the U.S. financial system any bank that facilitates an oil transaction with Iran. Speaking to reporters after the meeting, European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said the decision to set up such a vehicle had already been taken and that technical experts would meet again to flesh out the details. “In practical terms this will mean that EU member states will set up a legal entity to facilitate legitimate financial transactions with Iran and this will allow European companies to continue to trade with Iran in accordance with European Union law and could be open to other partners in the world,” she said. "Engaging is not being soft," says @FedericaMog in defending the Iran nuclear deal. "Is it war, the alternative?" pic.twitter.com/yFXQ1yeM50 — Christiane Amanpour (@camanpour) September 25, 2018 Many diplomats and analysts, however, are skeptical such a vehicle could ultimately thwart U.S. sanctions given that the United States could amend its sanctions laws to prohibit such barter transactions. “The key is to keep all possibilities open so that we can signal to the Iranians that the door isn’t closing,” said a senior French diplomat. The European Union has so far failed to devise a workable legal framework to shield its companies from U.S. sanctions that go into effect in November and that, among other things, seek to choke off Iran’s oil sales, diplomats said. The European Commission approved an €18 million support package to Iran on Thursday (23 August) sending an important signal both to Teheran and Washington that Brussels will not back on its efforts to preserve the nuclear deal despite US sanctions. Highlighting how difficult it will be for the Europeans to come up with concrete solutions, French state-owned bank Bpifrance on Monday abandoned a plan to set up a financial mechanism to aid French firms trading with Iran. The crux of the 2015 nuclear deal, negotiated over almost two years by the administration of former U.S. President Barack Obama, was that Iran would restrain its nuclear program in return for the relaxation of sanctions that had crippled its economy. Trump considered it flawed because it did not include curbs on Iran’s ballistic missiles program or its support for proxies in Syria, Yemen, Lebanon and Iraq. The impending return of U.S. sanctions has contributed to a slide in Iran’s currency. The rial has lost about two-thirds of its value this year, hitting a record low against the U.S. dollar this month. Comments  Print    Efficacité et Transparence des Acteurs Européens 1999-2018.

"The historic nuclear deal with Iran: How it works","After more than two weeks of wrangling and missed deadlines in Vienna, Iran and its international interlocutors have finally clinched a historic accord over Tehran's nuclear program . The diplomacy with Iran, an endeavor that faced vociferous opposition throughout , was aimed at curbing the Islamic republic's ability to produce a nuclear weapon. A tentative framework was inked in April between Iran and its negotiating partners, which include the United States, Russia, Britain, France, China and Germany. [ Why it was so difficult to reach a deal. ] The deal's proponents argue that the talks have yielded the best guarantee possible that Iran won't be able to move toward nuclear weapons, while also, for the time being, reducing the risk of yet another military escalation in the Middle East. "This deal offers an opportunity to move in a new direction. We should seize it," President Obama said Tuesday. Here's a guide to how it works. The main benchmark by which analysts gauge Iran's ability to produce an atomic bomb is the "breakout" time — the time needed for Iran to produce enough weapons-grade enriched uranium for one nuclear bomb. It is currently estimated at a couple of months; under the terms of the deal, that time frame has been extended to at least one year. The implication here is key: One year gives world powers enough time to mobilize action to interrupt Iran's pathway to a bomb. The extended breakout time also presents, in its own right, a strategic obstacle to Iran's leadership, raising the stakes if it ever considered rushing toward building a nuclear arsenal. To be sure, Tehran has always insisted that it has no interest in obtaining a nuclear weapon, but its covert activities in the past raised the world's suspicions and led to tough international trade, banking and financial sanctions. [ Full text of the Iran nuclear deal ] The deal focuses on limiting Iran's ability to produce and maintain the fissile material needed to build nuclear weapons. Along the lines of the April framework agreement, Iran will cut its number of centrifuges — the devices used to enrich uranium gas — from 19,000 to 6,000. Its stockpile of enriched uranium will be reduced from about 10,000 kilograms to 300. The heavy-water reactor at Arak will be reengineered so that it does not yield material that can be turned into weapons-grade plutonium, and all of its spent fuel is to be shipped out of Iran for the life of the reactor. Iran has committed to not building a similar reactor for the next 15 years. Uranium enrichment at the underground facility in Fordow — a concern because some outside observers believe it would be difficult to hit with an airstrike — will be strictly curbed. Iran will be prevented from bringing fissile material into the site over the next 15 years; Fordow will lose more than half of its 2,800 centrifuges and be converted into a nuclear physics research center. In all these instances, the deal outlines tight guidelines for monitoring and verification by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N. nuclear watchdog. IAEA inspectors will be granted regular access to all these major nuclear sites and will monitor Iran's nuclear infrastructure, from its uranium mills to centrifuge storage facilities, for up to 25 years. The Israeli newspaper Haaretz unpacks how access will be guaranteed at Iran's most sensitive sites: According to the agreement, UN inspectors will be able to enter any suspect facility in Iran within a maximum period of 24 days. Iran will be able to present reservations to the IAEA's requests to visit suspicious facilities. In such cases, a special arbitration committee will be established to make a decision. The committee will include representatives of the six world powers, Iran and the European Union. Iran will be in the minority, with only Russia and China holding positions close to Tehran's. The deal, in the next week to 10 days, will be sent to the U.N. Security Council — Iran's negotiating partners included all five permanent members of the Security Council, plus Germany. There, it will be codified by a new resolution once the IAEA certifies that Iran has stuck to its commitments regarding its enrichment capabilities. This will lead to the Security Council dropping its wide-reaching sanctions on the Iranian regime, which have crippled the country's economy. If Iran violates any terms of the deal, sanctions could be snapped back within 65 days. Separately, a U.N. embargo on conventional weapons sales will be lifted within five years, while a ban on missile sales to Iran will be lifted within eight years. In the last few heated days of talks, this particular element of the dispute appeared to be the most intractable, with Russia pushing aggressively for an end to the arms embargo, but it appears both sides have met halfway. Oil prices have already dropped at the prospect of Iran's huge petroleum industry returning to the fold. Critics of the deal, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Republican hawks in Washington, warn that, contrary to the Obama administration's talking points, it gives Iran a ticket to becoming a nuclear superpower. These claims are somewhat undermined by the many tough provisions within the deal. For opponents, though, the issue lies less in the technical details and mechanisms negotiated in Vienna and more in Iran's track record in the region. Since 1979, the Islamic republic has been an avowed enemy of the United States and its interests, and has supported proxy militias across the Middle East, including some groups deemed terrorist organizations. The Obama administration has been clear that the goal of the negotiations was to place ironclad controls on Iran's nuclear program, not fundamentally change the Iranian regime's outlook or policy. "Tough talk from Washington does not solve problems," Obama said. "Hard-nosed diplomacy, leadership that has united the world's major powers offers a more effective way to verify that Iran is not pursuing a nuclear weapon."","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/07/14/the-historic-nuclear-deal-with-iran-how-it-works/"
"6 Things You Should Know About The Iran Nuclear Deal","Eyder Peralta  A satellite image shows the Fordow facility in Iran. Under an agreement with six world powers, Iran would stop enriching uranium at the facility. DigitalGlobe/Getty Images  hide caption  A satellite image shows the Fordow facility in Iran. Under an agreement with six world powers, Iran would stop enriching uranium at the facility. Iran, the United States and five other world powers have reached a landmark agreement about the future of Iran's nuclear programs. The agreement that emerged after years of diplomacy and a final, marathon negotiating session by top diplomats over the past three weeks in Vienna is complex and highly technical. We've been studying the 100-page-plus agreement , and we've pulled out six tidbits that will help you understand the deal: 1. It Would Curb Iran's Nuclear Programs: As President Obama put it in a speech to the nation, the highlight of this deal is that it aims to stop Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. In practical terms, it puts limits on many of Iran's nuclear programs. For example: -- Iran has agreed to turn its Fordow facility into a research center where Iranian and world scientists will work side by side. Fordow, if you remember, has been at the center of international worry, because for years, experts have believed that Iran was enriching uranium in centrifuges there. Another worry: The facility is located underground, which would make it less vulnerable to a military strike. -- Under the deal, Iran has also agreed to rebuild its Arak heavy-water reactor, which is currently the only site in Iran capable of starting production on weapons-grade plutonium. Under the deal, the site would be rebuilt using a design approved by the international community. The design's point would be to make the production of weapons-grade plutonium impossible. -- The agreement also calls for Iran to give up most of its centrifuges. Under the deal, Iran would go from having 20,000 centrifuges, which are used to enrich uranium, to having 6,104 for the next 10 years. Under the deal, Iran also agrees to give up its most advanced centrifuges and use only their oldest models. 2. But It Still Allows Iran To Continue Enrichment : This part of the deal could be seen as a big win for Iran. The country has always maintained that its nuclear program is being used for peaceful purposes and it has always wanted the international community to acknowledge its right to enrich uranium and use it for those purposes. The deal allows Iran to continue doing just that at its Natanz facility, but the country would only be allowed to enrich uranium to no more than 3.67 percent, which is enough for civilian purposes such as power plants but is much lower than what's needed for a weapon. Another big part of the deal is that Iran has agreed to reduce its stockpile of uranium by 98 percent. As one U.S. administration official, who was briefing reporters on background, put it, Iran currently has 10,000 kg of enriched uranium. The country also has some additional uranium that is enriched at 20 percent. Under this deal, Iran could keep 300 kg — enriched at no more than 3.67 percent — for the next 15 years. More than likely, Iran will get rid of what it couldn't keep by shipping it to Russia. The bottom line: If it honors the deal, Iran would not have the kind of fissile material it needs for a nuclear bomb, but at the same time it does receive a nod from the international community that it can indeed keep a non-military nuclear program going. 3. The U.S. Says The Deal Makes An Iranian Nuclear Bomb More Difficult: Critics of the deal — House Speaker John Boehner and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu among them — believe that this is a bad deal because it doesn't entirely dismantle Iran's nuclear program. In a speech to the nation, President Obama said that while that is true, this deal extends Iran's "breakout time" — or the time it would take the country to make enough highly enriched material for a nuclear bomb. The White House estimates that at the moment, Iran's breakout time is two to three months. The White House estimates that if the deal were implemented and Iran were to someday walk away from it, the breakout time would be a year or more. Perhaps the biggest unknown is what happens to that breakout time once some of the terms of this deal start to expire 10 and 15 years from now. In an interview with NPR after the framework of this agreement was reached, President Obama conceded that "at that point the breakout times would have shrunk almost down to zero." But this deal, Obama argued at the time, buys the United States at least a decade. Ten or 15 years from now, Obama added, "we have much better ideas about what it is that their program involves. We have much more insight into their capabilities. And the option of a future president to take action if in fact they try to obtain a nuclear weapon is undiminished." 4. If Iran Doesn't Comply, Sanctions Can Return: The diplomats have been dancing around the language of this part of the deal. The Obama administration, for example, has said this deal includes a "snap back" provision, which means United Nations' sanctions — the most punishing of the bunch — would be slapped back on Iran if it doesn't meet its obligations. But just hours after the deal was announced, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani tweeted : "Upon #IranDeal implementation all sanctions will be lifted--not suspended. Otherwise,there was no need for 18-day round-the-clock #IranTalks " So, which is it? It's semantics. Turns out they are both right. The deal lays out a scheme in which if there is a dispute about Iran meeting its obligations, the full U.N. Security Council would "vote on a resolution to continue the sanctions lifting." That's what the U.S. calls a snap back and what Iran calls lifted — not suspended — sanctions. 5. It Sets Up A Comprehensive Inspections Regime : This is a big part of this deal. According to a White House fact sheet , the deal would give inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency "extraordinary and robust" access to Iranian facilities. Obama says this would give inspectors access 24/7. Another administration official briefing reporters on background described the agreement as "a forever commitment to providing enhanced transparency." Here's how the White House fact sheet describes the inspections: "[The IAEA] will not only be continuously monitoring every element of Iran's declared nuclear program, but they will also be verifying that no fissile material is covertly carted off to a secret location to build a bomb. And if IAEA inspectors become aware of a suspicious location, Iran has agreed to implement the Additional Protocol to their IAEA Safeguards Agreement, which will allow inspectors to access and inspect any site they deem suspicious. Such suspicions can be triggered by holes in the ground that could be uranium mines, intelligence reports, unexplained purchases, or isotope alarms." 6. Congress Has To Approve The Deal: Finally, the deal has to be approved by the U.S. Congress. Like most things in Washington, this is setting up to be contentious. House Speaker Boehner has already issued a statement saying he will "fight a bad deal that is wrong for our national security and wrong for our country." But, as The New York Times reports , Obama may ultimately come out victorious because of the law governing this particular deal. The paper reports: "Under the terms of legislation passed in May, Congress has 60 days to scrutinize the accord between Iran and the United States, Britain, France, China, Russia and Germany, and then to vote to accept or reject it — or to do nothing. The president can veto any resolution of disapproval. Congress needs a two-thirds majority in each house to override the veto, so to put the deal into force, Mr. Obama only needs one-third of one of the houses to stand with him."

"Was the Iran Deal Worth It?","Obama has secured an admirable agreement, but at tremendous cost.  I’ve long wanted to support a deal with Iran. Now that an agreement has been struck, I do. But I do so with major reservations. I can’t help feeling that the United States has paid a tremendous cost for what can only be described as a narrow—if understandable—focus on the minutia of Iran’s nuclear program, including extremely technical questions about, for example, centrifuges. I’ve found it hard to relate to this sort of discussion, because I’ve never quite seen Iran’s nuclear capability as the issue. Iran’s nuclear program mattered of course, but it mattered more because of the kind of regional actor Iran happened to be (if Iran was a U.S. ally and a democracy, we’d be having a different conversation). America’s Gulf allies, for all their faults, recognized this. What worried them most was Iran’s destabilizing role in the region. And while they exaggerated Iran’s meddling, while conveniently eliding their own, they were right to view Iran as a fundamentally negative force in places like Syria and Lebanon. The Obama administration repeatedly underscored that the negotiations weren’t about Iran’s other activities in the region: They were about the nuclear program. This, I gathered, was intended to reassure , but its effect was the opposite. Sure, any Iran deal depended on “dissociating” the nuclear issue from everything else, but the problem was that everything else mattered a whole lot, and perhaps just as much. To the extent that a successful deal—and keeping the Europeans on board—depended on “siloing” issues, the drawbacks of a deal were built into the process. These starting assumptions did not start with Barack Obama, but with George W. Bush , a fact all too often ignored. Administrations can, of course, “ walk and chew gum at the same time ,” but that neglects the interrelated nature of Middle East conflicts. The boutique case-by-case approach to the region that Obama has championed sounds smart and nuanced in theory—a welcome respite from Bush’s self-consciously grandiose frameworks—but if the Arab Spring underscored anything, it’s that politics are rarely only local. In nearly every major crisis and conflict—whether in Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Libya, Egypt, Lebanon, or Bahrain—external actors with regional ambitions have played an outsized, even decisive role. It’s difficult to believe in the durability of Egyptian authoritarianism without understanding how Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates view the Muslim Brotherhood as a transnational and not just a local threat. In Iraq, Iran seems like a potential (or actual) partner in the war on ISIS, until you realize that Iran is the determined patron of the Syrian regime, whose brutality has fueled ISIS’s rise to prominence. Meanwhile, the Obama administration’s “Iraq-first” strategy against ISIS seems reasonable, until you realize that America’s opponents treat Iraq and Syria as a combined theater, and that the fact that the United States doesn’t puts it at a profound disadvantage. In short, the belief that the U.S. government can “silo” the Iranian nuclear issue, or even Iran, suggests a detachment from the region’s realities as they’re actually lived. It is fairly easy to actually walk and chew gum at the same time. Doing one doesn’t affect the other, which makes it an inapt metaphor for policymaking. The Obama administration’s decision to focus on Iran’s nuclear program and, to a lesser extent, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict meant that U.S. officials could, and would, do less of other things, and do them less well. Political capital and bandwidth are finite resources. Policymaking is about deciding what to prioritize, particularly when the president and a small coterie of close advisors are pulled in a seemingly endless number of competing directions. When it comes to allies—especially ones that become nervous rather quickly and act rashly when nervous—you can afford to alienate them, but only up to a point. So you pick your battles. Obama administration officials wanted the Saudis to limit their public criticism of the Iran talks and go along with them, however grudgingly. These officials knew this was asking a lot, which made it difficult to make other big asks on, say, putting pressure on the Sisi regime in Egypt to be even just a tiny bit less repressive. It is perhaps in Yemen where the most damage has been done. (And this isn’t just about the country’s civil war. Beginning in 2011, the United States outsourced its Yemen policy to Saudi Arabia, which didn’t work so well. To correct this, the U.S. outsourced its Yemen policy to Saudi Arabia. ) It’s no secret that America’s Gulf allies feel the U.S. hasn’t done nearly enough to counter Iran’s ambitions in the region. (The fact that Obama seems to hold out hope that a deal could help rehabilitate Iran both regionally and internationally doesn’t help matters.) Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries opted to launch a destructive intervention in Yemen, at tremendous human  cost , in part because of fears of U.S. disengagement and nervousness over U.S. policy toward Iran. As Ken Pollack recently testified to Congress: “In private, [Gulf Cooperation Council] officials make no bones in saying that they felt compelled to [intervene in Yemen] because the United States was embracing Iran rather than deterring or defeating it.” U.S. officials, despite having major qualms about the intervention, had little interest in picking a fight with Saudi Arabia over Yemen, when they were already expending their political capital to reassure the Saudis about the Iran negotiations. Then there’s Syria. It was clear from the start of that country’s uprising that Obama did, in fact, have a clear objective: minimizing U.S. involvement as much as possible. But there are other places, such as Iraq, where the Obama administration was pulled back despite (or, more likely, because of) its best efforts. The administration’s unwillingness to rethink its Syria strategy in any serious way was reinforced by the momentum of the Iran negotiations. Why potentially provoke a major international incident when progress was being made on Iran’s nuclear program? Why even take the chance with so much at stake? “Linkage,” moreover, was built into the policy process. As the journalist Josh Rogin noted , “All Syria proposals at State must go through the office of the undersecretary for political affairs, Wendy Sherman, who is also the administration’s lead negotiator over a nuclear deal with Iran.” On the specifics of the deal, I tend to think, like many, that the U.S. made too many concessions without getting enough in return. According to The New York Times , in the final days of talks, a television anchor on a hardline Iranian channel said , “The fact is, Obama needs this deal much more than we do.” She went on: “The American president needs a victory, and only a deal with Iran can give him that. They have retreated on several issues and compromised on their own red lines.” Whether or not this perception is fair, it’s a perception nonetheless, and perceptions drive behavior. Others have noted that Iran, due to its deteriorating economy, needed a deal more than the United States did. This is almost certainly true. But while Iran may have needed it more, the U.S. wanted it more—or, at the very least, seemed like it did. Some of this, to be fair, was outside America’s control. Well before the talks concluded, a perception had already solidified throughout the region based on six years of observing the Obama administration’s handling of various crises, most notably its backing down from stated “red lines” in Syria. Allies, such as Egypt, and enemies, such as Syria, have grown confident that the United States will blink first in a staring contest, in part because the U.S. usually does. The administration has had a tendency to misuse and/or underestimate its leverage in some of its most important bilateral relationships. There was a related asymmetry during the negotiations. As Pollack writes , “I don’t think that Iran values a nuclear deal as much as it does its positions in these various countries.” With the United States, it was the reverse: The Obama administration cared less about Iran’s positions in various countries and more about its nuclear program. This, too, was built into the talks. Some are troubled that most people had strong opinions about the deal before reading the actual text of the agreement. One certainly hopes that legislators will eventually read at least some of it. But the specifics of the deal aren’t, ultimately, as important as the broader issues and implications, and those aren’t anywhere to be found in the text. Here, I tend to agree with my colleague Jeremy Shapiro who argued in April that that the devil wasn’t in the details. The details “really don’t matter.” He goes on: “At heart, this is a fight over what to do about Iran’s challenge to U.S. leadership in the Middle East and the threat that Iranian geopolitical ambitions pose to U.S. allies.” In other words, your position on the Iran deal is likely to depend on how you view the Middle East and America’s role in it more broadly. If you see the Syrian civil war as a, or even the , core regional conflict, then you’re probably worried about the $100 billion in potential sanctions relief for Iran. Even if we assume that Iran chooses butter over guns (as U.S. officials hope) and uses, say, only 3 percent of that total, it will have $3 billion more to prop up the Syrian regime and other regional allies and proxies. Your interpretation of the agreement also depends on your starting assumptions about the nature of the Iranian regime. Are Iranian leaders “rational,” and do you think it matters whether “moderates,” such as President Hassan Rouhani and Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, are empowered over their “hardline” counterparts? One other factor has pushed me to be more supportive of the Iran deal than I expected to be. It’s striking how little discussion there has been about what Iranians think and want. As small-d democrats, Americans should always at least take into account public opinion in other countries. Presumably, Iranians know their country better than American politicians do. According to opinion polls, a majority of Iranians favor a deal. Many of us saw the pictures of ordinary Iranians celebrating the framework agreement in April. This time around, the regime has been more careful, closing off public spaces, with hardliners warning of the dangers of Iran deal-induced “happiness.” Importantly, as Nader Hashemi notes , “some of the most vociferous defenders of a nuclear deal with the West are Iranian civil society and human rights activists.” It makes little sense for Americans to say that an Iran deal will make progress on human rights in the Islamic Republic less likely, when Iran’s own human-rights activists seem to think the opposite. In a 2014 survey of 22 leading human-rights activists , support for ongoing negotiations was “unanimous,” while over half believed that a deal would lead to a significant improvement in human rights in Iran. Of course, they could be wrong, but it’s unwise to bet on that. The link between a deal and the empowerment of Iranian reformers, as intuitive as it might seem, is far from guaranteed. As many have noted , conservatives may be just as likely to gain from a deal for any number of reasons. What seems inescapable, however, is that the failure of negotiations would have been a major—perhaps even decisive—loss for Iran’s reformist trend. President Rouhani, who buoyed expectations with his come-from-behind election victory two years ago, and pledged to expand personal freedoms while broadening space for civil society, has been losing popularity and goodwill . The economy can sputter along as it has been, but without sanctions relief Rouhani’s hands are tied. His raison d’etre, then, depends on a successful deal. A failed deal would likely bring more of the same: conservatives in control and dominating the country’s politics. Now, at least, the possibility of a different direction exists, even if many obstacles to substantive reforms remain. Taking these various, and very different, factors into account, the deal is, on balance, “good,” but only if we read the agreement in a vacuum. I don’t think an Iran nuclear deal deserved the near-obsessive focus it received from this administration. Too much was subsumed and compromised due to the desire for a deal, an administration priority that took precedence over nearly everything else. Now that a deal has been concluded, U.S. officials may have more room to maneuver. The implementation of the deal will still require constant attention from the Obama administration, to say nothing of the domestic political fight that is still to come. But perhaps, at some point, the U.S. government will be able to act and think beyond Iran’s nuclear program and refocus attention on the broader issues and conflicts in which Iran plays a major role. The United States will now come under pressure to “compensate” (or overcompensate, depending on your perspective) for the nuclear accord. It will need to reassure skeptical Gulf allies that it will do more to counter Iran’s regional designs. I agree with Ken Pollack that the best place to do this is probably in Syria. As he writes , “In the aftermath of an Iranian nuclear deal, finally executing the Administration’s proclaimed strategy for Syria, may be the best and only way to regain control over the dangerous confrontation escalating between Iran and America’s Arab allies.” Now that Obama’s legacy, however controversial, is secure (both on domestic and foreign policy), he can afford to do the very things he wasn’t willing to do when Iran negotiations were his overwhelming focus. That doesn’t mean he will do them, but that’s where, I hope, the debate over a post-Iran deal Middle East can now turn. We want to hear what you think about this article.

"Iran nuclear deal: world powers reach historic agreement to lift sanctions","Obama vows to veto any Republican attempt to undermine deal as Iran hails ‘win-win solution’  Julian Borger in Vienna  Tue 14 Jul 2015 08.54 EDT   First published on Tue 14 Jul 2015 07.00 EDT   Iran and six world powers have concluded an agreement that will lift sanctions on Iran but place strict limits on its nuclear programme for more than a decade, in a historic compromise designed to stop the spread of atomic weapons and avert a major new conflict in the Middle East. The deal, concluded in a Vienna hotel after prolonged talks between foreign ministers, binds Iran, the US, UK, France, Germany, Russia and China to a series of undertakings stretching over many years. Iran will dismantle much of its nuclear infrastructure, while the UN, US and EU will take down a wall of sanctions built around Iran over the past nine years. Barack Obama said the agreement was the best available option to prevent Tehran from acquiring a nuclear bomb, and promised to veto any attempt by Republican opponents to undermine it . His Iranian counterpart, Hassan Rouhani, said a new phase had begun in Iran’s relations with the rest of the world. Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Washington-based Arms Control Association, described the agreement as among the most complex and consequential of the nuclear age: “[The agreement follows] nearly two years of intense negotiations involving seven nations, including two long-time adversaries, after more than a decade of false starts and missed opportunities. “The deal is a major nuclear nonproliferation breakthrough that promises to prevent the emergence of another nuclear-armed state and head off a nuclear arms race in the world’s most volatile region.” Among the conditions of the agreement are: Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, who has been leading his country’s delegation in Vienna, described the agreement as a “win-win” solution but not perfect. “I believe this is a historic moment,” he said. “We are reaching an agreement that is not perfect for anybody but is what we could accomplish. Today could have been the end of hope, but now we are starting a new chapter of hope.” Federica Mogherini, the EU’s foreign policy chief, said the agreement would “open the way to a new chapter in international relations” and show that diplomacy can overcome decades of tension. “This is a sign of hope for the entire world,” she said. Israel’s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, who has faced mounting criticism at home over his handling of the diplomacy around Iran, moved pre-emptively to denounce the deal even before the details had emerged. Heading a chorus of condemnation from Israeli politicians – including many members of his rightwing coalition – he said the agreement was a capitulation and a mistake of historic proportions. The deal was also denounced by the hardline former foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman as “a total surrender to terror”. Yair Lapid, head of the Yesh Atid party, said Netanyahu’s campaign over Iran had been a “colossal failure”. Later this month, the UN security council will pass a resolution incorporating the agreement and its five annexes as an attachment, but it will be 90 days before it enters into force, to allow for it to be reviewed domestically in the US and Iran. At that point, Iran will carry out its part of the bargain, dismantling nuclear infrastructure. Western officials say that might take several months, but a senior Iranian official said his government was ready to act much faster. “We think that in a matter of weeks not months we will be able to finish what we have committed to,” the official said. A trial by fire under the highly sceptical scrutiny of the US Congress will be the biggest challenge to the deal’s survival. The deal will enter a period of limbo for up to 82 days: 60 for Congress to review it and a further 22 for a first vote and possibly a second in the event of a presidential veto. On Tuesday Obama promised to use his veto on any domestic attempts to undermine the deal. “I am confident that this deal will meet the national security needs of the United States and our allies, so I will veto any legislation that prevents the successful implementation of this deal,” he said. “We do not have to accept an inevitable spiral into conflict, and we certainly shouldn’t seek it.” The president said the agreement was not based on trust with Tehran, which he acknowledged is a longtime enemy of the United States, but rather “built on verification”. He added: “This deal meets every single one of the bottom lines we established when we achieved a framework earlier this spring. Every pathway to a nuclear weapon is cut off. And the inspection and transparency regime necessary to verify that objective will be put in place.” Iran’s Majlis will also take time to debate the deal, but without a fixed timetable. Only if and when the agreement survives both processes will it start to be implemented. Iran will start dismantling centrifuges, shipping out or converting its stockpile of low enriched uranium (LEU), removing the core from its heavy water reactor in Arak and start intensive work with the International Atomic Energy Agency on resolving unanswered questions about possible past work on nuclear weapons design. At the same time, Obama will issue presidential waivers suspending US economic and financial sanctions, and the EU will vote to lift its oil embargo and banking sanctions. The UN resolution would lift six layers of international sanctions, except for an arms embargo and restrictions on missile technology. None of the sanctions relief measures will take immediate effect, but will be conditional on the IAEA verifying that Iran has carried out all its promised steps. The aim is to have this done by the end of the year. At that point, $100bn in Iranian assets around the world will be unfrozen. Ordinary Iranians, however, will have to wait several months before feeling the economic benefits. Rouhani will hope the influx of money into the ailing economy will come in time for the voters to reward reformists at the parliamentary elections in 2016, and help further change the country’s course. “Today is an end and a beginning … an end to baseless claims and a beginning for a new phase in international relations,” he said on Tuesday. “Today we are at an important juncture in the history of our country and revolution. A new chapter has begun … it shows problems in the world can be solved through less costly ways.” A preliminary outline of the deal was agreed in principle in Lausanne in April , but it left many of the details unresolved and Iran’s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, said his country would only recognise a full and comprehensive agreement. Iran has also pledged to cooperate with an IAEA investigation into evidence of past experiments in nuclear weapons design, mostly dating back over 12 years. The agency’s director general, Yukiya Amano, signed an understanding with Iran’s nuclear chief, Ali Akbar Salehi, on Tuesday morning, in which both undertook to complete the investigation by the end of the year. The IAEA has not committed itself to coming to definite conclusions in that period. It describes the agreement as a “road map” that Amano said “provides for technical expert meetings, technical measures and discussions”. A separate arrangement would be agreed for the IAEA to visit a particularly controversial site, a military base called Parchin. Within a few months, the IAEA verification that Iran has shrunk its nuclear programme will trigger the third phase of the agreement, in which multiple layers of economic and financial sanctions are lifted, and about $100bn in Iranian assets abroad will be unfrozen. There are still many things that can go wrong. The deal could be repudiated by the US Congress with enough Democratic defectors to override a presidential veto. That domestic battle will draw in America’s allies on either side. Netanyahu’s Israeli government is lobbying heavily for the deal to be rejected, as are the Gulf Arab monarchies. The western Europeans will try to counter their influence on US public opinion and Congress. The agreement could also fall apart over the question of Iranian cooperation with the IAEA inquiry into past weaponisation studies, or stumble over a disagreement over whether IAEA inspectors can enter a site run by the Iran’s Revolutionary Guard. But the deal’s supporters believe that if it can survive, the agreement has the potential to redraw Iran’s relations with the US, dampen the likelihood for another war in the Middle East and set a new standard for negotiated non-proliferation, stopping the spread of nuclear weapons in the Middle East and beyond.","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/14/iran-nuclear-programme-world-powers-historic-deal-lift-sanctions"
"Trump Abandons Iran Nuclear Deal He Long Scorned","Advertisement Supported by By  Mark Landler WASHINGTON — President Trump declared on Tuesday that he was withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal, unraveling the signature foreign policy achievement of his predecessor Barack Obama, isolating the United States from its Western allies and sowing uncertainty before a risky nuclear negotiation with North Korea. The decision, while long anticipated and widely telegraphed, leaves the 2015 agreement reached by seven countries after more than two years of grueling negotiations in tatters. The United States will now reimpose the stringent sanctions it imposed on Iran before the deal and is considering new penalties. Iran said it will remain in the deal, which tightly restricted its nuclear ambitions for a decade or more in return for ending the sanctions that had crippled its economy. So did France, Germany and Britain, raising the prospect of a trans-Atlantic clash as European companies face the return of American sanctions for doing business with Iran. China and Russia, also signatories to the deal, are likely to join Iran in accusing the United States of violating the accord. Mr. Trump’s move could embolden hard-line forces in Iran, raising the threat of Iranian retaliation against Israel or the United States, fueling an arms race in the Middle East and fanning sectarian conflicts from Syria to Yemen. The president, however, framed his decision as the fulfillment of a bedrock campaign promise and as the act of a dealmaker dissolving a fatally flawed agreement. He predicted his tough line with Iran would strengthen his hand as he prepared to meet North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, to begin negotiating the surrender of his nuclear arsenal. “This was a horrible one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made,” a grim-faced Mr. Trump said in an 11-minute address from the Diplomatic Reception Room of the White House. “It didn’t bring calm, it didn’t bring peace, and it never will.” Mr. Trump’s announcement drew a chorus of opposition from European leaders, several of whom lobbied him feverishly not to pull out of the agreement and searched for fixes to it that would satisfy him. It also drew a rare public rebuke by Mr. Obama, who said Mr. Trump’s withdrawal would leave the world less safe, confronting it with “a losing choice between a nuclear-armed Iran or another war in the Middle East.” The response from Iran itself, however, was muted. President Hassan Rouhani declared that the Iranians intended to abide by the terms of the deal, and he criticized Mr. Trump for his history of not honoring international treaties. Mr. Trump won strong backing from Saudi Arabia and Israel, whose leader, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, hailed him for a “historic move” and “courageous leadership.” The restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program under the deal could survive. Three times previously, the president’s aides had persuaded him not to dismantle the Iran deal. But Mr. Trump made clear that his patience had worn thin, and with a new, more hawkish cohort of advisers — led by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the national security adviser, John R. Bolton — the president faced less internal resistance than earlier in his administration. While Mr. Trump had long scorned the Iran deal, threatening repeatedly to rip it up during the 2016 presidential race, his impulse to act now was reinforced by what he views as the success of his policy toward North Korea. He has told aides and foreign leaders that his policy of maximum pressure had forced Mr. Kim to the bargaining table, and that a similar policy of overwhelming pressure would enable the United States to extract a better deal from Iran. As Mr. Trump abandoned one diplomatic project, he accelerated another — announcing that Mr. Pompeo was flying to Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea, to continue discussions with Mr. Kim about the upcoming summit meeting. He expressed hope that three Americans who are detained in the North would be released soon. “The message to North Korea,” Mr. Bolton told reporters, “is the president wants a real deal.” He rejected the suggestion that the United States could not be trusted to keep its agreements when political winds change. “Any nation reserves the right to correct a past mistake,” Mr. Bolton said, citing President George W. Bush’s decision to withdraw from the Antiballistic Missile Treaty in 2001. The Trump administration, he said, would continue to work with Europeans to pressure the Iranians. He dismissed those who said the United States was on a path to war with Iran, though he did not present any new diplomatic initiatives. Another senior administration official acknowledged that there was no Plan B. Months of intense negotiations with the Europeans to keep the accord in place collapsed over Mr. Trump’s insistence that the limits placed by the agreement on Iran’s nuclear fuel production were inadequate. Under the provisions of the deal, those limits, or “sunset clauses,” were to expire in 2030 — 15 years after the deal was signed. As a result, the United States will reinstate all the sanctions it had waived as part of the nuclear accord, and it will impose additional economic penalties that are now being drawn up by the Treasury Department. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin declined on Tuesday to specify what additional sanctions the United States might impose, but he expressed confidence that they would still be powerful even if other American allies did not follow suit. “We do not want to let Iran use the U.S. financial markets and financial system and transact in dollars until they agree that not only will they not have a nuclear weapon now, but we’ve put in provisions that they will never have one,” Mr. Mnuchin said. In his announcement, Mr. Trump recited familiar arguments against the deal: that it does not address the threat of Iran’s ballistic missiles or its malign behavior in the region, and that the expiration dates for the sunset clauses open the door to an Iranian nuclear bomb down the road. Even if Iran was in compliance, he said, it could “still be on the verge of a nuclear breakout in just a short period of time.” In fact, under the deal, the limits on Iran’s uranium enrichment and stockpiles of nuclear fuel mean that Iran would not be on the verge of a nuclear breakout until 2030. Still, Mr. Trump said, the United States and its allies could not stop Iran from building a nuclear weapon “under the decaying and rotten structure of the current agreement.” “The Iran deal is defective at its core,” he concluded. Mr. Trump’s announcement capped a frantic four-day period in which American and European diplomats made a last-ditch effort to bridge their differences and preserve the agreement. That effort began Friday, when Mr. Pompeo called his counterparts in Europe to tell them that Mr. Trump was planning to withdraw from the deal, but that he was trying to win a two-week reprieve for the United States and Europe to continue negotiating. Mr. Pompeo, people familiar with the talks said, suggested that he favored a so-called soft withdrawal, in which Mr. Trump would pull out of the deal but hold off on reimposing some of the sanctions. The next day, the State Department’s chief negotiator, Brian H. Hook, consulted with European diplomats to try to break a deadlock over the sunset provision, under which the restrictions on Iran’s ability to produce nuclear fuel for civilian use expire after 15 years. The Europeans had already agreed to a significant compromise: to reimpose sanctions if there were a determination that the Iranians were within 12 months of producing a nuclear weapon. But officials said that still did not satisfy Mr. Trump, and the Europeans were not willing to go any further. By Monday, the White House began informing allies that Mr. Trump was going to withdraw from the deal and reimpose sanctions on oil and impose new sanctions against the Central Bank of Iran. Under the financial sanctions, European companies will have 90 to 180 days to wind down their operations in Iran, or they will run afoul of the American banking system. The sanctions on oil will require European and Asian countries to reduce their imports from Iran. Mr. Mnuchin insisted that the restrictions would not drive up oil prices because other suppliers would pick up the slack. “My expectation is not that oil prices go higher,” he said. “To a certain extent, some of this was already in the market on oil prices.” Mr. Trump’s decision will test his already frayed relationship with European leaders. President Emmanuel Macron of France, whom the president welcomed with a state dinner two weeks ago, learned of his decision in a phone call with Mr. Trump on Tuesday morning. Later, he said in a post on Twitter that the European allies “regret” his decision. “The international regime against nuclear proliferation is at stake,” he added. In a joint statement, Mr. Macron, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain noted pointedly that the United Nations Security Council resolution endorsing the nuclear deal remained the “binding international legal framework for the resolution of the dispute.” That raises the possibility that the United States will be found to be in violation in the Security Council. Few people were more stung by Mr. Trump’s decision than those who worked for Mr. Obama. Though he has moved methodically to dismantle his predecessor’s legacy, his reversal of the Iran deal was particularly painful, given the five years of effort that went into imposing sanctions, and the more than two-year-long negotiation led by Secretary of State John Kerry that yielded the accord. “No rhetoric is required,” Mr. Kerry said in a statement. “The facts speak for themselves. Instead of building on unprecedented nonproliferation verification measures, this decision risks throwing them away and dragging the world back to the brink we faced a few years ago.” Reporting was contributed by Peter Baker, Alan Rappeport, David E.

"Theresa May faces Israeli pressure over Iran nuclear deal","PM tells Benjamin Netanyahu that Britain still backs deal, and raises issue of Palestinian deaths  Patrick Wintour Diplomatic editor and agencies  Wed 6 Jun 2018 11.04 EDT   Last modified on Fri 8 Jun 2018 08.48 EDT   Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu , has pressed Theresa May to recognise that the Iranian nuclear deal is on the point of collapse and that a fresh plan is needed to stop Iran restarting its uranium enrichment programme. Netanyahu met May on Wednesday following his talks this week with the other European supporters of the landmark 2015 nuclear deal, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and Germany’s chancellor, Angela Merkel. Netanyahu has lobbied for European leaders to follow the example of the US president, Donald Trump , and pull out of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) on Iran. “Along with France and Germany, the UK continues to believe [the JCPOA] is the best route to preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon,” May said. “We will remain committed to it as long as Iran meets its obligations. But we do recognise that there are other issues that need to be addressed in relation to Iran – its destabilising regional activity in countries like Syria and Yemen and also the proliferation of ballistic missiles.” Netanyahu told May he was focused on making sure Iran did not get a nuclear weapon and on “how to roll back Iran’s aggression in the region”. The European signatories are scrambling to save the accord, which they see as crucial to forestalling an Iranian nuclear weapon. However, the US president has said the deal is deeply flawed. The Israeli pressure is designed not only to back Trump’s decision to pull out of the deal but also to force European firms to disinvest from Iran. May also raised the subject of the UN’s call for an independent inquiry into the killing of dozens of Palestinian protesters on the day the US moved its embassy to Jerusalem . May stressed she recognised Israel’s right to self-defence but called on Netanyahu to act to alleviate the situation. The Israeli prime minister insisted the protests were driven by the militant group Hamas and that the response was aimed at minimising causalities. Rival groups of protesters gathered outside Downing Street waving Palestinian and Israeli flags before Netanyahu’s arrival. On Tuesday, Iran said it had ordered preparations for increasing uranium enrichment capacity in case the nuclear agreement collapsed. It also announced it had completed a new centrifuge assembly centre at the Natanz nuclear site. The French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, said the move stopped short of breaching the terms of the nuclear deal, but came close to crossing the red line. “This initiative is unwelcome. It shows a sort of irritation,” he told Europe 1 radio. “It is always dangerous to flirt with the red lines, but the initiative taken … remains totally within the framework of the Vienna [nuclear] deal.” The finance ministers and foreign secretaries of the UK, Germany and France have jointly written to their US counterparts seeking assurances that the US will not impose secondary sanctions on EU firms operating in Iran. Their letter says that JCPOA is “the best means through which we can prevent a nuclear armed Iran”. Speaking in France ahead of his meeting with May, Netanyahu was confident that the EU firms operating in Iran would not be able to resist US sanctions. “I didn’t ask France to withdraw from JCPOA because I think it will be dissolved by weight of economic forces. My interest is not this or that agreement but to make sure Iran does not have nuclear weapons, and the last thing anyone wants is to have this theocratic dictatorship [with] a nuclear arsenal,” he said. Several big companies, including France’s Total and the Netherlands’ Maersk, have already said it would be impossible to stay in Iran once sanctions were fully reimposed over the next six months, unless they received explicit exemptions from Washington. Boeing also announced it was cancelling plans to provide two Iranian carriers. The European Investment Bank said on Wednesday that it could not help shield trade between the EU and Iran from US sanctions, dashing the hopes of some EU finance ministers that it might be a source of finance for EU firms operating in Iran. The bank said it “should remain a solid and credible institution on the international capital markets, and this would be incompatible with ignoring possible sanctions against Iran”.","https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/06/theresa-may-israel-iran-nuclear-deal-benjamin-netanyahu"

"What is the Iran nuclear deal?","The Iran nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action , offered Tehran billions of dollars in sanctions relief in exchange for agreeing to curb its nuclear program. The agreement was aimed at ensuring that "Iran's nuclear program will be exclusively peaceful." In return, it lifted U.N. Security Council and other sanctions, including in areas covering trade, technology, finance and energy. The deal was sealed in July 2015, under President Barack Obama. Tehran acceded to a 10-year restriction on nuclear production , agreed to shut down thousands of centrifuges and exported almost all of its bomb-making material. Under the agreement, Iran agreed that "under no circumstances will Iran ever seek, develop or acquire any nuclear weapons." Iran also allowed a strict monitoring regime, permitting international inspectors to gain access to sites suspected of nuclear weapons-related activities. The agreement did allow for a commercial nuclear program "for exclusively peaceful purposes." Iran signed the agreement with the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council — the U.S., Russia, France, China and the United Kingdom — as well as Germany and the European Union. As of May 2018, there was broad consensus that Iran has abided by the agreement . Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, however, has alleged that "Iran lied" about its nuclear weapon ambitions in the 2000s, although the information he shared seemed to match up with what nuclear inspectors had already reported about Tehran's program. Critics also allege that the deal itself is flawed and does not prevent Iran from engaging in aggressive actions that fall outside the pact’s purview, such as pursuing a ballistic missile program and expiration dates on some restrictions, as well as extending its influence throughout the region. President Donald Trump has made no secret of his dislike for the agreement, calling it “the worst deal ever” while on the campaign trail. On May 8, 2018, Trump announced the U.S. would reimpose sanctions on Iran , leaving other nations involved scrambling to salvage the pact . Restoring sanctions amounts to a U.S. breach of the original deal whereas Iran was deemed to be compliant, according to international nuclear inspectors. On the other hand, some experts see the Iran nuclear deal as a good scenario for denuclearizing North Korea . While the two cases are “very different,” Iran offers lessons to those involved in similar negotiations with North Korea, according to Suzanne DiMaggio, a senior fellow at New America, a Washington think tank where she directs a long-running U.S.-Iran policy dialogue. “The process of diplomacy that the United States pursued with Iran could offer some insights on how to begin engagement with an adversary whose leadership is extremely distrustful of the United States and vice versa,” she wrote in a post for the Arms Control Association. Regional U.S. allies, such as Saudi Arabia and Israel, are vehemently against the agreement, saying it has not worked to curb Iran’s aggressiveness or ambitions. Some of Iran's policies in the Middle East run counter to U.S. interests and those of its allies. Tehran threatens Israel, backs Hezbollah — a powerful Lebanese militia and political group — and is involved in conflicts in Yemen, Iraq and Bahrain. The Trump White House has also been critical of Iran for its support of President Bashar al-Assad during Syria's seven-year civil war. Other countries that signed the deal with the U.S., including allies France, Britain and France , called on Washington to stick to the agreement . French President Emmanuel Macron has said that while it was imperfect, there is no “Plan B.” German Chancellor Angela Merkel has also defended the pact, saying that an imperfect deal is better than no deal and that her country will "watch very closely" to ensure it is being fulfilled. Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif says the deal is "not negotiable." © 2019 NBC UNIVERSAL","https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/smart-facts/what-iran-nuclear-deal-n868346"
"Will the Iran nuclear deal survive Trump’s wrecking crew?","If the US pulls out, we could be heading down the path of another senseless war. That’s why the forces of the UN, Congress and the American public are so pivotal  Fri 27 Apr 2018 06.00 EDT   Last modified on Mon 7 May 2018 22.07 EDT   O n 12 May, President Trump will decide whether or not to stay in the Iran nuclear deal . If the US pulls out, as Trump has threatened to do, we could be careening down the path of another catastrophic, senseless war in the Middle East. That’s why the countervailing forces of European leaders, the UN, the US Congress and the American public are so pivotal. The US already made a catastrophic blunder in Iran, a blunder that is still reverberating six decades later. In a foreign policy speech delivered in September 2017, Senator Bernie Sanders talked about the 1953 CIA coup that toppled Iran’s elected prime minister, Mohammad Mosaddegh, on behalf of western oil interests, and the reinstallation of the corrupt, brutal and unpopular Shah. Sanders explained that in 1979, the Shah was overthrown by anti-American revolutionaries led by Ayatollah Khomeini, and the Islamic Republic of Iran was created. Then he mused : “What would Iran look like today if their democratic government had not been overthrown? What impact did that American-led coup have on the entire region? What consequences are we still living with today?” To answer Sanders’ questions, without the CIA coup , there would probably never have been an Islamic revolution in 1979 or a decades-long conflict between Iranian leaders and the west. The 1979 revolution impacted the region by unleashing ferocious schisms. The new Iranian Shia leadership began vying for supremacy in the Middle East with Sunni-majority Saudi Arabia, a bitter rivalry that continues today. The 1979 revolution also created a crisis between Israel and Iran , with Iran’s religious leaders viewing the Israelis as US puppets and denouncing the oppression of Palestinians. Today, both the Saudis and Israelis are trying to suck the US into their decades-old feud with Iran. They have both opposed the Iran nuclear deal . Israel has been advocating for the US military to bomb Iran’s nuclear facilities, even though Israel has several hundred nuclear weapons of its own and Iran has none. Saudi Arabia insists that Iran is spreading terrorism throughout the region, even though the Saudis have spent billions of dollars spreading their intolerant version of Islam, Wahhabism, around the world. It is the Saudi’s extremist Sunni ideology , not Shiism, that forms the theological underpinnings of radical terrorist groups from al-Qaeda to Isis. While less oppressive than the Saudi monarchy, the Iranian theocracy is no model democracy. It restricts the freedoms of its citizens and gives the clerics too much power over all other branches of government. But upending the nuclear agreement will be a boon to Iran’s conservative clerics, the very ones we don’t want to embolden. President Hassan Rouhani, considered a moderate, will lose power to the hardliners, who were against negotiating with the west from the get-go. The ascendance of the conservatives could lead to a backlash against the more secular, liberal forces in Iran. Strengthening the hardliners would also spell more chaos in the region. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) is Iran’s elite military force responsible for protecting the Islamic regime from internal and external threats. The IRGC and its allies like Hezbollah are fighting proxy wars against the Saudis from Yemen to Syria. But Trump’s concerns about Iranian support for the “three Hs” – Hezbollah, Hamas and the Houthis – will be exacerbated if the deal is undone, as the IRGC will have an even greater justification to oppose US policies in the Middle East and to target US allies. The IRGC could immediately retaliate by attacking both Israel and US troops stationed in Iraq, Afghanistan and on military bases throughout the Middle East. If the US breaks with the nuclear deal, Iran would be free to reconstitute its nuclear program and quickly move ahead. It could install more centrifuges and produce as much enriched uranium or plutonium as it wants. If US officials are troubled by Iran’s foreign policy now, imagine how much more powerful a nuclear-armed Iran would be. That’s why Trump’s own secretary of defense, James Mattis, has said that keeping the nuclear agreement intact is in the US national interest. It is also why the other signatories to the agreement – France, Britain, Germany, Russia and China – want to keep it. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, just visited Washington DC, trying to convince Trump not to pull out, and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, is meeting with Trump on Friday with the same message. The nuclear agreement was not only made between six nations, but by the entire UN system. The UN security council approved the deal by a 15-0 vote. Putting the deal in jeopardy would compromise the entire international framework for nonviolent conflict resolution and sink international respect for US leadership to a new low. This is a particularly critical point right now, with momentous talks with North Korea tentatively scheduled for May. Breaking the Iran deal will put those talks in jeopardy. Why would Kim Jong-un sign an agreement with Trump if he goes back on a deal already signed with Iran, a deal that Iran was complying with, a deal that was approved by the entire international community? The Trump administration should not only honor the agreement, it should use it as a springboard to work with Iran to defuse the conflicts consuming the region and to normalize relations with Tehran. Unfortunately, the triumvirate of Trump, the national security adviser, John Bolton, and secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, are likely to pull in the opposite direction. It’s up to us to push back. Before the Trump wrecking crew destroys the best global foreign policy achievement in the last decade, the world community – including the UN, Congress and the public – has to stop them.","https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/27/iran-nuclear-deal-survive-trump-wrecking-crew"
"As Donald Trump Eyes Iran Nuclear Deal, North Korea Is Watching","As the French president urged his American counterpart to press for new concessions, Iran’s foreign minister says Tehran won’t accept any changes to the deal Obama agreed to. He came, he saw, he cajoled. French President Emmanuel Macron on a state visit to Washington on Tuesday may actually have persuaded President Donald Trump—who called him a “great friend” and a “leader”—that simply tearing up the deal with Iran that froze its nuclear program until 2025 would not be a good idea. But if Trump embraces the kind of program Macron is talking about, which includes pushing Iran to make a whole new series of concessions on other issues, the situation in the war-torn Middle East could grow a whole lot worse before it gets better. The reason, according to Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, who has been making the diplomatic and journalistic rounds in New York, is that Tehran is not going to agree to anything beyond the current nuclear accords painstakingly negotiated with the Obama administration. And Zarif suggested that added pressure may make even that existing deal worth less than the paper it is printed on. Trump is due to make his decision by May 12. North Korea, which has close and controversial ties to Iran, will be watching closely, and Zarif notes that any leader, including Kim Jong Un, would see little value in agreements with Washington that would last only as long as the term of the president who signed them. So, while Trump may have high hopes for his upcoming talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, the “Little Rocket Man” he decided to describe on Tuesday as “very honorable,” Zarif is blunt: “People will not be prepared to give if the take is only temporary.” Macron, for his part, tried to put the Iran deal in a context that would be easy for Trump to understand and, he hoped, for Trump to explain to his core supporters. What the two presidents sketched out in their remarks on Tuesday would have four central “pillars,” as Macron put it. First is maintenance of the current nuclear deal , the so-called Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) agreed to in 2015 by Iran, the United States, France, Britain, Germany, Russia and China. At the time it went into effect, Iran was within months of producing enough nuclear material to start building atomic weapons, if it so chose. Those operations were halted for 10 years, and in return Iran’s long-frozen assets in the West were released, while some international sanctions were lifted. The hope was that this would usher in a new era of more positive relations. But that was not to be. “The United States, under President Trump … has violated almost every U.S. commitment under the JCPOA, so we’ve had almost 16 months of a trial period for official withdrawal,” Zarif told The National Interest . “If the United States officially withdraws from the JCPOA, the immediate implication would be that it would free Iran of any obligation to remain …” Zarif says the pressure Trump already has put on U.S. allies to curtail trade also has undermined the credibility of the original deal, which President Hassan Rouhani had promised his people would bring new prosperity. The Trump administration has “taken every measure in order to make sure that Iran does not benefit economically from the deal,” Zarif told CBS in an interview broadcast Sunday. “If the benefits of the deal for Iran start to diminish, then there is no reason for Iran to remain in the deal. Because it’s not acceptable for us to have a one-sided agreement.” In recent months, the value of Iran’s currency has plummeted, strengthening the hand of hard liners in Tehran who never wanted the nuclear agreement in the first place. So, if the deal falls apart, Zarif told CBS, then, “as the United States has a habit of saying, ‘All options are on the table,’” and those would include “resuming at a much greater speed our nuclear activities.” Zarif insists that would not mean building nukes, but without the JCPOA and the inspections that are part of it, the West would once again be dealing with “unknown unknowns” about weapons of mass destruction, much as it was before the invasion of Iraq. The second pillar of policy that Macron presented to Trump is the idea that a new accord must be negotiated for what happens in “the long run” after 2025 , when the current agreement expires. Critics of the deal have always denounced it as too temporary, leaving the door open at the end for Iran to race toward the development of nuclear weapons. Zarif points out that the first paragraphs of the accord repeat multiple times the Iranian commitment to an “exclusively peaceful” nuclear program. The third pillar, and in Macron’s view a separate agreement, would lead to the curtailing Iran’s ballistic missile program. In fact, U.N. Security Council Resolution 2231 imposed missile-related restrictions that Iran has violated repeatedly and unapologetically, insisting they are not part of the accord itself. “They ignored them in the past, and they continue to ignore them,” says Valerie Lincy of The Wisconsin Project, which watches these developments closely. Not least of the concerns is that Iran and North Korea may be sharing technology or hardware for their missile programs. The fourth pillar is to block Iran’s expanding influence on the ground , directly or through client militias, in Iraq, Syria and Yemen. In all three countries, to varying degrees, Iran sees itself supporting local forces to fight Sunni jihadists and wage a proxy war against Saudi Arabia. “We are responding to a threat created by U.S. allies,” Zarif told members of the Council of Foreign Relations in New York on Monday. It is to help contain Iran that Macron argued the United States must maintain a military presence in the east of Syria even after the so-called Islamic State has been obliterated. Defense Secretary James Mattis and other Trump advisers have made similar arguments, despite Trump’s stated wish to get all 2,000 American forces out of there. And Trump may actually have listened. While he used to say flatly that the U.S. soldiers would be back home “soon,” he now adds the indeterminate phrase, “as possible.” When Trump rattled off his views on Syria, there was a certain echo of Macron’s. Iran must be stopped from profiting off the success of the American-led coalition defeating ISIS, and must be prevented from establishing a so-called land bridge stretching through Iraq and Syria all the way to the Mediterranean, Trump said. Others, meaning mainly the Saudis, must help pay the bills, and they should send troops as well. At the end of the day, how all this will stabilize the region is unclear. The Four Pillars of Macron, if met by Iranian resistance and retaliation, will have done little to bring peace. But such is the confusion in Washington that any framework for dealing with the chaos of the Middle East must be welcome, even to Donald Trump. Got a tip?

            Business  Hours after President Donald Trump blasted the deal as "insane," French President Emmanuel Macron said he expected Trump to pull the United States out next month "for domestic reasons," according to several reports. German Chancellor Angela Merkel is likely to lobby Trump to stick with the accord when she meets him on Friday. Europe is trying to save a deal signed in 2015 under which the United States and other powers agreed to lift some economic sanctions in return for Iran agreeing to rein in its nuclear program. Trump has vowed to rip up the agreement, which he has described as "the worst deal ever." He's now threatening to reject an extension of the agreement ahead of a May 12 deadline. So who loses out if Trump does decide to abandon the nuclear deal?  Iran has the fourth largest crude oil reserves in the world and claims nearly one-fifth of the planet's natural gas. The country has ramped up production since sanctions were eased to about 3.8 million barrels a day. That's about a million barrels a day more than in 2015. New sanctions on Iranian oil exports would put a dent in global supply and could cause prices to spike higher. They've already soared 13% this year to their highest level in three years, and the price of US gas has jumped to a national average of $2.79 a gallon. "A lot of the reason for higher prices is the president's policy on Iran," said Joe McMonigle, senior energy policy analyst at Hedgeye Risk Management last week. "You're talking about a huge amount of oil at risk. You're going to see prices spike."  Related: Surging oil prices rattle President Trump   The biggest deals signed with foreign companies so far have been for airplanes to modernize Iran's creaking fleet.  Boeing  ( BA ) signed an $8 billion deal to sell 80 jets to Iran Air after the sanctions were lifted. The first jets are due to be delivered this year. Boeing has said the airplane sales to Iran Air will directly support tens of thousands of US jobs . The company noted that 100,000 Boeing employees will be involved with making good on the deal. It has also agreed to sell 30 737 MAX airplanes worth $3 billion to Aseman Airlines, another Iranian carrier. European rival Airbus  ( EADSF ) wants a share of the action too. It has agreed to sell 100 jets to Iran for about $10 billion. Those sales could be in trouble if Trump reintroduces sanctions because Airbus uses parts made in America.  While many major foreign companies have remained on the sidelines because of fears over a return of sanctions, a handful have jumped in.  Total  ( TOT ) signed a $2 billion agreement to help develop Iran's giant South Pars gas field, together with Chinese state oil company CNPC. But the French company has cautioned that a tough approach from Trump could kill the deal. "Either we can do the deal legally if there is a legal framework," CEO Patrick Pouyanné told CNNMoney last year. "If we cannot do that for legal reasons ... then we have to revisit it."  General Electric  ( GE ) has received millions of dollars in orders from Iran in 2017, according to company filings, for its oil and gas business. In 2017, Germany's Volkswagen  ( VLKAF ) announced that it will sell cars in Iran for the first time in 17 years.  Travel operators have taken advantage of the renewed interest in Iran as a business and tourist destination since sanctions were eased. European airlines such as British Airways and Lufthansa  ( DLAKF ) have resumed direct flights to the country, and Iranian authorities have relaxed visa requirements. France's Accor  ( ACCYY ) was the first international hotel chain to open in Iran in 2015. Spain's Melia  ( SMIZF ) and Rotana of the United Arab Emirates have also announced plans to open hotels in Iran.  Growth has returned to Iran in recent years, but the economic recovery remains fragile. "As the full suite of American sanctions, including penalties on importing Iranian crude oil, snap back into place, Iran's precarious economic situation will certainly deteriorate," Suzanne Maloney, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, wrote earlier this month. There have been warning signs already. The Iranian rial has plunged against the US dollar in recent months. The currency has lost roughly a third of its value over the past year, and media reports suggest the decline has been steeper on black market exchanges. The fall has made imports more expensive, and some Iranians are reportedly cashing in their savings to buy dollars and euros. Unhappiness over the economy, and the government's management of the situation, helped fuel major protests in late 2017.  -- CNN's Ivana Kottasová and Zahraa Alkhalisi contributed to this report.

"Fact check: Trump's claim that Iran could build nuclear weapons in seven years","President Donald Trump speaks April 3 during a news conference in Washington, D.C. President Donald Trump speaks April 3 during a news conference in Washington, D.C. Trump has never liked the Iran nuclear deal and may decide to withdraw the United States from further participation. The president says he will announce his decision Tuesday. Whatever he decides, Trump said, the international agreement would expire in seven years anyway and Iran would be able to build nuclear weapons regardless. The nuclear accord came after years of diplomacy and negotiations over Iran's nuclear ambitions, culminating in 2015 during President Barack Obama 's administration. "The Iran nuclear deal is a terrible one for the United States and the world," Trump tweeted in April 2015, a day after the deal's framework was finalized. "It does nothing but make Iran rich and will lead to catastrophe." Is Iran "free to go ahead and create nuclear weapons" after seven years? The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action was adopted in October 2015 and formally implemented on Jan. 16, 2016, by the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council — China, France, Russia, Britain and the United States — and Germany and Iran. Iran agreed to constraints meant to ensure that its nuclear program will be used only for peaceful purposes, such as energy production. In exchange, the United States, the European Union and the United Nations agreed to lift a broad range of sanctions on Iran. U.S. allies say the Iran deal has helped maintain stability. Critics of the deal say that the broad lifting of sanctions has enabled Iran to increase its influence in a volatile region and that the accord does not restrict Iran from developing ballistic missiles. On Monday afternoon, President donald Trump declared via Twitter that his decision on the Iran deal will come Tuesday. The 2015 accord - signed by the United States, the U.K., France, Germany, Russia, China and Iran -- lifts economic sanctions against Iran. In exchange, Tehran gave up its ability... Trump is one of those critics. But it's not clear what he meant by saying the deal would expire in seven years. The White House did not respond to our questions. The president may have been referring to "Termination Day" in October 2025, when provisions of a U.N. resolution endorsing the deal expire, or he may have been referring to the fact that some provisions of the JCPOA itself expire 10 years into the deal, also in 2025. "Nevertheless, President Trump's statement indicates either abject confusion over the parameters of the JCPOA or a willful misinterpretation of that deal," said Alexandra Bell, senior policy director at the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation. "Either way, it is dangerous, as Iran will never be 'free to go ahead and create nuclear weapons.' " As a signatory to the Non-Proliferation Treaty, Iran has pledged not to develop nuclear weapons — ever. In agreeing to the JCPOA, Iran recommitted itself to the Non-Proliferation Treaty, Bell said. "The NPT is of indefinite duration and serves as the underpinning for the entire global nonproliferation regime," she said. Iran also has agreed to abide by the International Atomic Energy Agency 's Additional Protocol. It has committed to ratify this agreement in 2023. The IAEA already has the ability to investigate nuclear facilities and activities disclosed by Iran's government. The Additional Protocol supplements those powers by giving IAEA investigators the "ability to investigate undeclared nuclear facilities and activities by increasing the IAEA's authority to inspect certain nuclear-related facilities and demand information from member states," according to a 2017 report by the Congressional Research Service. Simply put, Iran has agreed to give international inspectors wide-ranging authority to peer into its nuclear activities. According to a timeline from the Brookings Institution, Iran would be free to develop, test and use more advanced types of uranium-enriching centrifuges and upgrade a nuclear facility in Natanz after "Termination Day" in October 2025. But Iran would continue to be limited to peaceful programs; developing nuclear weapons would remain banned. The JCPOA limits the number of IR-1 centrifuges Iran may have at its Natanz plant to 5,060 and it restricts the "number and type of more advanced centrifuges that may be tested over this period," according to a timeline from the Nuclear Threat Initiative produced by the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, California. Those restrictions expire in 2025. (IR-1 centrifuges are decades old and not very efficient.) But other parts of the JCPOA would remain in force for another five, 10 or 15 years, according to the NTI timeline, including international monitoring of Iran's production of uranium ore and centrifuge parts, and restrictions on uranium enrichment and reprocessing of spent fuel. "Many measures associated with the JCPOA sunset later than seven years, and others do not sunset at all," said Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia nonproliferation program at the Center for Nonproliferation Studies. He called Trump's claim "completely false." The JCPOA strengthens the restrictions Iran faces under the Non-Proliferation Treaty in perpetuity, Lewis added. "Under Article II [of the Non-Proliferation Treaty], Iran may not 'manufacture or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices,' " Lewis said. "But did Iran's pre-2003 nuclear weapons research constitute the 'manufacture' of nuclear weapons? I said yes at the time, but Iran's defenders said that it did not — they claimed that research and development fell short of the definition of 'manufacture.' The JCPOA settles this debate by barring Iran from conducting research and development, prohibiting an itemized list of the pre-2003 activities. This provision does not sunset." Similar processes are involved in pursuing a nuclear energy program and a nuclear weapons program, which is why monitoring is key. "Iran has nuclear programs that could potentially provide Tehran with the capability to produce both weapons-grade highly enriched uranium (HEU) and plutonium — the two types of fissile material used in nuclear weapons," according to the report from the Congressional Research Service. "Statements from the U.S. intelligence community indicate that Iran has the technological and industrial capacity to produce nuclear weapons at some point, but the U.S. government assesses that Tehran has not mastered all of the necessary technologies for building a nuclear weapon." In addition to the production of weapons-grade nuclear material, a nuclear weapons program requires other key elements, such as warhead design and reliable delivery systems. David Albright, president of the Institute for Science and International Security and a skeptic of the Iran deal, and Andrea Stricker, a senior policy analyst at that institute, wrote in an op-ed in January that the nuclear accord potentially opens the door to Iran achieving "breakout capability" for a nuclear bomb in about a decade. "Left unchecked, in about a decade Iran will be closer to producing enough nuclear fuel for a bomb — a 'breakout capability' — than it was before the agreement was finalized in 2015," they wrote. "The Europeans recognize the danger of allowing the sunset clauses to stand, yet they haven't offered any serious solutions. They are, however, rebuilding business with the Islamic Republic. Although the nuclear deal placed restrictions on Tehran's gas centrifuge uranium-enrichment program, the regime will be allowed in just six years to ramp up the centrifuge manufacturing process essential for the production of thousands of advanced centrifuges." It's worth noting that as part of the JCPOA, Iran said it was bound by this commitment: "Iran reaffirms that under no circumstances will Iran ever seek, develop or acquire any nuclear weapons." According to the Congressional Research Service report, "Officials from both the Barack Obama and Donald Trump administrations have certified that Iran is abiding by its JCPOA commitments." It's fair to be skeptical of the Iran deal. But Trump's assertion that the JCPOA is set to expire in seven years and that Iran would be free to build nuclear weapons afterward is simply not accurate. Whether the president was referring to "Termination Day" in 2025, or to the portions of the JCPOA that sunset in 2025, Iran has pledged to never develop nuclear weapons. The Non-Proliferation Treaty, the IAEA's Additional Protocol and other parts of the JCPOA — all of which Iran has committed to — run well past 2025, and key provisions apply indefinitely. Trump knows how to hedge these types of comments about the Iran deal. He's done it before. ("The deal allows Iran to continue developing certain elements of its nuclear program and, importantly, in just a few years, as key restrictions disappear, Iran can sprint towards a rapid nuclear weapons breakout," he said in an October 2017 speech.) But in this case, the president's misleading and inaccurate statements are worthy of Four Pinocchios .","https://www.chicagotribune.com/nation-world/ct-fact-check-trump-iran-deal-20180508-story.html"
"John Bolton is a serial arms control killer","Opinion  Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events  John Bolton relishes in targeting nuclear arms treaties. He is very good at it. The U.S. national security adviser’s latest hit is the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, but his list of victims goes back decades. He had a hand in either the U.S. withdrawal or repeal of Richard Nixon’s Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, Bill Clinton’s Agreed Framework with North Korea and Barack Obama’s Iran nuclear deal. Now he has helped put the knife into Ronald Reagan’s landmark treaty, one that broke the back of the nuclear arms race in 1987. It was the first time that the United States and the Soviet Union agreed to destroy, not just limit, nuclear weapons. Together they destroyed almost 2,700 perfectly good nuclear weapons that they had spent billions of dollars and many years building. It began the process of massive reductions in global nuclear arms that continued until the current administration. Why is Bolton against these nuclear security treaties that Republicans and Democrats, conservatives and liberals, have championed? Because he thinks they make America weak. In 1999, he decried the liberal “fascination with arms-control agreements as a substitute for real non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.” A year later, he ridiculed “the Church of Arms Control.” For Bolton and others like him, these agreements are part of the effort by the global Lilliputians to tie down the American Gulliver. In his mind, we must have maximum flexibility and multiple military options to preserve our security and interests around the world. We must protect our nation with military might, not pieces of paper. Russia is likely in violation of the INF Treaty. It has deployed missiles near its border with Europe at ranges that exceed those allowed by the agreement. But when someone breaks the law, the answer is not to repeal the law. There are well-established methods for bringing an offending nation back into compliance. Reagan, in fact, negotiated the INF Treaty while the Soviets were in violation of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. He pushed and cajoled them for several years. After signing the INF Treaty, former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev relented and shut down the offending radar. We could do the same for the INF Treaty by pushing for an agreement on mutual inspections, as many experts have suggested. But Bolton does not want to fix the treaty; he wants to kill it. “Violations give America the opportunity to discard obsolete, Cold War-era limits on its own arsenal and to upgrade its military capabilities to match its global responsibilities,” Bolton wrote in 2014. America will pay a high price for this rigid ideology. President Trump walking out of Reagan’s treaty is a gift to Russian President Vladimir Putin. It doesn’t fix the problem; it makes it worse. Now, there will be no restraints whatsoever on Putin’s ability to deploy hundreds of missiles, should he desire. The United States will likely be blamed for the collapse of the treaty, widening the split within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Europeans are already shaken by the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate accord, the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Iran nuclear deal. This will increase their doubts about U.S. commitment to their security. All this plays into Putin’s hands. It raises serious questions about whether Putin and Trump discussed this in any of their five secretive meetings. Whatever Bolton’s ideological agenda, this is certainly helping not hurting Putin’s Russia. This goes beyond geopolitical advantage. For those who followed the arms race of the 1980s, it feels like déjà vu to again watch countries matching adversaries’ military deployments with their own in a futile effort to overcome or intimidate. And this time, it isn’t just a two-nation race. For some, the real payoff for leaving the INF Treaty is that it will allow the United States to deploy new missiles against China’s medium and intermediate-range missiles, even though we already have multiple ways to target their systems and vastly more nuclear weapons. Thankfully, Congress has indicated that it will not idly watch as the nuclear security house burns down. Last Thursday, 10 senators, led by Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) and including three Democratic 2020 presidential candidates, introduced legislation barring any funding for any new weapon that would violate the INF Treaty. The House is certain to follow suit. Congressional and European pressure may yet combine to pull Trump back from this self-destructive brink. European Union Foreign Policy Chief Federica Mogherini called on Friday for both sides to stick to the treaty. “What we definitely don’t want to see is our continent going back to being a battlefield or a place where other superpowers confront themselves,” she said. “This belongs to a faraway history.” The danger is that the INF Treaty is not the last arms control treaty to die. Many fear that Bolton has his eyes on the New START agreement that limits long-range nuclear forces. That treaty expires in 2021, unless we act to extend it. Otherwise, for the first time since 1972, there will be no limits on U.S. and Russian nuclear forces. Bolton must be stopped before he strikes again.

US announces pullout from treaty with Russia that's been a centerpiece of nuclear arms control since the Cold War. (Feb. 1) AP WASHINGTON – The Trump administration will halt U.S. compliance with a nuclear arms control treaty with Russia, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Friday, citing Moscow's "brazen" violations of a pact that has been a cornerstone of nonproliferation since the Cold War. "For almost six years, the United States has gone to tremendous lengths to preserve this agreement," Pompeo said. He said the Kremlin's repeated denials that it has developed a covert missile system in violation of the treaty has left America and its European allies at immense risk. "Russia has jeopardized the United States' security interests, and we can no longer be restricted by the treaty while Russia shamelessly violates it," Pompeo said. The U.S.  suspended compliance with the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty , known as INF, on Feb. 2 and began a six-month formal withdrawal process, Pompeo said. That gives Moscow time to reverse course – even as the Trump administration begins to look at developing and deploying new intermediate-range missiles. "We will move forward with developing our own military response options and will work with NATO and our other allies and partners to deny Russia any military advantage from its unlawful conduct," President Donald Trump said in a statement on Friday. Supporters of the move said it was long overdue after years of trying to cajole Russia back into compliance proved fruitless. “The Russian government has had endless opportunities to change their bad behavior and ... has proven its disinterest in doing so," said Sen. James Risch, R-Idaho, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. "The time has come to set the treaty aside and develop alternative avenues toward the security the treaty once provided.” NATO's secretary-general said Tuesday he is confident that both the Western military alliance and Russia "will act in a respectable way" as the two sides hold drills in the same area in waters off Norway's coast. (Oct. 30) AP The administration's decision will free the United States to confront other emerging security threats, principally China's buildup of intermediate-range missiles. But critics said abandoning the 32-year-old treaty could spark a new arms race, undermine American credibility and put Europe at risk of Russian aggression. “Russia’s brazen noncompliance with this treaty is deeply concerning, but discarding a key pillar of our nonproliferation security framework creates unacceptable risks," said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. "The administration should exhaust every diplomatic effort and work closely with NATO allies over the next six months to avoid thrusting the United States into a dangerous arms competition." Though experts do not dispute Russia's violations, proponents of arms control argue the U.S. decision will allow Russia to be more overt and aggressive. "This really changes the dynamic where Russia could deploy systems are that are much more offensive and that upsets the security balance in Europe, because it can hold at risk a lot of the countries who are NATO allies and partners," said Rachel Ellehuus, deputy director and senior fellow with the Europe Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. Russia will now be able "to turn the narrative on the United States and NATO and essentially say 'We need to defend ourselves, and the way we defend ourselves is by deploying these systems in our neighborhood,'" Ellehuus said. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Friday that Russia greeted the decision with "much regret" and blamed the U.S. for the INF's collapse. He said Washington has been “unwilling to hold any substantial talks” to save it. The INF Treaty, signed in 1987 by President Ronald Reagan and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, bars the U.S. and Russia from deploying ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges of  310 to 3,400 miles. The agreement led to the elimination of nearly 3,000 missiles with nuclear and conventional warheads and contributed to the end of the Cold War. But the U.S. has long accused Russia of violating the pact – stretching back to the Obama administration. European leaders also have accused Russia of cheating on the agreement, even as Kremlin officials insisted Russia was in compliance. In a statement Friday, NATO strongly backed the Trump administration's move and said Russia was to blame for the U.S. decision. "The United States is taking this action in response to the significant risks to Euro-Atlantic security posed by Russia’s covert testing, production, and fielding of 9M729 ground-launched cruise missile systems," NATO said in its statement. "Allies fully support this action." It's not clear yet how European allies will respond. It's possible that NATO would allow the U.S. to deploy ground-launched missiles in Europe, but that step probably would provoke Russia even more and would risk a public backlash across the continent. "NATO continues to closely review the security implications of Russian intermediate-range missiles and will continue to take steps necessary to ensure the credibility and effectiveness of the Alliance’s overall deterrence and defence posture," NATO said Friday. "We will continue to consult each other regularly with a view to ensuring our collective security." Ellehuus said the Europeans could move in one of two directions. "They could argue 'Gosh, we need a stronger nuclear deterrent,' and then we’re in a new arms race," she said. "Or they could say: 'You know what? The U.S. doesn’t have our back anyway; we want all U.S. nuclear weapons out of Europe.'" A senior administration official, who was not authorized to speak on the record, said the Pentagon has started on research and development of intermediate range missiles. But the U.S. is not close to making any decisions about whether and how such weapons would be deployed, the official said, adding that the administration is focused on conventional, not nuclear, missiles. “We are only looking at conventional options at this time,” the official said. “Nothing the United States is currently looking at is nuclear in character.” This official also emphasized that any decisions about deployments would be made in close consultation with NATO allies. He  said Friday’s decision was not a signal that the U.S. would pivot toward an arms race with China, although he noted that China has more than 1,000 intermediate-range missiles. And in discussing the INF withdrawal decision last year, Trump National Security Adviser John Bolton noted that China was not bound by the treaty and argued that Beijing represents a growing threat to the U.S. "Exactly one country was constrained by the INF Treaty: the United States,” Bolton said while in Moscow in October . In the meantime, Bolton said, China, North Korea and Iran “are free to do whatever they want” and have made “very substantial strides” in developing intermediate-range missiles. Some experts say the administration's withdrawal from the pact also jeopardizes a second nuclear arms control agreement with Russia known as New START that expires in 2021. The Russians have asked the U.S. to begin negotiations on an extension of that agreement, but so far the Trump administration has not agreed to do that.

The US withdrawal from the Cold War agreement, which prohibits ground-based nuclear-tipped cruise missiles with ranges of 310 miles to 3,420 miles, comes after talks with Russia to save the treaty broke down.  (Photo: JIM LO SCALZO, EPA-EFE) Asked if the Trump administration was committed to extending New START, Pompeo did not answer directly. He said Trump was committed to reducing the proliferation of nuclear weapons but said, "It does no good to sign an agreement if a party is not going to comply with it." Experts say Russia is in compliance with New START, and the administration has not accused Russia of cheating on the pact. Steven Pifer, a fellow at Stanford University's Center for International Security and Cooperation, said the Trump administration's refusal to begin those complicated negotiations is worrisome and a sign it may want to see that treaty expire. "There’s a very early and an unfortunate possibility that in 2021, for the first time in five decades, you have no negotiated limits on U.S. or Russian nuclear forces," Pifer said. He said that would severely undermine global non-proliferation. The U.S. would no longer have credibility, he said, to press North Korea and other rogue states to give up their nuclear arsenals if America has abandoned its own arms-control agreements. Indeed, Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif used Friday's news to jab the U.S. as an unreliable negotiator, a theme he has hit on since Trump's decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear accord, known as the JCPOA. "Yet another withdrawal from an accord by the Trump administration; this time the #INFTreaty," Zarif tweeted. "It's not just the #JCPOA or Iran: Seems this clique is allergic to anything w/ US signature on it. Message: Any deal with US govt is not worth the ink; even treaties ratified…" JZarif: Yet another withdrawal from an accord by the Trump administration; this time the #INFTreaty .

"A Dummy's Guide to the Iran Nuclear Deal","A historical accord, or a historical mistake? Depends on whom you ask, and what they had at stake. After months of preparation, two weeks of final intensive discussions in Vienna and with eight parties involved, the final result was an agreement with five annexes. The Iran Nuclear Deal made headlines across the globe as a landmark historical agreement between extreme opponents. The deal laid out a lengthy process spanning over 15-25 years that would be supervised by an eight-member committee, including Iran, the United States of America, Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China and the European Union. In a nutshell, the agreed-upon nuclear deal aimed at limiting Iran's ability to produce a nuclear weapon, in exchange for the removal of various sanctions imposed on it internationally. However, the deal got a significant shake-up under U.S. President Donald Trump, who on May 8, 2018, announced that the U.S. would be pulling out of the deal and issuing fresh sanctions against Iran. Based on the revelations of an Iranian exile group in 2002, Iran was suspected to have nuclear facilities. Following inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) and subsequent discoveries, Iran continued to proceed with nuclear developments despite international opposition. In 2006, the United Nations imposed sanctions on Iran, which were followed by similar actions from the U.S. and the EU. Bitter confrontations then broke out between Iran and the world powers. These sanctions – primarily on Iran's oil business, weapons sales and financial transactions – had severely hurt Iran’s economy. As one of the largest producers of crude oil , prices went through a volatile period as the outcome was largely unknown. The deal was negotiated between Iran and a group of counterparts that included the US, Russia, Britain, Germany, France, China and the EU. The supporters of the nuclear deal affirm benefits, which include the best-possible guarantee from Iran that it will refrain from producing a nuclear arsenal. It was, at the time, an important step toward establishing peace in the Middle East region, particularly in the context of ISIS and the role of oil in Middle East economies . To make nuclear bombs, the uranium ore mined from earth needs enrichment to either uranium-235 or plutonium. Uranium ore mined from earth is processed via devices called centrifuges to create uranium-235. Uranium ore is processed in the nuclear reactors which transform it into plutonium. Under the deal, Tehran would reduce the number of centrifuges to 5,000 at the Natanz uranium plant – half the current number. Nationwide, the number of centrifuges would reduce from 19,000 to 6,000. The enrichment levels would be brought down to 3.7%, which was much lower than the 90% needed to make a bomb. The stockpile for the low-enrichment uranium would be capped to 300 kilograms for the next 15 years, down from the present 10,000 kilograms. All these measures served to restrict Iran's capability to make a nuclear bomb and would ensure nuclear power usage is limited to civilian use only. As the deal was finalized, a UN Security Council resolution was agreed upon. By August 15, 2015, Iran would submit written responses to the questions raised by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), about its nuclear program and developments. Additionally, it allowed monitoring of its facilities by IAEA inspectors on or before October 15, 2015. First, the oil embargo that prevented the import of oil from Iran was removed, which was not without its effects. The U.S. and EU lifted oil and trade-related sanctions. Foreign companies began to purchase oil from Iran, US companies located outside the U.S. were authorized to trade with Iran, and imports of selected items from Iran were permitted, which had a particular effect on international business . Simultaneously, sanctions on Iran’s banking and financial systems were dropped. It enabled the immediate release of around $100 billion currently lying frozen in Iranian bank accounts overseas. Immediately after the announcement, government officials from major European countries began visits to Iran to explore business opportunities. Some of the main challenges faced by Iran during the sanction period were Iran's shrinking GDP , high inflation (between 50% to 70% in 2013), and the nation being cut-off from world economic systems. All such economic challenges drastically improved after the agreement. Lifting sanctions would allow the movement of huge supplies of oil from Iran, which was thought to be sitting on large stockpiles due to years of imposed sanctions. International oil companies like France’s Total and Norway’s Statoil operated in Iran for years before sanctions were imposed, changing the tide for those countries and other top oil producers in the world. European car manufacturers like Peugeot and Volkswagen were market leaders in Iran prior to the sanctions. Although a few sectors like auto, oil, and infrastructure had significant interest from foreign companies in the pre-sanction era, the reality was that foreign businesses had limited presence in Iran since the 1979 Revolution. In essence, the Iranian markets had remained largely unexplored by international businesses across many other industry sectors. Former U.S. President Barack Obama claimed that the deal would make the U.S. and the world a safer place. However, concerns remained. Challenges included administrating and monitoring the atomic facilities and developments in Iran. Complete awareness was required about the existing labs, establishments, underground sites, research centers, and military bases associated with nuclear developments. Though Iran agreed to provide the IAEA higher levels of information and deeper levels of access to all nuclear programs and facilities in the country, the picture remained murky. The deal, although welcomed by a larger group of nations across the globe, also had opposition from a few prominent world leaders. Israeli leader Netanyahu said the deal "paves Iran's path to the bomb." His vehement opposition to the deal came on the basis of Iran’s history of being a nuclear-capable challenge for the Middle East region. Additionally, Netanyahu said the deal was a platform to fund and nurture a nuclear-capable, religious-extremist country, saying a strengthened Iran could hinder peace and security in the region. After the election of President Trump in November 2016, proponents of the deal feared the agreement, which they saw as a win for world peace, would be back on the table. And in October 2017, their fears were confirmed. Trump announced that he would decertify the deal. What did this mean? Under the terms, the U.S. President was required to sign off on the deal every 90 days, which he announced he would not do, accusing Iran of sponsoring terrorism. Trump has also said that he would deny Iran "all paths to a nuclear weapon." Not surprisingly, Trump's decision was met with instant condemnation. The European Union foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, was the first to weigh in saying the deal was "robust" and said there had been "no violations of any of the commitments in the agreement." After Trump's decision, Congress had 60 days from that time to reinforce sanctions, and given the hostility within the Republican party, an agreement to reinstate appeared possible. The pros and cons of such a landmark deal were and will continue to be debated. Most views, claims, and allegations are often politically tuned. For now, the majority across the globe appears to be positive about the Iran nuclear deal. However, after President Trump decertified the agreement the future became murkier.

			});  Richard Falk: The carefully negotiated agreement with Iran on its nuclear program in 2015—formally known as the JCPOA, Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, and informally as the P5+1 nuclear agreement with Iran—was undoubtedly the greatest foreign-policy accomplishment of the Obama presidency. It was achieved despite fierce and unscrupulous domestic opposition orchestrated by the unabashedly pro-Israel Congress, which did all it could to stop the deal from happening, while Black Cube, the private Israeli intelligence firm, was doing its best to block the process by resorting to its bag of dirty tricks.   It should be obvious that the core of the agreement was incredibly favorable to the West, as well as of great benefit to its regional and global nonproliferation goals.    The agreement’s central bargain was an exchange of strict controls on Iran’s nuclear program for phased sanctions relief that was conditional on verification by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that Iran was in full compliance with the agreement. To begin with, it should be obvious that the core of the agreement was incredibly favorable to the West, as well as of great benefit to its regional and global nonproliferation goals. P5+1 was, in some sense, a terrible deal—but not as Trump meant it. Rather, as the Iranian hard-line critics contended. The US government agreed to soften its harsh sanctions program by stage. The sanctions regime was itself questionable, a prime instance of dubious reliance on coercive diplomacy and double standards, given the silence about Israel’s nuclear-weapons capability. Iran’s willingness to accept the most intrusive international inspection commitments ever undertaken was a calculated risk, seeking normalization, which has now resulted in disappointment and betrayal. In other words, Iran accepted major encroachments on the normal scope of its sovereign rights so as to obtain promised relief from sanctions that had caused economic austerity in Iran and considerable suffering by the Iranian people. From a political viewpoint all major states—except, of course, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and US—agree that JCPOA was a huge victory for moderates in Iran when signed, and a severe setback for Iranian hard-liners, who had a far better case for their opposition to its terms than did the pro-Israel forces in 2014–15 and far better than does Trump now. It is notable that Trump’s repeated denunciations of the agreement as “a disaster” and “the worst deal ever negotiated” were never backed up by evidence—there was none—or even by specific allegations, except for the irrelevant charges that Iran was doing political things in the region that Washington opposed, although the United States was doing similar things on a far larger scale.  Iran committed itself in the agreement to a permanent and unconditional renunciation of any acquisition of nuclear weapons at any time. Beyond this, Iran agreed to drastically reduce its stockpile of enriched uranium, by 98 percent; to fundamentally redesign its Arak reactor so that it is no longer capable of producing plutonium; to restrict uranium enrichment to 3.67 percent, when what was necessary to achieve weapons-grade uranium requires 90 percent enrichment; and to reduce the number of centrifuges well below the level needed to amass a sufficient amount of enriched uranium to enable the manufacture of nuclear weapons. Additionally, all phases of the nuclear fuel cycle in Iran became subject to periodic inspections to verify compliance, and the IAEA had broad rights under the agreement to inspect any facility about which it had suspicions. The IAEA has issued 11 reports since the beginning of 2016, when the nuclear agreement went into effect, all indicating compliance. The head of the IAEA, Yukiya Amano, reaffirmed Iranian compliance on May 9 in a carefully worded statement: “Iran is subject to the world’s most robust nuclear verification regime under the JCPOA, which is a significant verification gain.… As of today, the IAEA can confirm that the nuclear-related commitments are being implemented by Iran.” As Susan Rice, Obama’s national security adviser, pointed out , the agreement is about verification, not trust.

			}  Under these circumstances, to withdraw from the agreement and repudiate it by this unilateral move is to undermine the reliability of multilateral diplomacy, compromise the peaceful resolution of disputes, and further erode the authority of international law. This harm to world order is further aggravated by the widespread perception that there were no reasonable grounds for withdrawing, especially given the opposition of other signatories to the Trump repudiation, including by America’s closest allies, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany.   It should be remembered that Iran accepted these unprecedented restrictions on its nuclear program while Israel continues to upgrade the quality of its nuclear weapons arsenal while striking a menacing posture toward Iran.    To break this agreement under these circumstances is shocking and dangerous. It should be remembered that Iran accepted these unprecedented restrictions on its nuclear program while Israel—with no restrictions or even significant international objections—continues to upgrade the quality of its nuclear-weapons arsenal while striking a menacing posture toward Iran. [Washington is doing the same, as noted in this May 14 New York Times article , headlined “As U.S. Demands Nuclear Disarmament, It Moves to Expand Its Own Arsenal.”] Israel makes thinly veiled threats to attack Iran militarily, threats given added credibility recently when Israel launched major military operations at Iran’s military presence in Syria—which incidentally is lawful, as it lends assistance to the legitimate government of the country faced with an insurgent opposition aided by foreign interventions. In both instances, Israel’s behavior involving threats and uses of force are flagrant violations of the key UN Charter prohibition. Recourse to international force is prohibited except in situations of self-defense against a prior armed attack. See Articles 2(4) and 51 of the Charter. DF:  Motoko Rich recently wrote that in announcing the US exit from the Iran nuclear accord, President Trump wanted to “send a signal” about another “hard bargain,” with North Korea. The author was critical of Trump. This clearly isn’t, however, the point of the exit, correct? Noam Chomsky recently indicated to me that the authors of the exit may not even believe in the pretext, and that Trump is on a mission to undo anything set forth by his predecessor to maintain a connection with his base.  RF: As is Trump’s style, his diplomatic moves are undertaken without any clearly articulated rationale that discloses his real reasons for acting so irresponsibly. It is always necessary to probe the real meaning behind the inflammatory language. The Korean dimension could have had some secondary relevance in this context, demonstrating that the United States would, whenever expedient, ignore prudence if it helps to impose its will on a weaker opponent if it resisted a proposed arrangement; but maybe not, given the great differences between North Korea, as a nuclear-weapons state, and Iran, as a non-nuclear state. Perhaps, we can say, as in the instances of Iraq and Libya, that they were attacked because they didn’t have nuclear weapons, and that Iran is under threat precisely because it lacks such a nuclear deterrent.     var inline_cta_text_281734            = '';

			}    It seems evident that Trump’s primary motivations had to do with Middle Eastern politics, and especially the relevance of Israel’s and Saudi Arabia’s undisguised resolve to achieve regime change in Tehran.    On the surface it seems evident that Trump’s primary motivations had to do with Middle Eastern politics, and especially the relevance of Israel’s and Saudi Arabia’s undisguised resolve to achieve regime change in Tehran. As with Trump’s internationally condemned decision, announced last December, to move the American embassy to Jerusalem, the geopolitical motives of withdrawal from the agreement are obscure, and likely ill-conceived, but the domestic and transnational incentives are clear—pleasing major Zionist donors to the Trump campaign, Sheldon Adelson, Bernard Marcus, and Paul Singer, and further cementing transnational solidarity with [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu and [Saudi Crown Prince] Mohammed bin Salman. This is not idle speculation. Several Washington insiders have reliably confirmed these sources of influence on the Trump decision. There are other factors present. Repudiating the agreement with Iran is one more example of Trump’s deliberate assault on multilateralism—compare this to his withdrawal from the Paris climate-change agreement and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and his hostility to the UN and NAFTA. It seems to be Trump’s way of fulfilling his campaign pledge of “America First,” as if that were not the approach of the pre-Trump leaders who occupied the White House. What Trump evidently meant was that putting America first required ending international entanglements that weakened the ability of the United States to get the best of others in diplomatic settings. It is sometimes explained as a shift to “a transactional approach,” in which the United States uses its leverage and power to the fullest, without taking into account law, morality, and the sentiments of allies.    /*

		}  [Chomsky is correct in that] Trump seems obsessed with undoing the positive achievements of the Obama presidency across the board, from health care and empathy toward undocumented immigrants to environmental protection and foreign policy. In this sense, the P5+1 agreement must have seemed an irresistible target, enabling Trump to undermine, simultaneously, multilateralism and the Obama legacy, and as a side benefit to receive praise from Israel and Saudi Arabia. Whereas Obama sought—usually vainly—bipartisan support for domestic initiatives and mobilized international support—usually effectively—for global policy undertakings, Trump’s bluster, bullying, and bluffing represent a dysfunctional, if not toxic, combination of unilateralism and neo-isolationism.  Related Article         Donald Trump Is Driving Us on a Road to Hell in the Middle East  Michael T. Klare    DF:  Robert Kelly, a political-science professor at Pusan National University in South Korea, remarked that “only a fool would trust the US to keep its word in a rogue state nuke deal now.” This sounds basically correct, no?  RF: I am not sure about this. It depends on whether leaders around the world see Trump as representing the true nature of American diplomacy or as a temporary anomaly to be soon superseded by a return to more dependable and familiar patterns of American leadership in world affairs. In the immediate future, the United States as a partner to international arrangements is certainly unreliable and untrustworthy, but worse, recklessly irresponsible, putting the country and Middle East on a path leading to an unpredictable war with likely catastrophic consequences for the countries involved and for a region already long victimized by intervention, chaos, and oppression. DF:  How is the state of Israel connected to the exit, and what do you think is at stake for Netanyahu?  RF: In important respects, the US exit is more about Israel than the terms of the agreement. It is important to keep in mind that the Trump presidency does not even bother to charge Iran with noncompliance or point to specific failures of coverage in the text of the agreement. Instead, it heeds Netanyahu’s warmongering efforts to discredit the agreement by reference to allegations of Iranian cheating that go back before the agreement was signed and were never persuasive, except now, belatedly, to the Trump White House, and to advisers like John Bolton and Mike Pompeo, who have never been shy about their desire to confront Iran militarily with the objective of replacing the present government. It is hardly coincidental that Israel launched its biggest attack on the Iranian presence in Syria less than 24 hours after Trump’s formal announcement, as if awaiting a signal. That followed the visit of Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman to Washington a few weeks ago, featuring meetings with James Mattis, his American counterpart. When Lieberman returned home he let it be known that Israel could do whatever it wished in the region, especially in Syria and Iran, and still feel confident of receiving American diplomatic and, if necessary, military support. And of course the domestic pressures from a passionately pro-Israel Congress—reinforced by the AIPAC super-lobby and, further, the billionaire donors—create for Trump a win-win at home that seems to count more for this White House than the lose-lose with respect to national interests, alliance relations, and global diplomatic reputation. In light of these developments, it would be useful for all of us to reread the Mearsheimer/Walt critical assessment of the distorting impacts of the Israel lobby on the rational pursuit of American interests in the Middle East. While the lobby was virulent and powerful when their book was published, and of course attacked, back then the pro-Israel bias was at least somewhat subtler.     var inline_cta_2_text_281734            = '';

			}  DF:  Stephen Zunes pointed out that “Trump’s strategy appears to encourage the Iranians to resume their nuclear program in order to provoke a crisis that would give the United States an excuse to go to war.” This sounds plausible but very frightening. Can you talk about the likely outcome? Is it this bleak?  RF: I think this line of thinking is plausible, although it posits that Iran will react almost as mindlessly as Trump. Much depends on how the internal tensions in Iran play out, and whether this Trump roadblock undermines President Hassan Rouhani’s determined effort to push Iran toward moderation at home and normalization abroad. The Iranian response will become clearer when and if the supreme guide, Ayatollah Khamenei, takes a policy stand that goes beyond his angry statement in reaction to the Trump withdrawal. So far, Iran seems to be sensibly following a course of seeking to weaken the impact of the US decision to reimpose sanctions by appealing for compensatory relief to China, Russia, France, the UK, and Germany, all of whom have reaffirmed their commitment to maintain the P5+1 approach. If Israel’s provocations continue, and an Iranian retaliation follows, then both regional war and a resumed unshackled Iranian nuclear program are highly likely. This would mean an expanded war zone and a likely nuclear-arms race involving all the major states in the Middle East. At least, so far, the United States has not fanned the flames further by invoking the so-called “snapback provision” in the agreement, which allows any of the six state parties to demand the reinstatement of UN sanctions, which were very burdensome in the period from 2006 to 2013, and are credited in the West with bringing Iran to the negotiating table. After the agreement was reached and UN sanctions suspended, the effect was to enhance greatly the stature and popularity of Rouhani’s moderate line within Iran. DF:  The nuclear agreement with Iran has been called a “one-sided deal” by the Trump administration. Some in Iran might agree with that, but for different reasons. Can you talk about how the United States has undermined the agreement almost from the start?  RF: As indicated earlier, the terms of the agreement are certainly one-sided, but mainly by promoting the nonproliferation priorities of the West. What most provoked critics about the terms of the deal was that it did not purport to regulate Iran’s political activities in the region: its support for Damascus in the Syrian civil war, its close ties with Hezbollah, its help to the Houthis in the Yemen war, and its positive relations with Hamas. As almost anyone would agree, this was not part of an understanding about Iran’s nuclear program, and Iran’s diplomacy is a far tamer version of what the United States, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and others have been doing for many years in the Middle East. There is also an evident American frustration with its prolonged effort to reverse the outcome of the Iranian Revolution ever since Washington’s support for Iraq in its 1980s war with Iran ended surprisingly in a defensive victory for Iran. The persisting covert operations to destabilize the governing process in Tehran, including the assassination of Iranian nuclear scientists and the insertion of a virus in Iran’s centrifuges, did not achieve any changes in Iranian policy. And most of all, the American war of aggression against Iraq in 2003, undertaken to put an iron wall around Iran, resulted in an outcome directly opposite to what was anticipated, a leadership that was more responsive to Tehran than to Washington.  Nothing has better demonstrated the failure of American leadership to understand Iran and the region generally than these failed policies of confrontation with Iran over the course of decades. Trump has brought that failure into the open by the crude escalation of tensions and by his mindless display of coercive diplomacy, which has struck a far bigger blow against American credibility as a global leader than it has against the legitimacy and viability of the Iranian government. It is necessary to observe the unfolding of events in the weeks and months ahead, but nothing more persuasively demonstrates the blunder of repudiating the P5+1 approach than the fact that the best that can be hoped for by rational commentators is that the effects of withdrawal will be somehow neutralized by the ineffectiveness of restored sanctions and the energetic efforts of the five governments that remain committed to keeping the agreement alive. If the agreement can be made to work in spite of this obstructive behavior of the United States, it may ironically be viewed in retrospect as the start of a new muscular phase of multipolar geopolitics. This would imply a decisive weakening of the hegemonic US role, with reverberations far beyond Iran, the Middle East, and the nuclear-nonproliferation regime. If developments unfold in roughly this manner, it could also produce a costly blowback to Trump’s presidency, which is already the least popular since the end of World War II.

"Key European allies vow to uphold Iran nuclear deal after Trump reneges","Key European allies expressed grave concerns over President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw the U.S. from the Iran nuclear agreement on Tuesday, vowing to continue the work of limiting Iran's nuclear program while urging the U.S. not to jeopardize gains already made under the deal. In a joint statement issued after Trump's announcement, French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Theresa May and German Chancellor Angela Merkel implored Iran "to show restraint" following the decision and called on the U.S. "to do everything possible to preserve the gains for nuclear nonproliferation brought about by the JCPOA, by allowing for a continued enforcement of its main elements." Macron also tweeted that the three countries, America and Iran's partners in the JCPOA, or Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, "regret" the U.S. decision, adding that the nations would "work collectively on a broader framework" moving forward. Trump announced his decision to leave the JCPOA Tuesday afternoon, reneging on the landmark Obama-era accord, which also includes Russia and China, and raising the question of whether Tehran might respond by resuming its frozen weapons program. Trump also said that he would impose the "highest level" of economic sanctions, which would affect not only Iran but other countries that do business with it. In 2015, Iran agreed to halt its pursuit of nuclear weapons — and to allow international checks on its facilities — in exchange for moves by the U.S., several other countries and the United Nations to roll back sanctions that had crippled its economy. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, in a televised speech, said though America's withdrawal amounted to "psychological warfare," it would continue its talks with the remaining parties to the deal. "We've known for months that President Trump wouldn't be committed to this deal," Rouhani said. "The Iranian foreign ministry will continue talks with remaining countries in the deal." "I want to emphasize that people should not have any worries about the future of this country," he added. "The people are more united than ever, and there will be peace and stability in Iran." Syrian state media also reported that the country is standing behind Iran and condemned Trump's withdrawal, saying it "proved the U.S. is not committed to international agreements." Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has been a consistent critic of the deal, cheered Trump's decision, saying the agreement did not block Iran's path to a nuclear bomb and the current framework of the deal was a "recipe for disaster." "The deal didn't push war further away, it actually brought it closer. The deal didn't reduce Iran's aggression, it dramatically increased it," he said at a news conference Tuesday. "This is why Israel thinks that President Trump did a historic move, and this is why Israel thanks President Trump for his courageous leadership." Prince Khalid bin Salman, the Saudi ambassador to the U.S., also tweeted his support of Trump's actions, saying that the country "always had reservations" about the agreement. The United Arab Emirates' minister of state for foreign affairs, Anwar Gargash, also hailed the U.S. decision and called the agreement a "flawed deal." "The veneer of Tehran’s compliance contradicted its bellicose policies," he said in a tweet. "President Trump’s decision is the correct one." © 2019 NBC UNIVERSAL","https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/key-european-allies-vow-uphold-iran-nuclear-deal-after-trump-n872441"
"Two Nuclear Deals, Two Countries, Three Decades Apart","Does the failed nuclear agreement with North Korea have lessons for the Iran deal? President Trump is expected this week to decline to certify that Iran is in compliance with the nuclear deal formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. The deal’s supporters have warned that such a move could eventually prompt Iran to abandon the multilateral agreement and continue work on its nuclear program, which was frozen under the pact. The U.S. has been in a similar spot before: In 1994, the Clinton administration signed the U.S.-North Korean Agreed Framework, under which Pyongyang agreed to freeze its nuclear program. The Bush administration withdrew from the deal after accusing North Korea of cheating on its obligations. After that, North Korea restarted a nuclear-weapons program that, according to various estimates, has now yielded between 20 and 60 bombs; the country is close to fitting a miniaturized nuclear warhead onto an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the contiguous United States. The ultimate failure of the Agreed Framework is cited by both critics and supporters of the Iran deal to bolster their case for why the U.S. should leave, or remain in, the JCPOA. Critics of the JCPOA say it is as flawed a deal as the Agreed Framework, and that neither Iran nor North Korea can be trusted to keep its word. Supporters of the Iran deal concede it is flawed but argue that in the short term it achieves its objective of freezing Iran’s nuclear program. According to this line of argument, moreover, maintaining the Agreed Framework with North Korea would have left Pyongyang with much less advanced weapons capabilities today—and conversely, the Trump administration’s approach to the JCPOA could persuade Iran to follow the blueprint laid out by North Korea. On the face of it, the two agreements have much in common. Each focused exclusively on the nuclear activities of a country whose other problematic behavior was not part of the deal. They froze the programs in exchange for economic and other incentives. And, says William Perry, the Clinton-era defense secretary who is now an advocate for nuclear disarmament and who helped negotiate the Agreed Framework, both agreements were “designed to head off a future nuclear catastrophe.” “They both were agreements designed to head off [North Korea and Iran] … from building a nuclear weapon, which we believed would cause enormous difficulties for the United States,” Perry told me, adding: “If we keep them from doing that, this is a way of heading off that difficulty.” But there are significant differences as well. For one, the Agreed Framework was a bilateral agreement between the U.S. and North Korea. The JCPOA is a multilateral agreement that also involves China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, Germany, and the European Union. (The other signatories, including Iran, say they will remain in the deal and are urging the U.S. to stay.) Second, as Richard Nephew, a senior research scholar at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University, and Newell Highsmith, a former State Department official, wrote in April for the Brookings Institution, Iran is not North Korea. It doesn’t have nuclear weapons. At the time the Agreed Framework was concluded, North Korea was believed to possess enough plutonium for at least one bomb. Tehran, Nephew and Highsmith argued, has greater incentive to cooperate with the JCPOA because it “is not the isolated ... country that North Korea is. Iran’s economy needs markets for oil exports, and depends on imports of commercial and industrial goods.” The JCPOA is also a much more comprehensive deal than the Agreed Framework, with more intense monitoring mechanisms to ensure compliance, and clear consequences , in the form of renewed sanctions, for cheating. Additionally, under the JCPOA, Iran agreed to indefinite compliance with the additional protocol of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, a move that opens up even its military facilities for international inspection. The Agreed Framework did not have such safeguards in place, which can partly explain why its critics call it a failure (though nonproliferation experts such as Jeffrey Lewis make a strong argument for why that’s not the case). Ultimately, the U.S. withdrew from the Agreed Framework citing instances of North Korean cheating—though the U.S. also failed to fulfill some terms of the deal before withdrawing. U.S. partners in the JCPOA argue that while Iran’s regional activities are a problem, Tehran’s compliance with the agreement has been verified multiple times by rigorous international inspections. As Perry put it, if Trump takes the first step to pull out of the JCPOA, “quite aside from the international diplomatic problem of having the United States make an international agreement in good faith and then, without any apparent reason, back out of it a year or two later … the second problem is [that] … as we pull out of it, it allows … Iran [to] go ahead with a nuclear program.” He added: “Every agreement doesn't cover all problems we have. … Because we cannot solve all problems doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try to solve some problems. Of the problems we have with Iran, in my judgment, the nuclear problem is the most serious.” That’s also true of North Korea today. The Trump administration—if not the president—is hoping to persuade Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear and missile programs through diplomacy. Defenders of the Iran deal point out that taking a step that could ultimately spell the JCPOA’s demise would send a bad signal to North Korea: that the U.S. cannot be trusted to keep its word. But Perry, who negotiated closely with his North Korean counterparts in the 1990s, said he wasn’t persuaded by that argument because “North Korea in many ways is an enigma.” “I think they are careful observers of what's going on in other countries, for sure,” he said. “But I do believe they have a different calculus for how they make their diplomatic decisions, which may or may not involve their reflection on what’s happening with other agreements.” We want to hear what you think about this article.

"Iran’s president fires back at Trump on nuclear deal","ISTANBUL — Iranian President Hassan Rouhani blasted the Trump administration Friday for moving "unilaterally" against the 2015 nuclear deal, denouncing the new U.S. policy but stopping short of announcing a withdrawal from the pact. "We will continue to stick to the deal and to cooperate with the [International Atomic Energy Agency] within the framework of international law," he said, referring to the watchdog tasked with monitoring Iran's nuclear program. But if the deal's other signatories "refuse to abide by their commitments, Iran will not hesitate" to respond, he said. Rouhani's remarks came just hours after Trump announced his intention to "decertify" the deal in a report to Congress. The agreement, which was negotiated under the Obama administration, curbed Iran's nuclear activities in exchange for major sanctions relief. Trump hopes congressional leaders will ramp up pressure on Iran by legislating new restrictions on some of the deal's provisions. Iran, Trump said, is "under the control of a fanatical regime." In his address, which was carried live on state television, Rouhani fired back , saying that the United States is "more isolated than ever." "The speech tonight showed that the [nuclear deal] is much stronger than what this gentleman thought during the presidential campaign," he said, referring to Trump. Rouhani, a moderate leader who has pushed for Iran to open up to the world, was reelected for a second term in May. "This is an international, multilateral deal," Rouhani said of the agreement, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA. "It is not a document between Iran and the United States that he can treat the way that he likes." In his policy speech Friday , Trump referred to Iran as a "dictatorship" with a "long campaign of bloodshed." "The regime remains the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism," he said, adding that he would order the Treasury Department to designate Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps a supporter of terrorism. The Revolutionary Guard is an official branch of Iran's armed forces, although it commands proxy forces in the region and wields vast political and economic influence. Trump's move, using an existing executive order on terrorism financing, falls short of the Foreign Terrorist Organization designation used by the State Department, which carries much harsher sanctions. Still, the designation could have far-reaching consequences, both in Iran and the region. The Revolutionary Guard, which maintains land, sea and air forces, has threatened U.S. military bases in the Persian Gulf. Iran's Foreign Ministry said Friday that designating the Revolutionary Guard a terrorist group would provoke an unspecified "crushing" response. The Revolutionary Guard "is a powerful force that is popular among the Iranian people," Rouhani said. In recent months, Rouhani sought to curb the Revolutionary Guard's role in a stagnant economy as part of a bid to woo further foreign investment. But now, Rouhani said, Iran is united in the face of foreign aggression. "You made us more united than ever," he said, addressing the United States. "You can try to separate the government and the people, but you cannot sow discord." "The Iranian nation is not a nation that will easily retreat in the face of a dictator," he said.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/iran-blasts-trumps-moves-against-nuclear-deal-revolutionary-guard/2017/10/13/f5d6c5de-aeba-11e7-9b93-b97043e57a22_story.html"
"Why does Trump ignore North Korea’s non-nuclear troublemaking?","The important stories of innovation across the continent’s wide-ranging economies In-depth coverage of the world’s largest democracy for India and its far-flung diaspora Lifestyle, culture, and living well in the new global economy Management news, advice, and ideas for business leaders Create, share, and discover charts, using the same tools as the Quartz newsroom A confidential UN report highlights North Korea’s global distribution of missile technology and chemicals weapons, including through a Syrian arms dealer and in the civil war in Yemen, according to Foreign Policy . Why does it matter? This is exactly the kind of activity by Iran that last year led US president Donald Trump to unilaterally pull out of a global non-proliferation agreement with Tehran, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) or simply the Iran nuclear deal. US intelligence officials insisted that all their evidence showed Iran abiding by the JCPOA. But Iran continues to back terrorist groups and funnel money and resources into various proxy wars in the Middle East, and continues to develop ballistic missiles it says are limited to a range of 2,000 km (1,243 miles). With a dubiously binding annex of the JCPOA calling on Iran not to develop missiles at all, the US used it as proxy to pull out. Yet in a matter of days, Trump will sit down for a second time with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un in Vietnam to talk about ending the latter’s pursuit of nuclear armaments while proclaiming they have a “great relationship.” But North Korea, as the UN document but also years of reporting and intelligence work confirm, is just as busy destabilizing the world. Consider that North Korea continues to contribute technology and expertise to the very Iranian missile program that so upsets US officials. North Korea helped Syria develop the chemical weapons (paywall) used by Syrian strongman Bashar al-Assad. The regime’s security forces were behind the brazen assassination of Kim’s brother, Kim Jong-nam, in a Malaysian airport in 2017.  And more than Iran, North Korea is suspected in costly cyber attacks , like a digital heist of Bangladesh’s central bank in 2016 or the attacks on Sony in 2014. But on Feb. 13, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told CBS News that “North Korea behaves very differently. They’re not destabilizing Yemen. They’re not destabilizing Syria. They’re not conducting enormous assassination campaigns. These countries’ behaviors are different.” It’s hard to say that’s truly the case. Arguably, Iran is closer to being a democracy and a rule-abiding member of the international order than North Korea. But the Trump administration’s foreign policy apparently sees North Korea as worthy of honey, while Iran gets the stick. Part of the story may simply be Trump’s desire to reverse the work of the Obama administration, which inked the JCPOA with Iran but failed to achieve a diplomatic opening with North Korea. Now, Trump is bellicose toward Tehran and beatific toward Pyongyang. Trump and his staff also believe that the religion Islam is a unique threat to the United States , which colors their analysis. It’s also difficult to extract US posture towards Iran from regional power politics. In the Middle East, the administration values its relationships with Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the Gulf States, all Iranian rivals, more than it does a consistent approach to nonproliferation or human rights. But in Asia, South Korea and China favor a diplomatic approach to North Korea, while Japan has taken a back seat in recent talks. The problem with this inconsistent approach is that these talks are not taking place in a vacuum. Potential nuclear states keeping a wary eye on the US may deduce that their only protection is to develop nuclear weapons as fast as possible: Nuclear-armed Kim Jong Un is feted by the US while mere aspirants like the Ayatollah are sanctioned, and those without nuclear weapons—Libya’s Muammar Gaddafi and Iraq’s Saddam Hussein—are dead. This is not an incentive that arms control experts think is helpful . And given the lack of any framework for a deal prepared before the summit—recall the years of complex negotiations that led to the JCPOA—few are expecting a concrete denuclearization deal to emerge from next week’s meeting between the two leaders. Given the danger of North Korea , they just hope it won’t get any worse .","https://qz.com/1558132/trumps-risky-nuclear-double-standard-on-north-korea-and-iran/"
"Iran lists demands for staying in nuclear deal","Officials say EU must present credible package by end of May to compensate for US sanctions  Patrick Wintour Diplomatic editor  Fri 25 May 2018 06.39 EDT   Last modified on Tue 7 Aug 2018 10.33 EDT   Iran has said it will decide in the next few weeks whether to pull out of the nuclear deal signed in 2015 and start enriching uranium capable of making a nuclear bomb. The announcement was made by Tehran as its officials met counterparts from France, Britain, Germany Russian and China in Vienna on Friday to assess how the deal can be kept alive in the face of the reimposition by the US of secondary sanctions designed to cripple any European firm continuing to do business with Iran. President Trump withdrew from the deal despite strenuous European objections on 8 May, adding that old sanctions against contact with the Tehran regime would be reimposed. In the run-up to the Vienna meeting, Tehran officials said the EU would need to present a credible compensation package by the end of the month to make up for the loss of income to Iran caused by the US sanctions. Afterwards, Iran’s deputy foreign minister Abbas Araqchi said he was more confident than before that the deal could survive. “For the time being we are negotiating... to see if they can provide us with a package which can actually give Iran the benefits of sanctions-lifting and then the next step is to find guarantees for that package and we need both legal and political commitments by the remaining participants in the JCPOA [deal],” he said. In July 2015, Iran and a six-nation negotiating group reached a landmark agreement known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action that ended a 12-year deadlock over Tehran’s nuclear programme. The deal, struck in Vienna after nearly two years of intensive talks, limited the Iranian programme, to reassure the rest of the world that it cannot develop nuclear weapons, in return for sanctions relief. At its core, the JCPOA is a straightforward bargain: Iran’s acceptance of strict limits on its nuclear programme in return for an escape from the sanctions that grew up around its economy over a decade prior to the accord. Under the deal, Iran unplugged two-thirds of its centrifuges, shipped out 98% of its enriched uranium and filled its plutonium production reactor with concrete. Tehran also accepted extensive monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which has verified 10 times since the agreement, and as recently as February, that Tehran has complied with its terms. In return, all nuclear-related sanctions were lifted in January 2016 , reconnecting Iran to global markets. The six major powers involved in the nuclear talks with Iran were in a group known as the P5+1: the UN security council’s five permanent members – China, France, Russia, the UK and the US – and Germany. The nuclear deal is also enshrined in a UN security council resolution that incorporated it into international law. The 15 members of the council at the time unanimously endorsed the agreement. Iran is increasingly sceptical that Europe has the means or will to set up an economic firewall that can assure European firms that they will be protected from US Treasury fines if they do business in Iran. Many of the firms trading with Iran, such as the French oil company Total, have substantial US interests and do not want to put those assets at risk to continue trading with Iran. The Vienna meeting being held in the joint commission format was the first such conference without the US, and was in some ways a test of Europe’s commercial and diplomatic ability to follow a foreign policy independent of Washington. Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei this week said his country would stay in the deal on three strict conditions. He said the EU had to protect Iranian oil sales from US sanctions and continued to buy Iranian oil. He also demanded European banks safeguard trade with Iran, including by keeping the country inside the Swift international payments system. Finally, he also urged France, Germany and the UK not to seek a new agreement on Iran’s ballistic missile programme, or its regional activities, including its presence in Yemen, Iraq and Syria. Broadly, Russia and China agree with these terms. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, on Monday outlined a counter set of demands before the country would rejoin the deal that the EU rejected as unrealistic and amounting to regime change in Tehran. The EU fears ever heavier economic sanctions will strengthen hardliners in Tehran, while the US believes a country-wide rebellion can be stoked among a population angry at the regime’s costly overseas military adventures. Speaking in St Petersburg, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, said the US approach to the deal was “not serious”, adding he was comforted by a report from the International Atomic Energy Agency confirming Iran was still abiding by the deal’s key restrictions on its nuclear facilities. He also said companies from France and other European countries should be given an opportunity to “keep their economic profit, despite the US sanctions, and maintain their economic presence in Iran”. Macron added: “Europe should have a stronger economic sovereignty. France envisages a compensation for French companies acting within the framework of treaties signed by France.” The EU is studying three plans to protect trade with Iran – a legally untested blocking statute that renders any US sanctions on EU companies null and void, euro-denominated finance for companies from the European Investment Bank, and an EU equivalent to the US Treasury’s secondary sanctions regime. Macron also said he wanted Iran to complete the nuclear deal by signing a new framework agreement to cover ballistic missiles and its regional activities. He revealed he had spoken to Tehran on the need to agree on what follows the end of the agreement in 2025. It is not clear what the EU will do if Iran pushes back on this plan. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, counselled against anything that resembled reopening the deal, and warned of the lamentable consequences if the deal collapsed. There is intense anger in some European capitals, notably Paris, at the unilateral tone of the US approach, especially the reimposition of sanctions. The premise of the nuclear deal – officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action was to let Iran rejoin the global economy in exchange for denuclearisation. The only EU country so far to support the US withdrawal from the deal is Poland. The most effective weapon in the US economic armoury is to slash Iranian oil exports by isolating Iran’s central bank from the global banking system. About 37% of Iran’s oil exports go to European destinations, and overall the EU is Iran’s number one trading partner. The value of trade between the EU and Iran soared from $9.2bn (£6.9bn) in 2015 to $25bn in 2017.","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/25/iran-lists-demands-nuclear-deal-eu-us-sanctions"
"Secrecy News","The US is no longer complying with the Iran nuclear deal and is poised to re-impose some previously lifted sanctions on Iran and its trading partners. But the legal basis for that action is a bit murky and contested.

"Trump pulls United States out of Iran nuclear deal, calling the pact ‘an embarrassment’","President Trump on Tuesday said he is pulling the United States out of the international nuclear deal with Iran, announcing that economic sanctions against Tehran will be reinstated and declaring that the 2015 pact was rooted in “fiction.” Trump’s decision , announced at the White House, makes good on a campaign pledge to undo an accord he has criticized as weak , poorly negotiated and “insane.” “The Iran deal is defective at its core. If we do nothing, we know exactly what will happen,” Trump said in remarks at the White House . “In just a short period of time, the world’s leading state sponsor of terror will be on the cusp of acquiring the world’s most dangerous weapons.” The move amounts to Trump’s most significant foreign policy decision to date. While he cast the U.S. action as essential for national security and a warning to Iran and any other nuclear aspirant that “the United States no longer makes empty threats,” it could also increase tensions with key U.S. allies that heavily lobbied the administration in recent weeks not to abandon the pact and see it as key to keeping peace in the region. They tried to convince Trump that his concerns about “flaws” in the accord could be addressed without violating its terms or ending it altogether. After Trump’s announcement, the leaders of Britain, France and Germany issued a joint statement expressing “regret and concern” and pledging their “continuing commitment” to terms of the agreement, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). “This resolution remains the binding international legal framework for the resolution of the dispute about the Iranian nuclear programme,” British Prime Minister Theresa May, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel said in their statement. “We urge all sides to remain committed to its full implementation and to act in a spirit of responsibility.” That was a plea to Iran not to take steps that would break the deal , something Iranian officials have said at times they would do if Trump followed through on his frequent threats to yank the United States out of the agreement. While the U.S. exit does not render the rest of the deal moot, it is not clear whether there is enough incentive on the part of Iran to sustain the agreement. Relief from U.S. banking sanctions was a main reason for Tehran to come to the table. “In response to US persistent violations & unlawful withdrawal from the nuclear deal, as instructed by President Rouhani, I’ll spearhead a diplomatic effort to examine whether remaining JCPOA participants can ensure its full benefits for Iran,” Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted. “Outcome will determine our response.” The United States will reimpose all sanctions and could add new ones, U.S. officials said. Discussions with allies about new negotiations would begin Wednesday, White House national security adviser John Bolton said . Bolton, filling in some of the blanks in Trump’s remarks, said that all U.S. nuclear-related sanctions lifted as part of the agreement are now back in effect. “We’re out of the deal. Right now. We’re out of the deal,” he said. A memorandum signed by Trump at the conclusion of his statement means that “no new contracts” with Iran will be permitted, Bolton said. Although the United States cannot prevent the Europeans or others from having financial relationships with Iran, nearly all global transactions at some point pass through dollar exchanges and U.S. banks, arrangements that are now prohibited. Existing contracts, Bolton said, will be subject to “wind-down provisions” of 90 days to six months, after which they will be required to “phase out.” Regulations giving specific time frames, he said, will be announced by the Treasury Department. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the administration was revoking licenses for Boeing and Airbus, which were among the biggest deals since the nuclear accord. Boeing had planned to sell IranAir about 80 aircraft worth about $17 billion; Airbus had agreed to sell 100 aircraft worth about $19 billion. “The Boeing and Airbus licenses will be revoked,” Mnuchin said. “The existing licenses will be revoked.” He argued that sanctions are what previously brought Iran to the negotiating table. “These are very, very strong sanctions — they worked last time,” Mnuchin told reporters. “Our objective is to, again, eliminate transactions and eliminate access to their oil industry.” Trump’s declaration puts a variety of companies in difficult positions. Though the French oil giant Total had hoped the contract it signed would be excluded from the newly reimposed sanctions, that seemed unlikely Tuesday. The U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal also boosts the outlook for crude-oil prices. Before the deal, the Obama administration squeezed traders and refiners to not buy Iranian oil, wringing a series of 20 percent cuts in purchases until more than 1 million barrels a day of Iran’s exports had been taken off world markets. Fear of a similar mechanism has been one factor bolstering oil prices in recent weeks, though prices sagged Tuesday. The price of West Texas Intermediate crude fell about 1.4 percent, slipping to $69.74 a barrel. Trump immediately faced questions about whether he has a plan for dealing with Iran beyond scrapping the accord, and the administration will now be under pressure to show that it has a strategy for the Middle East beyond undoing what was put in place under President Barack Obama. “I don’t see a path,” said Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), stressing that even if Trump had promised during the campaign to rip up and replace the Iran deal, “they don’t have a real plan here.” Obama considered the agreement a signature foreign policy accomplishment, calling it the best way to head off the near-term threat of a nuclear-armed Iran and a potential opening toward better relations with Tehran after more than three decades of enmity. Obama on Tuesday lamented Trump’s decision and sought to counter his criticism that the accord had done little to check Iran’s nuclear ambitions. “The reality is clear. The JCPOA is working — that is a view shared by our European allies, independent experts, and the current U.S. Secretary of Defense,” Obama said in a statement. “The JCPOA is in America’s interest — it has significantly rolled back Iran’s nuclear program.” Trump said Iran had lied throughout negotiations for the international deal, and he cited secret Iranian documents revealed last week by Israel that showed the Iranian regime had concealed a nuclear weapons program in the 1990s. “America will not be held hostage to nuclear blackmail. We will not allow American cities to be threatened with destruction, and we will not allow a regime that chants ‘Death to America’ to gain access to the most deadly weapons on Earth,” Trump said. The chant was a fixture of pro-government rallies in Iran for decades, but despite its use during a major anti-Trump rally last year, it has largely fallen out of favor as a propaganda tool. Trump invoked the current diplomatic efforts with North Korea and the possibility of a compact to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons as emblematic of how he is conducting major international negotiations, saying any deal he cut would be airtight. The reaction to the president’s decision did not split neatly along party lines. While some GOP leaders applauded his decision, heralding it as an opportunity to strike a new and better arrangement, several other senior Republicans — including those who voted against the Iran deal — said the decision to withdraw was “foolhardy” and “a mistake.” “The Iran Deal is a deeply flawed agreement. . . . However, without proof that Iran is in violation of the agreement, it is a mistake to fully withdraw from this deal,” Rep. Michael R. Turner (R-Ohio), a senior member of the House Armed Services and Intelligence committees, said in a statement. Even House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) said in a statement that it was “unfortunate” that the United States could not come up with a way of fixing the Iran deal instead of withdrawing, and he thanked the European parties to the pact for trying to work with Washington “toward that goal.” He expressed hope that they might be able to find a new way of addressing Iranian aggression before new sanctions are implemented. Other GOP leaders cheered the move, saying it was needed to push U.S. allies and Iran to strike a more restrictive bargain. “President Trump is right to abandon the Obama administration’s bad deal,” Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) said in a statement, adding that Congress must have a role in any new agreement. Democratic leaders excoriated the president for a “rash” and shortsighted decision that they argued will compromise security in the Middle East and around the world. “The President’s decision to abdicate American leadership during a critical moment in our effort to advance a denuclearization agreement with North Korea is particularly senseless, disturbing and dangerous,” House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said in a statement. Josh Dawsey, Seung Min Kim, Damian Paletta, Philip Rucker, John Hudson, Karoun Demirjian and Steven Mufson contributed to this report.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-will-announce-plans-to-pull-out-of-iran-nuclear-deal-despite-pleas-from-european-leaders/2018/05/08/4c148252-52ca-11e8-9c91-7dab596e8252_story.html"
"How Iran Will Determine the Nuclear Deal's Fate","ARIANE M. TABATABAI is Director of Curriculum and a Visiting Assistant Professor at Georgetown University’s Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service in the Security Studies Program and an International Security Program Fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs. When U.S. President Donald Trump announced on May 8 that he was pulling the United States out of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), commonly known as the Iran nuclear deal , many observers promptly turned their attention to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to ascertain the future of the agreement. Since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, conventional wisdom has held that decision-making power ultimately rests with the supreme leader. Hence, with every major event in Iranian public life and foreign affairs, commentators take to the pages of newspapers and magazines to predict Khamenei’s reaction, ponder the significance of his statements, decipher his comments, and determine what it all means for the fate of the country and its place in the world. More often than not, however, the supreme leader’s statements create a framework for the country’s foreign policy rather than the precise road map that it must follow. And in creating this framework, the final arbiter of Iranian affairs is supported by hundreds of staffers and advisers. Because the Islamic Republic is a notoriously opaque system, it makes sense that many Western observers often credit the two most visible power centers of the regime with making national security and foreign policy decisions: the supreme leader and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). In reality, the decision-making process is not a simple top-down exercise but the result of a complex push and pull within a web of organizations, some of which are redundant. This is because as a revolutionary state, the Islamic Republic relies on a number of coup-proofing mechanisms to safeguard the regime. Competition between these institutions and infighting within the different factions that constitute them often dominate the decision-making process. HOW TEHRAN CREATES POLICY The supreme leader’s role lies in creating the framework within which other organizations will operate. Advised by a team of staffers, he determines the redlines and bottom lines of the country’s policies, zones of possible agreement in negotiations, and acceptable and Loading, please wait...

"How We Got the Iran Deal","WENDY R. SHERMAN is Senior Counselor at Albright Stonebridge Group and a Senior Fellow at the Belfer Center at the Harvard Kennedy School. From 2011 to 2015, she served as U.S. Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs. This essay is adapted from her forthcoming book, Not for the Faint of Heart: Lessons in Courage, Power, and Persistence (PublicAffairs, 2018). Copyright © 2018 by Wendy R. Sherman. Reprinted by permission of PublicAffairs. In the international negotiations that resulted in the 2015 agreement to limit Iran’s nuclear activities , I led the team of American diplomats representing the United States. During the talks, my Iranian counterparts would occasionally ask how they could be assured that any deal we struck would be durable. Most Republicans opposed it, and looking at the forthcoming 2016 U.S. presidential election, the Iranians wondered what would happen if the GOP took the White House. I would answer by asking them a similar question: “What if hard-liners opposed to the deal regained power in Iran?” It usually ended the discussion, as I thought it should: after all, I always expected that the greatest challenge to the deal’s success would be violations by Iran, not the political machinations of the president of the United States. Of course, I was wrong. In May of this year, U.S. President Donald Trump decided to pull the United States out of the agreement and reimpose the U.S. sanctions on Iran that the deal had lifted, a move that will go down as one of the worst foreign policy blunders in U.S. history. The Iran deal was not perfect; no deal ever is. Nonetheless, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), as the agreement is formally known, offered the best possible assurance that Iran would never obtain a nuclear weapon. I don’t know if the Iran deal can survive the reinstatement of sanctions , which the United States set aside in exchange for the Iranians’ pledge to vastly reduce their uranium enrichment, produce no weapons-grade plutonium, and allow international inspectors to rigorously verify their compliance. The JCPOA’s restrictions close every possible path for Iran to obtain fissile material for a nuclear weapon. Although some of the restrictions that the deal places on Iran end after 10, 15, 20, or 25 years, its prohibition on Iran’s obtaining a nuclear weapon never ends. So far, the Iranians have stuck to the terms of the deal. Trump’s decision Loading, please wait... This site uses cookies to improve your user experience. Click here to learn more.

"Iran 'ready to discuss human rights' if EU fixes nuclear accord","Share this article Iran may be willing to put human rights discussions on the table if the European Union can successfully rebalance the 2015 nuclear accord, the head of the country's atomic energy authority has told Euronews. Ali Akbar Salehi, who is also a vice-president in the Iranian government, said in an interview at the Iranian embassy in Brussels that he had been convinced after talks with EU foreign policy supremo Federica Mogherini and other officials that European nations were doing their utmost to deliver economic benefits to his country despite the return of US sanctions. Donald Trump this year pulled out of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) under which Iran had agreed to halt activities that could contribute to a nuclear weapons programme in return for an end to an international trade embargo. He reintroduced sanctions but the other partners to the deal - the European Union, Russia and China - agreed to remain within the agreed framework. However, they have struggled to deliver meaningful benefits to Iran because of the influence of the US on global trade through the use of the dollar. "If we can save JCPOA, cooperation with the EU could be expanded. Iran can be a good complement to Europe. We can even resume human rights talk with EU," Salehi told Euronews. However, he warned that failure to deliver would have consequences. "We do not bluff. If the JCPOA breaks down and (leader) orders, we can very easily back to our situation before and even beyond that." Salehi said he had discussed a deadline with his EU counterparts but refused to reveal what it was. The EU has agreed to set up a special framework to allow it to circumvent US sanctions but individual nations have been reluctant to host the structure for fear of falling foul of the US.

"Iranian president travels to Austria in effort to salvage Iran deal","Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Wednesday that Iran would remain in a landmark nuclear deal with world powers, despite the withdrawal of the United States — but only if other countries can "guarantee Iran's interests." Rouhani's comments came as he met with top-ranking Austrian officials in Vienna, where the nuclear deal was finalized in 2015, in an effort to preserve the pact after President Trump Donald John Trump The Hill's Morning Report - White House, Congress: Urgency of now around budget  GOP presses Trump to make a deal on spending  Democrats wary of handing Trump a win on infrastructure  MORE announced in May that he would abandon it. "Iran will protect the nuclear deal if it can benefit from it," Rouhani said at a joint news conference with Austrian President Alexander Van der Bellen, according to the Iranian president's office . "But this must be balanced and if signatories other than the U.S. can guarantee Iran's interests, Iran will stay in the deal without the U.S.," he added. Rouhani and other Iranian officials, concerned about the re-implementation of U.S. sanctions, are locked in an intense effort to convince world powers to remain in the 2015 agreement — officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif is set to meet with counterparts from the five other countries in the nuclear deal — the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia and China — on Friday in a bid to save the deal, which sought to curb Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief from the U.S. and others. The pact was seen as one of former President Obama's key foreign policy achievements. But Trump had long railed against the JCPOA as a diplomatic and national security failure, because it focused on Iran's nuclear ambitions without addressing other activities, like Tehran's backing of groups deemed terrorist organizations by the U.S. Since Trump's announcement of the U.S. withdrawal in May, his administration has sought to reimpose sanctions on Iran and has encouraged other countries to do the same. The U.S. is also pressing allies to cut out Iranian oil imports entirely by Nov. 4. Trump's withdrawal from the deal, however, was widely rebuked, even by allies in Europe who see the JCPOA as the framework for curbing Iran's nuclear program. Van der Bellen stood by the deal after his meeting with Rouhani on Wednesday. "Austria and the European Union are ready to maintain and deepen the framework for cooperation with Iran," he said, according to Bloomberg News .

Hassan Rouhani, Iran's president, speaks during the UN General Assembly meeting at the United Nations on Tuesday.       Photo Credit: Bloomberg/Jeenah Moon UNITED NATIONS — Iranian President Hassan Rouhani invited President Donald Trump to renegotiate the Iran nuclear accord while criticizing his counterpart’s unilateral approach to international affairs. Rouhani, who spoke during the UN General Assembly’s General Debate a few hours after Trump singled Iran out as “the world’s leading sponsor of terrorism,” countered that the United States, at least under Trump, does not honor its agreements. “The government of the United States of America, at least the current administration, seems determined to render all international institutions ineffectual,” Rouhani said, referring to Trump’s decision last May to withdraw from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which monitored Iran’s nuclear activity. Trump had earlier in the day denounced the plan and, in furtherance of his “America First” paradigm of international relations, defended his administration’s dismissal of an international compact on migration and derided the International Criminal Court, which prosecutes war criminals. Rouhani noted that the UN Security Council had unanimously approved the Iran nuclear deal, and that the United States, in withdrawing from it last May, had violated "a paramount principle of continuity of state responsibility” because Trump had abandoned a pact hammered out by his predecessor’s administration. “On what basis and criteria can we enter into an agreement with an administration misbehaving such as this?” he said. “Any talks should be within the framework and in continuation of the JCPOA and Security Council Resolution 2231, and not in a framework of breaching them and reverting to the past.” He defended Iran’s participation in the plan, adding that the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency had endorsed Iran’s compliance on many occasions. “United Nations Security Council Resolution 2231 is not a piece of paper,” Rouhani said. “We invite you to return to that Council resolution. We invite you to come back to the negotiating table you left. If you dislike the JCPOA because it is the legacy of your domestic political rivals, then we invite you to come ack to the SC resolution . . . Do not engage in imposing sanctions.” Get the latest breaking news as it happens. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy . Trump mentioned in his speech that Iran’s leaders “sow chaos, death and destruction” and that the United States would renew the sanctions that had been lifted when the JCPOA went into force in 2015, and that new ones would kick in on Nov. 5. “Unlawful unilateral sanctions in themselves constitute a form of economic terrorism and breach of the right to development,” Rouhani said.’ ”I state here in clear, unambiguous terms that the United States policy toward the Islamic Republic of Iran has been wrong from the beginning and its approach of resisting the will of the Iranian people as manifested in numerous elections is doomed to failure.” Rouhani’s 25-minute address focused almost exclusively on responding to Trump’s critique and even defending his country’s record on fighting terrorism, though the United States has long criticized Iran as a supporter of terrorism. Iran has committed troops to the civil war in Syria in an awkward arrangement where it and the United States espouse commitment to eradicating the Islamic State, al-Qaida and other terrorist groups, but from opposite sides of the conflict. Iran supports Syria’s president, Bashar Assad, along with Russia, and the United States and Syrian opposition forces would like to see Assad’s ouster. Rouhani said Iran’s record of opposing terrorism included opposing al-Qaida before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center and Washington and had fought an eight-year war against the Baath Party of then-President Saddam Hussein in Iraq before Hussein’s force invaded Kuwait in 1990. A U.S.-led coalition of forces removed Iraqi forces from Kuwait. Rouhani said the Middle East’s most pressing problem, however, is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, adding that Israel would not have the power it has to occupy the lands were it not for the assistance of the United States. “The passage of time cannot justify occupation,” he said, also faulting Trump’s decision to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a move roundly criticized as favoring Israel over Palestine while the United States has proffered itself as a neutral broker of the decades-old conflict.

"SEC Uncertainty Looms Over Token Summit – Again","It looks like Kik won’t sue the SEC after all, founder Ted Livingston told CoinDesk. In a widely circulated story, the Waterloo, Ontario, company had promised legal action against an expected regulatory action, but the odds that Kik will pursue that seem to be diminishing, even if the company’s legal expenses are not . Nevertheless, Livingston would prefer the SEC take any action rather than continuing to delay. “What we’re saying to them is, ‘Stop dragging this out, if you want to go to court, if you think there is an infraction, then let’s go to court,’” Livingston told CoinDesk at Token Summit 2019 in New York City on Thursday. Livingston’s remarks fell in line with a major theme of the summit itself: regulatory uncertainty. The topic had also been a major theme last year and at the summit’s prior iteration in San Francisco . In fact, it has felt like the endless conversation in crypto ever since ERC-20 tokens created a new fundraising strategy: selling access to new networks, rather than ownership stakes. Jae Kwon, of Cosmos, gave a generally positive view of regulators’ efforts, though he still noted gaps. He said it made a lot of sense for regulators to tamp down an ICO market that “wasn’t sustainable.” Still, Kwon noted, “There’s a lot of innovation that’s always ahead of the regulators.” An investor in the space, Ash Egan of Accomplice VC, said this continuing conversation about what’s legal is “taking mindshare away.” He told CoinDesk: “You have to actually think about: Do you want to engage, like Blockstack is, or do you want to ignore it?” Playing by the rules is not cheap. Muneeb Ali of Blockstack took the stage to discuss his company’s Regulation A+ filing with the SEC. The Reg A+ is colloquially known as the mini-IPO and requires much of the same legal legwork. Token Summit co-host William Mougayar said on stage that he had heard Blockstack had spent as much as $2 million to finalize its filing. While declining to confirm that figure, Ali said he expected that if Blockstack got a qualification for its offering to U.S. investors, then future companies would be able to take the same approach at a lower cost. “We are considering it a donation to our industry,” Ali quipped. There are other approaches out there to dealing with regulatory uncertainty. Many members of the larger crypto community appear to support redefining the terms, offering their support for Congressmen Warren Davidson and Darren Soto and their Token Taxonomy Act , which would exempt certain cryptocurrencies from securities laws. Soto, a Florida Democrat, spoke briefly via video, urging attendees to press their own representatives to support his legislation: “As I look to the future of our economy, more and more transactions will be done through cryptocurrency.” For his part, Ali acknowledged the legislative process currently underway but said his company did not feel it could wait. He also said he couldn’t really conceive of following Kik’s approach and challenging the SEC to a courtroom showdown. Timothy Massad of the Brookings Institution didn’t seem to believe the bill had much hope anyway. He said that Soto is the exception among the House Democrats on the legislation because, he believes, most are uncomfortable with how much the bill undermines securities law. An attorney who formerly helmed the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) under President Barack Obama, Massad’s take comes from a Washington insider’s perspective. He also disagrees with the approach. “I wouldn’t agree that this industry is different, that it needs a special exemption from securities law,” he said. He conceded, however, that more clarity is needed and the present course, via enforcement actions, hasn’t been the most efficient. And that’s left a bevy of other problems. One attendee pointed to protocols that suddenly forked themselves. Massad pointed to frontrunning and exchanges with trading desks that use their own customers’ info to make trades. Massad noted: “You’ve got all sorts of problems in the cash market for things that aren’t securities.” But, on that point, another lawyer on the panel noted there are a lot more issues beyond how the law views crypto. Robert Rosenblum, an attorney at Wilson SAonsini Goodrich & Rosati, said his firm has typically seen most cryptos as securities. He said that his coworkers have always felt the gap then was, “So, now what?” In other words, regulators need to explain, if tokens are securities, how the public should buy them and where trading markets can be established. Kwon of Cosmos made a similar point. He noted that no one has any idea how to run a decentralized exchange in a way that’s OK with U.S. regulators right now. But Rosenblum seemed to feel this would and could be worked out. “Only after we have a reasonably well-functioning market, will we have more experience, and a much better framework,” Rosenblum said. How long will that take, though? And that became the underlying question. Slowness tortures a very fast-moving industry. Andreas Glarner, an attorney with European compliance firm MME, said that the view from Europe is that this entire industry is confused: “After roughly five years’ time, the answer is: It’s not clear. Otherwise, we wouldn’t be sitting here. That’s the outside view.” Attorney Nancy Wojtas, a partner at Cooley LLP, said she agreed that the doubts are spurring companies to leave or at least domicile elsewhere, and that’s a concern. Kwon concurred: “If the U.S. is not careful, it’s going to lose its ability to participate.”","https://www.coindesk.com/sec-uncertainty-looms-over-token-summit-again"
"John Bolton Keeps the Executive Order Terminating the Iran Deal Framed on His Wall","US National Security Advisor John Bolton speaks at the ‘United Against Nuclear Iran’ 2018 Summit. MANDEL NGAN/AFP/Getty Images. John Bolton’s West Wing office is sparse. But two framed decorations provide a glimpse into the mind of President Donald Trump’s hawkish national security advisor: the executive order which terminated the Iran nuclear deal, and a cartoon published in The Wall Street Journal shortly after the United States withdrew from the agreement. According to a POLITICO profile, Bolton mounted the executive order on his wall, along with the same pen Trump used to sign it. Adjacent from the decree hangs a Wall Street Journal cartoon featuring Trump and Bolton playing chess with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei—signed by the president, “John, Great Job.” Untethering the U.S. from the Obama administration’s Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (better known as the Iran nuclear deal) has to date been Bolton’s hallmark policy victory in Washington. Having called Tehran’s government “the world’s central banker for terrorism since 1979,” and having long supported regime change in the region, Bolton has fiercely adopted the White House’s “ maximum pressure ” strategy for dealing with Iran. Despite his role in drafting the framework for the executive order, Bolton acknowledged he serves only at the honor of the president. “I am the national security adviser,” Bolton told POLITICO . “I am not the national decision-maker. And the privilege of being here about to advise the president gives me and other senior advisers the latitude to tell him what we recommend he do. But, ultimately, he is the one who makes the decision… Nobody who has ever served in government at a senior level has any misunderstanding of whose views are actually going to control.” Also in Bolton’s office is a gold-framed painting of President George H. W. Bush sitting in the Oval Office with his vice president, national security advisor and secretaries of State and Defense as they discussed how to best expel Iraqi troops occupying Kuwait in 1990. The photo, according to Bolton, represents “close-knit high-level decision making” favored by Bush and his national security advisor, “and serves as a model of how he approaches his job today.” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

"Why Russia Wants the Iran Nuclear Deal (Op-ed)","As U.S. President Donald Trump prepares to withdraw from the Joint Comprehensive Plan Of Action (JCPOA) — known in Trump world as “Obama’s bad deal with Iran” — Moscow, surprisingly, has found itself on what might be called the right side of history. Other than Trump’s personal dislike for Barack Obama’s legacy, the United States does not stand to gain by walking away from the JCPOA. There is in fact no U.S. win there, only a mounting tally of international losses. For Moscow, the Trump administration’s criticism of the Iran deal is incomprehensible and pure folly. The U.S. intelligence community together with the IAEA says that Iran is complying with the terms of the deal, and since 2004 has not undertaken any work on building a nuclear weapon. This was spectacularly confirmed last week by Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when he unveiled the Israeli intelligence haul of Iran’s secret nuclear archives in a PowerPoint presentation that commentators said was itself pitched at Trump. Iran's foreign minister, Javad Zarif, responded to the presentation referring to Netanyahu as the boy who cried wolf. BREAKING: The boy who can't stop crying wolf is at it again. Undeterred by cartoon fiasco at UNGA. You can only fool some of the people so many times. pic.twitter.com/W7saODfZDK For all the theatrics, Netanyahu presented no evidence that Iran has been violating the JCPOA since 2015. Yes, Israel exposed Iranian leaders to be perennial liars for denying for years that their “peaceful nuclear energy program” was aiming to build nuclear weapons. But isn’t it what the JCPOA was negotiated for — to deny Iran a fast track to nukes with a tough inspection regime? JCPOA also does not directly address Iran’s missile program (Russia strongly objected to linking the two) but imposes an indirect prohibition on the development of nuclear weapons delivery systems, including ICBMs. There are other UN-imposed limits on Iran’s missile program until 2023. And, of course, there was never going to be an opportunity to agree within the JCPOA framework on curbs to Iran’s malign activities in the Middle East. It simply could not be the subject of negotiations, much to the disapproval of Israel, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf nations. Those add-ons would allow for punitive sanctions on Iran’s missile program and sanctioning Iran’s power projection in the region in return for the United States staying within the JCPOA. The efforts to negotiate such a deal are still continuing, but are likely to fall short with time running out and the United States insisting on phasing out the JCPOA provisions. Moscow realizes that the Trump administration is likely to shoot itself in the foot and isolate the U.S. internationally were Trump to walk away from the JCPOA. From Moscow’s perspective, this is a silver lining. It weakens the U.S. position in the run-up to a highly anticipated Trump-Putin meeting, the details of which are still in the works. Although it could be argued that in hopes of reaching a “grand bargain” with Trump on issues of real importance to Moscow, like Ukraine and sanctions relief, Russia might have been tempted to support Trump on JCPOA and distance itself from Iran, the reality is different. Moscow is too dependent on Iran’s forces in Syria to ensure control and stabilization. It cannot afford to alienate its essential military ally on an issue where Iran’s position has more legitimacy in Moscow’s eyes than Washington’s. The costs of sidling up to the United States are too high for Russia, especially when the geopolitical benefits of currying Trump’s fleeting favor are uncertain and have not even been dangled. The best Moscow can do under the circumstances is to try to form a common position with the EU, China and Iran to keep the JCPOA in place irrespective of what the U.S. does in its moment of madness. Iran might even have its own reasons for staying in the deal too, like keeping economic channels with Europe, China and Russia open, for instance. Were Iran to stay in at Russia’s urging, it would provide a rare diplomatic coup for Moscow.","https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2018/05/08/why-russia-wants-the-iran-deal-op-ed-a61386"
"Europe Is Determined to Save the Iran Deal","It has been more than 300 years since Iran and France launched official diplomatic ties. The initial contact between the two nations dates back to the late 16th and early 17th centuries, when the kingdom of Persia tried to secure support from European nations against a powerful neighbor: the Ottoman Empire. France was a popular destination for Iranian kings wishing to spend their time abroad, and Iran was a strategically important country at the crossroads of the Silk Road with unlimited access to the Persian Gulf. This made Iran-France relations particularly close. The two countries maintained cordial ties until the Islamic Revolution of 1979, which changed the political landscape of the Middle East and caused a shift in Iranian foreign policy. Iran-France relations suffered enormously as a result of the anti-Western tone of the revolution, and ties were cut for 11 months following the Gordji Affair . This refers to the case of Wahid Gordji, a translator at the Iranian Embassy in Paris, who was suspected by French intelligence of being behind the 1985-86 bomb attacks in the French capital. There were other reasons for the decline in Iran-France relations. The most controversial surrounded the Iranian nuclear program, which started in the early 2000s and lasted until the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) was agreed in 2015. The JCPOA, or the Iran nuclear deal, was signed by the Iranians and leading world powers, including the US, Britain, France, China, Russia, Germany and the European Union. During the talks, France was accused by the Iranian government of taking a hardline approach. In this edition of The Interview , Fair Observer talks to François Nicoullaud, the former French ambassador to Iran, about the ups and downs of Iran-France relations and the new US sanctions. The transcript has been edited for clarity. François Nicoullaud: Relations between France and the Islamic Republic have seldom been “normal.” From the zenith of the return of Khomeini to the nadir of French support for Saddam Hussein during the Iraq-Iran War and its consequences in terms of bomb attacks and hostage situations, they have gone through a kind of seesaw movement that is still ongoing. Today, President Macron is trying hard to keep the balance equal between Iran on one side and the United States and Saudi Arabia on the other side, but this looks like an almost impossible task, with the very real risk of displeasing everyone. Nicoullaud: I had the luck to be posted in Iran between 2001 and 2005, exactly during the second mandate of President Khatami. This was a time of internal political opening, even if the situation was far from perfect, and also a time of mutual engagement between Iran and Europe, in which France played a crucial role. It was the French foreign minister, Dominique de Villepin, who convinced his English and German partners to go together to Tehran in order to open negotiations on the looming nuclear crisis. This common visit of three major European ministers, which took place in October 2003, was a unique event in the long history of Iran. This first endeavor failed for several reasons after two years of efforts, but the dialogue that was then established never fully stopped. It morphed into different formats and finally led to the conclusion in 2015 of the Vienna nuclear agreement, also known as the JCPOA. Nicoullaud: Personally, I see no rationality behind such a decision. I believe the first motive of President Trump was to destroy President Obama’s most emblematic achievement in the international field. In doing so, he has, among other consequences, offered to the Iranians a gift that they had been dreaming of for a long time without ever coming close to it: a rift between Europe and the United States on a major political issue. Nicoullaud: Without any doubt, the new American sanctions seriously affect French and European trade, which had started booming right after the beginning of implementation of the nuclear agreement in January 2016. See the withdrawal of Total, Airbus, Siemens, Peugeot and Renault. European governments and the European Union do not feel bound by such unilateral American decisions, but this is of little avail. All significant European companies have, one way or another, business interests in the US economy. The American market is obviously more attractive to them than the Iranian market. Therefore, they can be easily convinced by the US administration to abide by American laws, and eventually punished if they do not comply. And European governments, being immersed in a free-market economy, have no way to dictate their behavior to major European companies. Nicoullaud: I do not question the determination of Europe to preserve the JCPOA, but the necessary tools have still to be built and put to use. No magic solution will bring back Total or Siemens to Iran. However, it should be possible to protect at least a steady flow of current trade between Europe and Iran. There are some people working hard on such a mechanism. All of this addresses complex, sensitive issues, and time is needed to produce results. In between, of course, sanctions are producing their effects, so we see a kind of race against time to establish this mechanism. On the other hand, I strongly believe that the Iranians have no interest whatsoever in leaving the JCPOA. What would they gain by restarting producing stockpiles of enriched uranium for which they have no immediate need? By remaining faithful to their commitments, they keep the high moral ground in this quarrel, and this will present visible benefits in the long run. My guess is that most Iranians in charge are quite conscious of this point. Nicoullaud: They could eventually, but certainly not through a bilateral negotiation between Iran on one side and Western countries on the other. Such complex, multifaceted issues can only be solved through a collective engagement involving the other major regional actors. Do you remember the Madrid Conference in 1991, following the Gulf War? It failed miserably because — among other reasons — Iran was not invited, but this is the kind of format one should be thinking of at the end of the ongoing Syrian and Yemeni civil wars. The idea has already been floated for several years, but apparently the time is not ripe. Nicoullaud: The JCPOA negotiators have been criticized for not having included at least the Iranian ballistic issue in their agreement. But one has to understand that such an issue could not be part of the negotiating mandate of the Iranian diplomats. The nuclear issue is a civilian matter. The challenge was to find strong enough limitations to an existing civilian program in order to stop any kind of diversion to military goals. It was therefore normal to have professional diplomats in charge of the negotiation. But the ballistic program is a matter of defense, in the hands of the IRGC [Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps]. There could be no question of letting civilian diplomats meddle with it. To address the issue, it would have been necessary to modify in-depth the format of the negotiation. So, all in all, it was a wise decision from Iran’s partners to agree to limit the deal to the nuclear issue. Aside from this somewhat technical point, one has to understand that a sovereign state cannot accept unilateral limitations to its defense capacity without undermining the very core of its sovereignty. This kind of surrender happens only under duress, usually after being defeated in war. Voluntary restrictions of defense capacities can only take place on a reciprocal basis — be it bilateral or, even better, multilateral. Iran is not the only country to possess ballistic missiles in the region. Any solution to the alleged threat of the Iranian missile program can only be sought at regional level in a framework of mutual concessions. It could start, for example, by a simultaneous accession of Iran and its main neighbors to The Hague Code of Conduct, which provides for a mutual effort of transparency on ballistic arsenals. Nicoullaud: Iran, especially since the foundation of the Islamic Republic, is clearly not a “normal” country. But, after all, is the United States a “normal” country? Is France? Is Saudi Arabia? Is Russia? Is China? It would be interesting to hear from Mr. Pompeo his definition of a “normal country” and see what remains on the map. Nicoullaud: The French-US relationship is going through a rather rocky path. In spite of the efforts made by President Trump and President Macron to develop strong personal relations, in spite of their reciprocal visits to Paris and to Washington, the positions of the two countries have proven to be too far apart on too many important subjects: climate, international trade, European defense and, last but not least, Iran. Articles by guest writers. In very simple terms, France supported Khomeini to live in France. A terrorist like that would not have the same privileges nowadays. French firms, especially automotive ones, have profited from exclusive deals. Put two and two together. I apologize for obtuse personal comments that will be directed to my opinion. It is just this form of discourse that is the foundation of us Iranians not being able to build a tolerant society. Just read them. Ya Ali Mostofi (the bearer of the name of the Prophet of Islam and his son in law) Ayatollah Khomeini (RA) was a savior of Iran. He brought back respect and dignity to Iranian nation. Unlike cursed Shah who was a terrorist and puppet to foreign influences and was trying to bring in corruption to Iran in the name of illusory and fake progress. The sycophants of Shah keep trying to bring back the corrupt Phalavi dynasty. God willing they will fail miserably. Ultimately, when west realizes that Iran is not going to crumple under pressure and war, it and west will have normal relations of equals not that of master and slave. God willing, at that point the prosperity of Iran and middle East will grow tremendously. That progress will happen in spite of efforts of sycophants of shah to undermine it. Pretty soon Élysée will blame Iran, Assad and Hezbollah for fueling and supporting the populist gilets jaunes, all the while supporting a military coup in Venezuela and never letting go of Assad must go. That’s the same government that supports the MEK terror cult as a legitimate opposition group to Iran. France with Sarkozy became a total pundit of the US neocons. Comments are closed.

"Trump chastises intel chiefs after they contradict him on Iran and claims of foreign policy success","Updated 11:53 AM ET, Wed January 30, 2019 Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump chastised his own intelligence officials Wednesday morning for being soft on Iran a day after they contradicted numerous administration claims of foreign policy success. The Intelligence people seem to be extremely passive and naive when it comes to the dangers of Iran. They are wrong! When I became President Iran was making trouble all over the Middle East, and beyond. Since ending the terrible Iran Nuclear Deal, they are MUCH different, but.... ....a source of potential danger and conflict. They are testing Rockets (last week) and more, and are coming very close to the edge. There economy is now crashing, which is the only thing holding them back. Be careful of Iran. Perhaps Intelligence should go back to school! When I became President, ISIS was out of control in Syria & running rampant. Since then tremendous progress made, especially over last 5 weeks. Caliphate will soon be destroyed, unthinkable two years ago. Negotiating are proceeding well in Afghanistan after 18 years of fighting.. ....Fighting continues but the people of Afghanistan want peace in this never ending war. We will soon see if talks will be successful? North Korea relationship is best it has ever been with U.S. No testing, getting remains, hostages returned. Decent chance of Denuclearization... ...Time will tell what will happen with North Korea, but at the end of the previous administration, relationship was horrendous and very bad things were about to happen. Now a whole different story. I look forward to seeing Kim Jong Un shortly. Progress being made-big difference!

"","January 12, 2019  Topics    ap photo/oded balilty    US National Security Advisor John Bolton, left, speaks to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a joint statement to the media follow their meeting, in Jerusalem, Sunday, Jan. 6, 2019. January 12, 2019    There’s no evidence behind the national security adviser’s dire warnings about Tehran’s nuclear intentions.    Here’s the dire warning National Security Advisor John Bolton brought Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Jan. 6: “We have little doubt that Iran’s leadership is still strategically committed to achieving deliverable nuclear weapons.” I have found zero evidence to support Bolton’s claim. It is unclear who “we” means, but it certainly does not include the American intelligence community. They have found exactly the opposite. While it is currently trendy to fact-check Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, allow me to suggest that it matters more — a lot more —when  statements made by the national security advisor are untrue. This four-Pinocchio claim is a true whopper and has serious national security implications. Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats certainly does not agree with Bolton. He testified to the Senate last year that Iran “wants to preserve the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action” which expressly forbids Iran from ever having nuclear weapons. He said that the accord “has also enhanced the transparency of Iran’s nuclear activities, mainly by fostering improved access to Iranian nuclear facilities.” That is, we have increased our already formidable ability to detect any Iran violations. The International Atomic Energy Agency concludes , and U.S. intelligence agencies agree, that Iran remains in strict compliance with the deal that shrank and then largely froze its nuclear complex.  Subscribe  Subscribe to the Defense One daily. Be the first to receive updates. In his 2017 statement, “ Worldwide Threat Assessment of the US Intelligence Community ,” Coats was crystal clear on the issue of intent: “We do not know whether Iran will eventually decide to build nuclear weapons.” That is, Bolton has no basis for his statement. “We” — the U.S. intelligence agencies—do not believe that Iran is committed to building nuclear weapons. Nor is this a new judgement, one that Bolton might have somehow missed in the press of his duties. Paul Kerr, in his comprehensive 2018 report for the Congressional Research Service, finds: “Since at least 2007, the U.S. intelligence community has issued unclassified assessments that Iran has not decided whether to develop nuclear weapons. According to the 2007 NIE , ‘Iranian military entities were working under government direction to develop nuclear weapons’ until fall 2003, after which Iran halted its nuclear weapons program ‘primarily in response to international pressure.’” These political intentions are important because Iran clearly has the industrial and technological basis to build at least first-generation nuclear weapons. It is not clear whether Iran has mastered all the techniques for an advanced weapon or has the design for such a weapon. But there is little doubt that it eventually could build them, should it embark on a crash effort. It is the political decision not to do so that prevents their production. If Bolton’s claim were true, then Iran might break out of its nuclearagreement at any minute and race to a bomb. We’d be on hair-trigger alert in the region. We might have to take military action to destroy Iran’s remaining nuclear infrastructure before they surprised us with a bomb. Or as Bolton pithily put it in his 2015 oped , “to stop Iran’s bomb, bomb Iran.” I have no idea where Bolton is getting the intelligence to support this claim. Even the much-ballyhooed documents stolen from the so-called Atomic Warehouse by Israeli agents only show that Iran had the framework for a nuclear weapons program in place by 2003, but not that they ever did much beyond vague plans. The intelligence community stands by its assessment that Iran abandoned the program in 2003. “There is literally nothing new here,” said Jeffrey Lewis, a weapons expert who examined the documents. NBC News reported that “Lewis’ view was echoed by American intelligence officials, who told NBC News that while the documents may contain new details, the story they tell — that Iran once had an unauthorized nuclear program — is an old one.” We may be uncertain how much knowledge the Iranians retain about weapon construction 16 years later, but the Iran anti-nuclear deal was constructed on a worst-case assessment, according to Stephen Mull, who led the U.S. effort to implement the agreement. “We built this deal in a way that it rested on what we can measure and verify,” he said in 2016 . “How much fissile material is there? How big is Iran’s enrichment capacity? Does the international community through the IAEA have the capability to investigate any suspicious activity anywhere in the country?” and so forth. So what explains Bolton’s bizarre claim? Is he learning from his boss, copying President Trump’s practice of lying about even the most obvious and provable facts ? Bolton’s deceptions predate Trump. He honed the technique in the run-up to the invasion of Iraq, when he engaged in a systematic effort to subvert the intelligence on Iraqi programs and bury any evidence contrary to his claims, including: “We are confident that Saddam Hussein has hidden WMD and production facilities.” (No, we weren’t and no, he didn’t.) As Peter Beinart notes , to read Bolton’s columns and speeches over the past two decades “is to enter a cocoon. His writing is filled with assertions—about the purity of America’s intentions, the motivations of its adversaries, the uselessness of diplomacy, and the efficacy of war—for which he offers either feeble evidence or no evidence at all.” A survey of Bolton’s former colleagues by ProPublica concluded that he skews intelligence, that he “resists input that doesn’t fit his biases and retaliates against people he disagrees with.” In short, we have a national security advisor whose temperament and tendencies nearly exactly mirror those of the president — an exceptionally dangerous situation. Trump’s mendacity may encourage Bolton’s, but he needs precious little prompting. As the secretary of state continues this week and next on his overlapping anti-Iran tour of the Middle East, we should brace for a stream of false claims every bit as strong as the ones coming from the White House. In particular, we should spend at least as much time fact-checking their claims as we do those of the youngest member of Congress, whose exaggerations may prove embarrassing, but are unlikely to be fatal. Bolton’s and Pompeo’s falsehoods are paving the way for a Middle East war that will make the dispute over the wall with Mexico look like a border dust-up.

"The Impact of the Iran Nuclear Agreement","President Trump’s decision to withdraw from the landmark agreement jeopardizes the unprecedented visibility international inspectors now have into Iran’s nuclear program.  Backgrounder by Zachary Laub  Last updated May 8, 2018 U.S. President Donald J. Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement and reimpose sanctions jeopardizes the landmark arms control agreement, under which Iran dismantled much of its nuclear program and international inspectors gained extensive access to monitor its compliance. The agreement, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), has been on the rocks since Trump’s election, and the resulting climate of uncertainty spooked many large firms from doing business in Iran, thus diminishing the economic incentives that drew Iran to the agreement in the first place. While Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and the agreement’s European signatories will now look to salvage it, it is uncertain whether they can overcome sanctions pressure from the United States. The JCPOA, which was signed in July 2015 and went into effect the following January, imposes restrictions on Iran’s civilian nuclear enrichment program. The so-called P5+1—that is, the five permanent members of the UN Security Council (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and United States) and Germany—negotiated the agreement with Iran over nearly two years. During this period, the Obama administration said its intent was to set back Iran’s nuclear program so that if Iran were to sprint toward producing enough fissile material for a weapon—an indicator known as “breakout time”—it would take at least a year , up from just a few weeks. More on:  Iran Nuclear Agreement   Iran   Nonproliferation, Arms Control, and Disarmament   Sanctions   Nuclear Weapons  Nuclear restrictions on Iran. To extend that breakout time, the agreement requires that uranium enrichment at Fordow and Natanz be restricted and a heavy-water reactor, at Arak, have its core rendered inoperable; its plutonium byproduct, the P5+1 countries feared, could have been reprocessed into weapons-grade material. These facilities are now being repurposed for research, industrial, or medical purposes, and they are subjected to inspections by monitors from the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The accord imposes limits on the numbers and types of centrifuges Iran can operate, as well as the size of its caches of enriched uranium. (Mined uranium has less than 1 percent of the uranium-235 isotope , and centrifuges increase that isotope’s concentration. Uranium enriched to 5 percent is used in nuclear power plants, and at 20 percent it can be used in research reactors or for medical purposes. High-enriched uranium, at some 90 percent, is used in nuclear weapons.) The JCPOA also aims to guard against the possibility that Iran could develop nuclear arms in secret at undeclared sites. Many of the JCPOA’s nuclear provisions have expiration dates. After ten years, for example, centrifuge restrictions will be lifted, and after fifteen years, so too will limits on the low-enriched uranium it can possess, as well as the IAEA’s access to undeclared sites. Monitoring and verification. Among the open-ended provisions, Iran is bound to implement and later ratify an “ additional protocol ” to its safeguards agreement with the IAEA, which gives IAEA inspectors unprecedented access to Iran’s nuclear facilities. (As a signatory to the Nonproliferation Treaty, or NPT, Iran has committed to never pursue nuclear weapons, but it is entitled to pursue nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.) The agency’s director-general, Yukiya Amano, issues quarterly reports to the IAEA Board of Governors and UN Security Council on Iran’s implementation of its nuclear commitments. He has described the arrangement as “the world’s most robust nuclear verification regime.” The JCPOA established the Joint Commission, with the negotiating parties all represented, to monitor implementation of the agreement. That body, chaired by Federica Mogherini, the EU foreign policy chief, is charged with dispute resolution, and a majority vote of its members can gain IAEA inspectors access to undeclared sites they consider suspect. It also oversees the transfer of nuclear-related or dual-use materials. Sanctions relief. In exchange for these limitations on Iran’s nuclear program and opening up access to international inspectors, the European Union, United Nations, and United States all committed to lifting sanctions. While the United States has only suspended extant nuclear sanctions, it pledged in the JCPOA to remove specified entities from sanctions lists and seek legislation to repeal the suspended sanctions within eight years, as long as the IAEA concludes that Iran’s nuclear activities remain peaceful in nature. More on:  Iran Nuclear Agreement   Iran   Nonproliferation, Arms Control, and Disarmament   Sanctions   Nuclear Weapons  Other U.S. sanctions [PDF], some dating back to the hostage crisis in 1979, remained even after the JCPOA took effect. They cover matters such as ballistic missile production, support for U.S.-designated terrorist groups, and domestic human rights abuses. The United States has stopped enforcing its sanctions on oil exports, freeing Iran to trade on international markets again, but restrictions on financial transactions remain in place. Many banks and other companies, including foreign subsidiaries of U.S. businesses, are wary of doing business in Iran for fear of incurring fines or being barred from dealing on Wall Street, and the United States retained the right to impose new sanctions for nonnuclear matters. A major exception to the U.S. embargo allows Boeing to sell aircraft to Iranian airlines. New Security Council resolutions are periodically needed to keep UN sanctions suspended, so, by alleging a major violation, any one of the P5 members can veto a new resolution. This “snapback” mechanism is set to remain in effect for ten years, after which point the UN sanctions are set to be repealed. Implementation Day, on which sanctions were lifted , came once the IAEA certified that Iran had met preliminary requirements, including taking thousands of centrifuges offline, rendering the core of the Arak heavy-water reactor inoperable, and selling excess low-enriched uranium to Russia. Since then, the IAEA’s quarterly reports have found Iran in compliance with the JCPOA’s requirements. Early on, Iran twice exceeded the amount of heavy water that it is allowed under the agreement, the IAEA reported, but these were quickly resolved . “The nuclear-related commitments undertaken by Iran under the JCPOA are being implemented ,” Amano said in October 2017. The challenge inspectors face is that they are “looking to prove the negative,” says Christopher Bidwell , a senior fellow at the Federation of American Scientists. “IAEA reports talk about where Iran is compliant, but then are silent on known rough issues,” he says, highlighting military sites, for which inspectors must seek access from Iranian authorities or adjudication by the Joint Commission. Also omitted from the public record , the International Crisis Group notes, are reports on Iran’s caches of low-enriched uranium and research on centrifuges. “Monitoring is a physical act, but verification is a political act,” Bidwell says. “How sure are you that what you’ve monitored has told you what you want to know?” The United Nations, European Union, and United States all repealed or suspended the sanctions that the JCPOA specified be lifted on Implementation Day, and since then the United States has also unfrozen or delivered to Iran certain seized funds. Most significantly, the United States stopped enforcing secondary sanctions that targeted the oil sector, which has allowed Iran to ramp up its oil exports to nearly the level it had been prior to sanctions. Those sanctions, however, appear likely to come back into force with Trump’s May 8 announcement of the United States’ withdrawal. The announcement capped the year and a half of uncertainty that had enveloped the agreement since Trump’s election. Trump regularly denounced the JCPOA during his campaign, and with each periodic waiver of sanctions he issued as president, he indicated his distaste for it. In October 2017, he took the symbolic step of “decertifying” the JCPOA, saying he judged it not in the national interest. (Periodic certification, like the sanctions waivers, is not a requirement of the JCPOA itself, but rather, one Congress imposed on the president as negotiations were in their final phase.) In January 2018 he issued an ultimatum, saying that if Congress and the United States’ European allies failed to “fix the deal’s disastrous flaws” prior to the next deadline, May 12, he would withdraw the United States from it. Trump objected that the agreement put no restrictions on Iran’s ballistic missiles program or its regional policies, as well as to aspects of the inspections regime and sunset clauses included in it. Even before the U.S. decertification, Iranian officials accused the administration of acting in bad faith, claiming that by sowing doubt over its commitment to the agreement and obstructing economic benefits to Iran, the United States was in violation of the agreement . U.S. officials have discouraged foreign governments and companies from trade with and investment in Iran, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif charged, and the U.S. Treasury under Trump has not licensed the sale of any aircraft or spare parts to Iran. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimated the country’s non-oil growth in 2017 reached 4 percent. Still, Iranians have not seen as robust an economic recovery as many had expected to follow the JCPOA’s implementation. The expectation that the United States would restore nuclear sanctions discouraged trade and investment . So too did a wide range of U.S. sanctions unrelated to the nuclear program. Multinational firms fear being held liable for transacting with the numerous sanctioned entities associated with, for example, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), which is ubiquitous in some industries. But factors unrelated to sanctions are also hampering the recovery. Corruption, mismanagement, and aging infrastructure are widely acknowledged barriers to industry , and relatively low oil prices have dampened the revenues to be made from export; oil was trading for much of 2016–2017 at around half the price it had been five years earlier. (The recent surge of oil prices has in part been attributed to the expectation of renewed sanctions.) Economic stagnation and rising inequality drove a week of widespread protests that began at the end of 2017. The JCPOA was contentious in Iran even before Trump’s election. “The Rouhani government oversold its ability to generate economic recovery following the sanctions relief,” Georgetown University’s Ariane Tabatabai said in an interview before Rouhani was reelected in May 2017, “and so now it is dialing back expectations of what is realistic.” The government has since argued that the recovery will take more time, and that its lag cannot be attributed to sanctions alone. Hard-liners in Iran argued that the United States was angling all along to keep the Iranian economy depressed and that Rouhani was hoodwinked into unfavorable terms, a view they said was bolstered by extreme rhetoric from some members of the Trump administration and Congress. They argued that Iran had “redesigned its nuclear facilities while the sanctions have only been suspended,” and so the United States could reinstate sanctions with relative ease even as the Iranian nuclear program had been permanently set back, said Mohammad Ayatollahi Tabaar , an assistant professor at Texas A&M University’s Bush School of Government and Public Service. Iran could continue to implement its JCPOA obligations as long as the agreement’s European signatories remain committed to carrying out the agreement. But with the United States’ withdrawal, there will be greater pressure in Iran for retaliatory steps, such as incrementally ramping up its nuclear program, or, in an extreme case, withdrawing from the JCPOA, or even the Nonproliferation Treaty. The other parties to the JCPOA are firmly behind it. French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel vigorously lobbied President Trump to remain in the agreement during recent visits to the White House, and British Foreign Minister Boris Johnson made a similar appeal as the May deadline approached. France, Germany, and the United Kingdom were all open to addressing the Trump administration’s concerns in a side agreement, but talks broke down over reinstating sanctions once certain restrictions expire; the European parties argued such a move would violate the agreement. To preserve the JCPOA, the EU could seek to insulate European firms from U.S. secondary sanctions and facilitate oil trade with Iran. Yet the JCPOA could still erode if European measures to preserve it are not sufficient for trade and investment to continue, much less increase, or it could collapse much sooner. As long as the United States is viewed as unilaterally abrogating the JCPOA while Iran remains compliant, experts do not expect the United States’ negotiating partners to follow suit and resurrect the global sanctions regime that drove Iran to the negotiating table in the first place.","https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/impact-iran-nuclear-agreement"
"Digital Renminbi: A Fiat Coin to Make M0 Great Again","Contrary to what many think, China does not oppose blockchain technology. Rather, it takes issue with bitcoin and other privately issued cryptocurrencies, which it fears may facilitate financial fraud and capital flight. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has, in fact, had an initiative for issuing a blockchain-based digital renminbi (RMB) since 2014. The project has already generated 71 patents and has initiated a trial operation for an interbank digital check and billing platform. If successful, this digital RMB project could expand the central bank’s influence over both the domestic and international economy. It has broad implications for the geopolitics of money and for the future of private cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. To understand the PBOC’s motives, we must first distinguish between the digitalization of fiat currency and digital fiat currency. They are not the same thing. Each has a very different impact on the money supply and on the power balance between central banks and commercial banks. The digitization of currency, which stems from the advent of electronic payment/clearance and mature interbank IT systems, allows commercial banks to more efficiently and independently generate the credit flows that expand broad money supply, or M2. By contrast, digital fiat currency, enabled by blockchain technology, affects the base currency measure known as M0. Traditionally, central banks directly control base money creation/destruction but have only indirect power over the broader, credit flow-driven monetary supply. Now, with digital fiat currency, they have the potential to bypass commercial banks and regain control of currency creation/supply end to end, thereby structurally centralizing their power in policymaking. The PBOC’s interest in this solution comes as highly advanced digital payment systems like Alipay and WeChat have created a cashless and cardless economy. This is a form of currency digitalization, built upon a network of commercial bank accounts, operating at the M2 level of money supply. By contrast, a digital RMB would be integrated into M0, thus restoring control and influence to the PBOC. As the Vice President of PBOC Fan Yifei put it in a public interview: “With the help of technology innovation, we can gradually transit into issuance and circulation of digital RMB and impose effective supervision of in the private sector.” From 2007 to 2017, China’s M2 supply grew from 40 trillion RMB to 170 trillion RMB ($25.5 trillion), with an average annual growth rate of 15%, far outpacing the 10 percent nominal GDP growth rate over the same period. This massive expansion is largely due to the excessive issuance of commercial bank loans, primarily for real estate development, local governments’ infrastructure projects, and state-owned enterprises. It has led to a highly leveraged banking system and left a huge debt risk hanging over the Chinese economy. What’s more, the measurement of M2 underestimates the real currency growth rate in China due to shadow banking. High-yield “wealth management products” and structural deposits offered by banks, as well as internet financing such as P2P lending, make up a separate financial industry that’s worth 70 trillion RMB. Wealth management products alone have grown from a 0.5 trillion RMB industry in 2007 to a whopping 30 trillion in 2017. These are not counted as M2 and are often hard to track due to their being hidden from bank balance sheets, making it even harder for the PBOC to manage the Chinese economic cycle. Current attempts to address the problem largely consist of more stringent reporting and regulation, but this merely chases behind the problem rather than stamping it out. To get ahead of it requires a new financial system altogether. That’s what’s intended with the Digital RMB, a project that’s conceived of as a means of reasserting monetary control in the interests of financial stability. While the PBOC is still considering different possibilities for network design, it seems likely to be a permissioned network in which nodes are controlled by the PBOC and major Chinese banks. This suggests transactions will be visible to the banks and government, but not to the public. According to Yao Qian, the head of PBOC Digital Currency Research Center, the designated PBOC digital currency system has a few key elements: Some might wonder why blockchain or distributed ledger technology (DLT) is needed at all if nodes are not highly decentralized. The answer is that a blockchain model offers a better coordination paradigm compared to traditional currency supply management, which is heavily dependent on bookkeeping. Blockchain’s tamper-proof nature and private-key cryptography prevent false transactions and counterfeiting, while also making it much easier for the PBOC to manage the circulation flow. The issuance of a digital RMB will not only make cash and coinage obsolete (which is already happening in China), but also make commercial banks and M2 easier to control. It means the PBOC can more effectively control and regulate an overextended debt market. Thanks to blockchain’s traceability and programmability, it will become much more difficult to hide banking products and services from balance sheets. This also allows for easier execution and more accurate assessment of monetary policy, and makes the measurement of currency supply, circulation speed, currency multipliers, and distribution much more accurate. PBOC can write rules at the code level regarding where digital RMB can and cannot flow to. If it wants to cool down the housing market, for example, it can simply set a program preventing digital RMB from entering the real estate sector. As for policing individuals, a person’s spending history and assets balance are immediately evident on the blockchain, making it much easier to accurately assess creditworthiness, detect money laundering, and prevent tax evasion and capital flight. This is, of course, is likely to strengthen privacy advocates’ already mounting criticisms of China’s social credit score model, It’s not clear that such criticism is having any influence over the government’s thinking on such matters, however. A digital RMB could even strengthen China’s influence overseas. If the One Belt One Road initiative succeeds, a digital, borderless, stable currency could facilitate international trade among its 60-plus member countries. This, coupled with the fact that China is the biggest creditor to Venezuela and it holds over 14 percent of African countries’ sovereign debt, would position it to offer a digital RMB as the next reserve currency of emerging-market economies. This would require those countries to confer to China some degree of influence over their monetary conditions. Would they prefer that to their current dependency on the U.S. Federal Reserve’s dollar? It’s an open question. But it will be highly synergetic with China’s rigorous effort of de-dollarization: reducing US dollar asset in both its foreign exchange reserve, largely increasing its gold reserve and selling off US Treasury debt. Either way, these moves could increase tensions between US and China and might even force the U.S. to pursue a similar digital model for the dollar. We still have a little time before such questions become pressing. Even so, change is coming. According to people working on this initiative, adoption will come with a great deal of observation and adjustment over the course of 10 years or more, with experiments in various use cases starting in “special economic zones” like the city of Shenzhen. Eventually, the plan is to use incentives such as increasing the transaction cost of cash to push people towards using digital currency. Cash is expected to disappear almost entirely. The next question is: what does this mean for private, decentralized cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin? It may seem incongruous that blockchain technology, initially introduced under the ethos of censorship-resistance, is now being used by central banks to further centralize their financial power. But from the perspective of the Chinese government, it’s not hard to see why. Over the long term, a digital RMB has the potential to make global trade more efficient and money laundering more difficult. Yet, given worldwide concern over surveillance by centralized institutions – both public and private – and the perennial risk that monetary policy mismanagement could foster a currency collapse akin to the Venezuelan bolivar, there’s no reason to believe such programs will kill private cryptocurrencies. On the contrary, it could boost demand for them. Anonymous, non-sovereign currencies like bitcoin or privacy coins become increasingly important in an environment where government money is closely surveilled and controlled. What’s more, a programmable fiat digital currency could provide a seamless fiat-to-crypto on-ramp. Ironically, projects such as China’s, in which governments aim to concentrate control over money, could foster greater competition from private systems of money such as bitcoin.","https://www.coindesk.com/digital-renminbi-a-fiat-coin-to-make-m0-great-again"
"Trump Withdraws U.S. From Iran Accord","May 21, 2019 WASHINGTON—The U.S. is exiting the Iranian nuclear accord, President Donald Trump said Tuesday, dismantling his predecessor’s most prominent foreign-policy initiative and bucking the appeals of some of America’s closest allies. Speaking in the Diplomatic Room of the White House, Mr. Trump delivered harsh words about the 2015 deal to curb and monitor Iran’s nuclear activity, calling it “horrible,” “one-sided” and “disastrous.” The president said he planned to institute sanctions against Iran, and said the U.S. would sanction...

"Let Obama explain to you why getting out of the Iran deal is a bad idea","The important stories of innovation across the continent’s wide-ranging economies In-depth coverage of the world’s largest democracy for India and its far-flung diaspora Lifestyle, culture, and living well in the new global economy Management news, advice, and ideas for business leaders Create, share, and discover charts, using the same tools as the Quartz newsroom Donald Trump’s decision to pull the US out of the Iran deal today (May 8) runs the risk of dangerous consequences—not just for the nation but for diplomatic relations across the globe, including that for North Korea. And, arguably, there is no one more qualified to defend the deal, and break down the risks in abandoning it, than former president Barack Obama, who led the signing of the 2015 agreement that Trump just broke. The initial agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), was signed by the US alongside several other nations to drop economic sanctions for Iran in exchange for the Middle Eastern country to scale back its nuclear program. Since then, trade has boomed for nations, both individually and collectively, such as the European Union . However, after Trump abandoned the Iran deal, politicians and analysts from across the globe have criticized the move as unwise and noted that it risks increasing the tensions within the Middle East, as well as alienating the important US allies (including the EU) who signed the deal alongside America. In a statement released commenting Trump’s decision on the JCPOA, Obama highlighted the success achieved by the deal so far and what breaking the pact could mean for the global stage—not just on a practical level, but as a symbol of a diplomatic achievement and an American commitment, particularly at a time when the US is focusing on a peaceful solution of the tensions with North Korea. This decision, Obama says, makes America—not Iran—look untrustworthy. “The consistent flouting of agreements that our country is a party to risks eroding America’s credibility,” he writes, “and puts us at odds with the world’s major powers.” Obama also clearly distills the serious risks in abandoning a framework to control Iran’s nuclear program. “If the constraints on Iran’s nuclear program under the JCPOA are lost,” he writes, “we could be hastening the day when we are faced with the choice between living with that threat, or going to war to prevent it.” There are few issues more important to the security of the United States than the potential spread of nuclear weapons, or the potential for even more destructive war in the Middle East. That’s why the United States negotiated the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in the first place. The reality is clear. The JCPOA is working – that is a view shared by our European allies, independent experts, and the current U.S. Secretary of Defense. The JCPOA is in America’s interest – it has significantly rolled back Iran’s nuclear program. And the JCPOA is a model for what diplomacy can accomplish – its inspections and verification regime is precisely what the United States should be working to put in place with North Korea. Indeed, at a time when we are all rooting for diplomacy with North Korea to succeed, walking away from the JCPOA risks losing a deal that accomplishes – with Iran – the very outcome that we are pursuing with the North Koreans. That is why today’s announcement is so misguided. Walking away from the JCPOA turns our back on America’s closest allies, and an agreement that our country’s leading diplomats, scientists, and intelligence professionals negotiated. In a democracy, there will always be changes in policies and priorities from one Administration to the next. But the consistent flouting of agreements that our country is a party to risks eroding America’s credibility, and puts us at odds with the world’s major powers. Debates in our country should be informed by facts, especially debates that have proven to be divisive. So it’s important to review several facts about the JCPOA. First, the JCPOA was not just an agreement between my Administration and the Iranian government. After years of building an international coalition that could impose crippling sanctions on Iran, we reached the JCPOA together with the United Kingdom, France, Germany, the European Union, Russia, China, and Iran. It is a multilateral arms control deal, unanimously endorsed by a United Nations Security Council Resolution. Second, the JCPOA has worked in rolling back Iran’s nuclear program. For decades, Iran had steadily advanced its nuclear program, approaching the point where they could rapidly produce enough fissile material to build a bomb. The JCPOA put a lid on that breakout capacity. Since the JCPOA was implemented, Iran has destroyed the core of a reactor that could have produced weapons-grade plutonium; removed two-thirds of its centrifuges (over 13,000) and placed them under international monitoring; and eliminated 97 percent of its stockpile of enriched uranium – the raw materials necessary for a bomb. So by any measure, the JCPOA has imposed strict limitations on Iran’s nuclear program and achieved real results. Third, the JCPOA does not rely on trust – it is rooted in the most far-reaching inspections and verification regime ever negotiated in an arms control deal. Iran’s nuclear facilities are strictly monitored. International monitors also have access to Iran’s entire nuclear supply chain, so that we can catch them if they cheat. Without the JCPOA, this monitoring and inspections regime would go away. Fourth, Iran is complying with the JCPOA. That was not simply the view of my Administration. The United States intelligence community has continued to find that Iran is meeting its responsibilities under the deal, and has reported as much to Congress. So have our closest allies, and the international agency responsible for verifying Iranian compliance – the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Fifth, the JCPOA does not expire. The prohibition on Iran ever obtaining a nuclear weapon is permanent. Some of the most important and intrusive inspections codified by the JCPOA are permanent. Even as some of the provisions in the JCPOA do become less strict with time, this won’t happen until ten, fifteen, twenty, or twenty-five years into the deal, so there is little reason to put those restrictions at risk today. Finally, the JCPOA was never intended to solve all of our problems with Iran. We were clear-eyed that Iran engages in destabilizing behavior – including support for terrorism, and threats toward Israel and its neighbors. But that’s precisely why it was so important that we prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Every aspect of Iranian behavior that is troubling is far more dangerous if their nuclear program is unconstrained. Our ability to confront Iran’s destabilizing behavior – and to sustain a unity of purpose with our allies – is strengthened with the JCPOA, and weakened without it. Because of these facts, I believe that the decision to put the JCPOA at risk without any Iranian violation of the deal is a serious mistake. Without the JCPOA, the United States could eventually be left with a losing choice between a nuclear-armed Iran or another war in the Middle East. We all know the dangers of Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon. It could embolden an already dangerous regime; threaten our friends with destruction; pose unacceptable dangers to America’s own security; and trigger an arms race in the world’s most dangerous region. If the constraints on Iran’s nuclear program under the JCPOA are lost, we could be hastening the day when we are faced with the choice between living with that threat, or going to war to prevent it. In a dangerous world, America must be able to rely in part on strong, principled diplomacy to secure our country. We have been safer in the years since we achieved the JCPOA, thanks in part to the work of our diplomats, many members of Congress, and our allies. Going forward, I hope that Americans continue to speak out in support of the kind of strong, principled, fact-based, and unifying leadership that can best secure our country and uphold our responsibilities around the globe.","https://qz.com/1272889/trumps-decision-on-the-iran-deal-obama-explains-why-its-a-bad-idea/"
"Trump Hates International Treaties. His Latest Target: A Nuclear-Weapons Deal With Russia.","The next casualty of President Trump’s suspicion of multilateral deals could be a 30-year-old arms accord with Russia. When Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev solemnly signed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty at the White House, the leaders of the world’s superpowers hailed the transition from an era of “mounting risk of nuclear war” to one marked by the “demilitarization of human life.” But when Donald Trump unceremoniously declared the treaty dead over the weekend, the mood was different. After taking a shot at Barack Obama for not pulling out of the agreement in response to Russian violations, the president complained about how unfair it is that Russia and China get to “do weapons” that “we’re not allowed to,” and boasted of the hundreds of billions of dollars the U.S. military could “play with” were it to build new nuclear weapons of its own. The demilitarization of human life this was not. The Trump administration has yet to formally withdraw from the INF Treaty, but if the president makes good on his pledge, the move would be massively significant. Here’s why. For decades during the Cold War, the United States was obsessed with defending the homeland against the Soviet Union’s nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles. But by the late 1970s, it confronted a new threat from the Soviet nuclear arsenal: the deployment of shorter-range ballistic missiles capable of targeting America’s NATO allies with little advance notice. The United States responded with what the inexorable logic of the Cold War demanded: stationing similar missiles, capable of striking the Soviet Union, in Western Europe. But it simultaneously pursued negotiations that culminated in a 1987 agreement between Reagan and Gorbachev. The INF Treaty required the United States and the Soviet Union to permanently eliminate all ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with a range of 500 to 5,500 kilometers—the types of weapons systems, numbering in the thousands, that precipitated the showdown in Europe. In effect, it eliminated an entire class of nuclear weapons. Along with the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, which drastically reduced the number of long-range Soviet and American nuclear weapons, it was critical in ending the nuclear-arms race. The United States and Russia have for years been trading accusations that the other party is violating the INF Treaty (Russia purportedly with a banned cruise missile; the U.S. allegedly with its missile-defense systems in eastern Europe). But they have persisted with the agreement. Less than a year ago, the Trump administration unveiled a strategy of sticking with the INF while pressuring Russia into compliance through a mix of diplomacy, sanctions, and talk of researching and developing prohibited weapons systems of its own if necessary. As recently as this summer, Jon Huntsman, the U.S. ambassador to Russia, was still describing the INF to reporters as “probably the most successful treaty in [the] history of arms control.” What’s changed is that National-Security Adviser John Bolton now appears to have “the president’s ear on this issue,” Kingston Reif, the director of disarmament and threat-reduction policy at the Arms Control Association, a nonpartisan organization that seeks to raise awareness about arms-control efforts, told me. Bolton, a proto–America Firster who joined the Trump administration in the spring, has long opposed international arms-control and nuclear-nonproliferation agreements that he claims are utterly ineffectual or intolerable infringements on the United States’ freedom of action. During the George W. Bush administration, he helped engineer the U.S. withdrawal from a treaty with Russia limiting antiballistic-missile systems and an agreement with North Korea rolling back its nuclear program, and he championed Washington’s exit from the Iran nuclear deal under Trump. In 2011, well before the United States was calling out Russia for violating the INF, Bolton argued for either bringing new countries into the treaty or scrapping the accord entirely, since it constrained America’s ability to counter rival nuclear powers like China and nuclear aspirants like Iran and North Korea. (Even without its own intermediate-range missiles near China, Iran, and North Korea, the United States can still deter these countries with other elements of its nuclear-weapons arsenal, such as nuclear-capable aircraft and submarines.) Trump has made a strikingly similar case—condemning the treaty for rendering the United States shackled and outgunned by a resurgent Russia and rising China, even as he floats the idea of one day reviving and expanding the agreement to include other nuclear-armed states. Richard Burt, who helped negotiate the INF Treaty during the Reagan administration, said that while he’d “love to believe that this is a very clever strategy to get leverage over the Russians” and compel them to adhere to the terms of the treaty, he seriously doubts it. Instead, he thinks Trump’s decision is an effort to shake off restraints and assert unfettered American sovereignty—just as the administration has done by withdrawing from the Paris climate pact and trade agreements. History teaches that leaders only agree to reduce their stockpiles of nuclear weapons when they improve relations with adversaries and no longer fear the types of war they once did, the nuclear-weapons expert George Perkovich once told me. If that’s the case, however, the inverse is also true: When the ranks of adversaries swell and the specter of war looms large, nuclear buildups are a natural temptation. Trump’s intention to quit the INF and his hesitancy to renew another Obama-era nuclear-arms-control accord with Russia are in one sense symptoms of just how fierce competition between the world’s great powers has become. In walking away from the treaty, the president is recognizing a “changed reality” in both technological and strategic terms, Bolton declared on Tuesday during a visit to Russia. Burt, who is now a managing partner at the firm McLarty Associates, predicted that a U.S. withdrawal from the INF Treaty would prompt Russia to again deploy intermediate-range missiles and the United States to react by rolling out new sea- and air-based weapons systems even if it doesn’t redeploy ground-based missiles to Europe. (America’s NATO allies, which might not agree to host these missiles, have so far reacted to Trump’s announcement with a mix of praise and criticism .) Burt added that the United States and Russia are now both pouring vast sums of money into upgrading strategic bombers, land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and shiny new objects like hypersonic glide vehicles and anti-satellite systems . “We’re in a process of sleepwalking into a new nuclear-arms race” with no restraints, Burt told me. When he served in government, in the 1980s, there was “a hypersensitivity [to] and awareness of the dangers of a nuclear conflict.” No longer. When it comes to arms-control and nuclear-nonproliferation agreements, Trump has shown himself to be a consummate deal breaker. At the same time, in his pursuit of a nuclear deal with North Korea, a better nuclear deal with Iran, and now an expanded INF Treaty with Russia and China, he has yet to prove himself a deal maker. Taken together, the moves could not just encourage an arms race among nuclear-armed states, but push other countries to consider whether they, too, want to add such weapons. “The existing framework for nuclear control and constraints is unraveling,” Burt noted. “If the two largest nuclear powers are walking away from arms-control agreements, it provides an excuse for other countries to acquire nuclear weapons.” “It’s easy to look back [at the Cold War] and say, ‘Gee, we avoided a nuclear conflict because we were so smart.’ I happen to think it was ‘We were very lucky,’” he continued. “And if we’re going to go through another nuclear-arms race, this time we might not be that lucky.” We want to hear what you think about this article.

"Follow B&B","asdasdasdasdasdasdasdasdasdasd The Iran nuclear agreement marked its third anniversary in a gloomy state. Despite repeated attempts to keep him on board, US President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the deal – signed on 14 July 2015 under the formal title the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) – and thereby pulled the rug from under Europe’s feet. European policymakers are now focused on salvaging the agreement. For a growing number of European corporate decision-makers, the deal is already dead. In reality, the JCPOA is on life support and the next few months could open either its next or final chapter. Despite the significant challenges they face, European governments have some limited time to avert the deal’s collapse. In 2015, global powers unanimously hailed the agreement as a historic achievement that proved the effectiveness of multilateral diplomacy. Indeed, the JCPOA provides unprecedented oversight of Iran’s nuclear programme . Furthermore, the agreement states that parties anticipate it will “positively contribute to regional and international peace and security." Many hoped that the resolution of the nuclear dispute would result in a new understanding between the West and Iran, opening a pathway for detente rather than confrontation. Relations between Europe and Iran have certainly made gains in this direction, but the Trump administration’s maximalist stance on Tehran has created an extremely hazardous environment for all remaining stakeholders in the nuclear deal. Since the formal US exit from the agreement in May this year, the Trump administration has sought to sabotage European efforts to sustain the agreement. This has involved a policy of relentlessly threatening and otherwise pressuring any country or company inclined to maintain economic channels with Iran, by weaponising US secondary sanctions. Reportedly, the US administration recently rejected an appeal by the EU foreign ministers to negotiate broad exemptions to such sanctions for European companies. The US clearly intends to specifically target European trade with Iran – although there remain questions about its ability to do so and the reach of US enforcement. Together with its allies in the Middle East – particularly Israel, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia – the Trump administration is increasing its efforts to squeeze Iran on multiple fronts. As a new report by the European Council on Foreign Relations outlines, this anti-Iran front views the collapse of the JCPOA as the trigger for a wider policy aimed at confronting Iran. The policy seeks to cause a deep economic crisis in the country, creating domestic divisions intended to bring about regime change. As part of this, the Trump administration has signalled its willingness to go further than any previous administration by choking off Iran’s oil exports . European leaders’ have repeatedly stated their commitment to upholding the JCPOA. Policymakers are making genuine efforts to find an economic package that minimises the impact of looming US secondary sanctions to sustain Iranian compliance with the deal. But these efforts have yet to generate an environment in which a reasonable number of European entities can make a firm commercial decision to continue doing business with Iran. Although the European Union’s leaders remain unified in their support of the JCPOA, divisions are emerging between the 28 member states over how far they are willing to test the limits of US secondary sanctions. Moreover, several proposed ideas for safeguarding European companies against extraterritorial US sanctions would require months or even years to implement, as they require alternative financial mechanisms that are ring-fenced from US exposure. European governments are also falling short in the political momentum needed to salvage the nuclear deal. For instance, Germany and the United Kingdom are now far more preoccupied with challenges at home than they were in 2015, and EU institutions are focused on averting further transatlantic divide on trade and NATO. Unsurprisingly, many European firms have little confidence that European policymakers will create the conditions necessary to protect them from US secondary sanctions, including by providing alternative mechanisms for doing business with Iran that are compliant with US sanctions. This has resulted in a wave of pre-emptive corporate overcompliance with impending US regulations and a decline in European business with Iran even before sanctions come into force. This month, the foreign ministers of France, the UK, Germany, Russia, and China (the E3+2) met with Iran to discuss political and economic pathways through which they could safeguard the JCPOA. And Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, visited Austria and Switzerland to deliver two overarching messages. The first was that Iran’s patience was wearing thin and its full compliance with the JCPOA was only feasible if it continued to receive tangible benefits from the agreement. The second was that Tehran would abandon the agreement if it became unable to maintain oil exports and, accordingly, its share in global energy markets. Rouhani’s visit followed a tense OPEC meeting, Trump’s call for Saudi Arabia to increase oil production, and weeks of speculation about the extent to which the US could pressure other countries to halt exports of Iranian oil. In Europe, Rouhani stated : “assuming that Iran could become the only oil producer unable to export its oil is a wrong assumption”. The leader of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) was quick to emphasise that elite forces were prepared to act on Rouhani’s words, noting : “we will make the enemy understand that either everyone can use the Strait of Hormuz or no one”. Iran has issued such warnings in the past, including during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war and in 2011 in advance of the EU and US embargo on Iranian oil. Iran may retaliate against any US attempts to curb its oil exports by disrupting regional crude shipments in the strait, through which 35% of all seaborne oil exports pass. Such measures seem unlikely for now – given the risk of military escalation with US and regional naval forces, and of damaging relations with China and Russia, which wish to keep energy markets stable. Rouhani’s statement suggests that Iran is hardening its position. Qassem Suleimani, commander of the IRGC’s Quds Force, unexpectedly welcomed Rouhani’s threat. Despite the significant political and economic challenges shaping Iranian domestic politics, the Trump administration’s maximalist posture may inadvertently lead to a consensus between the Rouhani government and the military elite on how to respond to national security threats. This may abruptly or gradually prompt the Iranian political establishment to shift away from diplomacy with Europe and towards confrontation with the US. Calculations on whether the JCPOA can be sustained will heavily influence this decision. Iran is likely to continue implementing the JCPOA and engaging in diplomacy with Europe for at least a few more months, as it assesses the impact of US sanctions on its economic relations with Europe, China, and India (particularly in relation to oil exports), as well as the likely trajectory of US domestic politics in the aftermath of midterm elections. Unless one side backs down, Tehran and Washington will escalate their dispute in a manner that poses real risks to European interests in non-proliferation, security in the Middle East, and global energy supply. It is imperative that in the coming weeks and months European governments redouble their efforts to sustain the nuclear agreement and ease regional tensions. Firstly, they should continue to explicitly warn the US and their partners in the Middle East that they will not support a strategy aimed at destabilising Iran internally or pursuing regime change in the country. Such an approach risks destabilising a country of 80 million people close to Europe’s border. At the same time, European governments should address their many areas of disagreement with Iran – most urgently, those involving regional security. As ECFR’s new report recommends, this should be done in a strategically careful manner that avoids fuelling further conflict in the Middle East. Secondly, European governments must strive to fulfil their commitments under the JCPOA. They have made a good start by incorporating US secondary sanctions into the EU Blocking Regulation, due to be amended in August. But they need to quickly implement more practical solutions that will affect companies’ calculations on Iran (for a detailed list of recommendations, see the box below). Otherwise, there will be an exodus of European firms from the Iranian market. European efforts to keep Iran in the JCPOA will face major challenges, including US attempts at sabotage. The Trump administration will look to use the JCPOA as a bargaining chip in its bilateral negotiations with Europe, China, and Russia on trade policy, tariffs, and sanctions. Therefore, European leaders must make important decisions about how far they are willing to go to secure a nuclear agreement borne out of more than a decade of diplomacy. They can only do so if they act collectively and firmly. Yet they must do so to prevent escalation between the West and Iran that will have disastrous consequences for global security. The EU/E3 should accelerate measures to establish a foundation for sustaining financial channels (including SWIFT) with Iran before November, when the US will introduce secondary sanctions designed to hit Iran’s oil and banking sector. In this, European central and state banks will have act as a bridging mechanism. While there are ways of moving funds to and from Iran, state banks will have to engage in operations that provide settlement and clearing facilities. At the same time, European governments should remind Iran that their banking relationship can only continue if the country follows the Financial Action Task Force’s road map. The EU and member states should devise a financial framework within which European companies (particularly small and medium-sized enterprises) can do business with Iran while complying with US sanctions. Technical experts have called for the creation of special purpose vehicles or “gateway banks” (supported by European state banks). These mechanisms will need to avoid direct links between Iranian entities and European private banks. Cooperation on this should extend into a larger structure that crosses a coalition of willing member states, thereby sharing risk between them. The EU and member states (particularly leading importers of Iranian oil such as France, Greece, Italy and Spain) should increase their coordination with China and Russia on measures to minimise the impact of US secondary sanctions on Iranian oil exports. European countries should firmly reject any proposed US framework for significant oil reduction from Iran in return for waivers to continue limited oil exports. This would amount to legitimising the US secondary sanctions architecture. Russia and Iran are already in talks over significant Russian investment in the Iranian energy market, which could reportedly involve increased purchases of Iranian oil that could be reprocessed for global distribution via Russia. The E3 and China, together with other relevant private sector entities, should investigate whether it is feasible to offset potential reductions in Iranian oil exports through oil-swap arrangements with non-signatories to the JCPOA such as Turkey and Iraq. The European Commission should incorporate clear guidelines for European companies into amendments to the EU Blocking Regulation. The regulation includes a compensation mechanism (Article 6) that allows European entities to seek compensation if they become subject to extraterritorial US financial penalties. As this mechanism has rarely been enforced, its limits remain unclear. The European Commission should work with member states, regulators and the private sector to clarify and facilitate access to compensation, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises that do business with Iran. The European Commission should mandate a competent body to facilitate legitimate European business with Iran. The body should provide comprehensive oversight of the US Treasury’s enforcement of extraterritorial sanctions. This should involve a reporting mechanism that assesses the legal and other tactics the US Treasury adopts against European companies, pursuant to secondary sanctions. The body should also assist European companies subject to US investigations. The European Commission should address discrimination and overcompliance relating to trade and investment with Iran in the European banking sector. As this problem is a direct consequence of US secondary sanctions, European leaders should primarily address it through regulatory measures that set a burden of proof requiring company boards to certify that their decisions are legally grounded under European law. The Blocking Regulation can provide a foundation for such measures. European regulatory bodies should provide greater oversight of European commercial banks’ decisions to block the flow of funds relating to Iran, reducing the likelihood that such decisions will be arbitrary. The E3/EU should not invest heavily in attempts to negotiate with the US administration on exemptions from secondary sanctions, given the Trump White House’s clear lack of interest in treating European allies amicably. The E3/EU should shift to a more firm and robust negotiating posture similar to their stance on US trade tariffs. They should warn the US about the costs for Western energy consumers of reducing purchases of Iranian oil at a time when Libyan, Venezuelan, and Nigerian exports have been disrupted, given that it remains uncertain whether Saudi Arabia and Russia will increase production to offset this disruption. European governments should limit the US Treasury’s space to demonstrate the power of sanctions in Europe. EU member states should urgently engage in private consultations to prepare countermeasures against US attempts to pressure SWIFT and its board members or to target European entities – using specially designated nationals lists – for doing business with Iran deemed legitimate under EU law.

"Israel opposed the U.S.-Iran nuclear deal. But how happy will Israel be if Trump really scraps it?","Israel had opposed the nuclear deal brokered between the United States and Iran, but if President Trump follows through on threats to scrap the pact, the move will present Israel with a volatile predicament. Though Israel long called the terms of the deal flawed, some Israelis fear its demise would spur Iran to further its nuclear ambitions. Under the deal, Iran agreed to destroy or disable most of its nuclear infrastructure in return for the lifting of economic sanctions. In the words of Yoaz Hendel, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's former director of communications, "we're in the same dilemma … the U.S. administration is in." "On the one hand," he said, "it's a bad deal. Israel and the United States must say that all the time. It's a bad deal." On the other hand, "canceling the deal will mean that Iran will harden its position. It wants to be the regional hegemon, and it will want to prove itself. And I mean that in the Middle Eastern sense — militarily — not using the graces of European diplomacy." The Israeli government declined to comment on Trump's possible actions. The president must notify Congress by Sunday whether Iran is complying with the pact. Over the objections of several of his top national security advisors, Trump is leaning toward announcing that Iran is not in compliance. Netanyahu fought hard against the deal, and the disagreement with the Obama administration shook Israel's historic ties to the United States. "This deal caused us very significant damage," Hendel said in an interview, "but it's spilled milk. If Trump certifies the deal, we have a borderline nuclear nation at our border and major consequences in terms of Iran's subsidy of terror organizations, especially Hezbollah. But if he decertifies, we're back where we were in the old days, where the only way to change the regional situation is a military strike." Candidate Trump made canceling the Iran deal, the Obama administration's signature foreign policy achievement, a central campaign promise. In talking of withdrawing from a deal ratified by Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China, Trump appears to be trying to change the pact's framework. Until now, the agreement focused on Iran's nuclear development. In a recent speech to the American Enterprise Institute , U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley said the United States could change what constitutes "compliance" with the agreement, as Netanyahu has been pushing it to do. Perhaps, for example, a revised pact would address Iran's development of missiles. The International Atomic Energy Agency says Iran has been complying with the deal, but critics say the U.N. agency has been too lenient in its reviews of Iran's actions. If Trump declares Iran out of compliance with the 2015 deal, it would fall to Congress to decide whether U.S. sanctions related to the Islamic Republic's nuclear program should be put back in place. Under law, Congress would have 60 days in which to act. "[Trump] wants the headlines of deconstructing various aspects of Obama's legacy — Cuba, Obamacare, the Iran deal — without the actual real-world impact of those decisions or coming up with alternatives," said Dan Shapiro, who served as U.S. ambassador to Israel from 2011 to 2017. "Even some prominent opponents of the deal are trying to spin the fact that Trump will decertify but Congress will decide not to renew the sanctions that were suspended. They seem to want their cake and to eat it too," Shapiro said. For Israel, said Eldad Pardo, an expert on Iran who teaches at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, "the best case would be to leave the deal and then improve it to include missile development." "Trump's advantage is that Iran perceives him as unpredictable," he said. "They are not irrational actors. They will have to submit to him out of fear that the regime could collapse if Trump prepares for war. Iran is in a position of great weakness in relation to the United States, and rattling the deal will remind them of this." Pardo's prediction may have been borne out late Friday when an Iranian source confirmed to Reuters that, hoping to reduce tensions, Tehran had indicated to the six Western signatories of the Obama-era deal that it is open to talks about its ballistic missile arsenal. The assessment of Israel's military intelligence  professionals has consistently been that the deal has offered Israel tangible benefits — that even though inspections in Iran by monitors are not as rigorous as some would like, they are better than no inspections. "The prevailing view of current and retired Israeli military officers is that while it is flawed, the deal is serving Israel's interests," Shapiro said. "Canceling it now will bring the moment of truth of Iran getting nukes much closer, and that is not to Israel's advantage."","https://www.latimes.com/world/middleeast/la-fg-israel-iran-deal-20171009-story.html"
"Why Scrapping the Iran Deal Is a Dumb Move, Explained","President Donald Trump is expected to announce this week that he’ll scrap the Iran nuclear deal, former President Barack Obama’s compromise with Tehran not to pursue nuclear weapons in exchange for access to the global economy. Trump has long derided the 2015 deal as “one-sided” and poorly negotiated. Key members of his administration, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Defense Secretary James Mattis and his own White House chief of staff, John Kelly, disagree. To help us understand what is at stake, The Root spoke with three nuclear weapons and regional security experts to break down how important this deal is and what could happen if Trump decertifies it. Officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action , the Iran deal was negotiated in 2015 to ensure that Tehran’s nuclear program is used for peaceful purposes. Over the years, Iran has been hit with stiff economic and political sanctions from the United Nations, United States, European Union and others because it was engaged in enriching uranium and other proliferation activities that would help it make a nuclear weapon. The ban included arms exports, bank account freezes against key individuals and companies, and bans on Iranian oil and natural gas exports. Keep in mind nuclear-specific sanctions are not the same as other forms of sanctions against the country. The sanctions caused economic pains on Iran, which harms the country’s general population . Indefinite isolation, former President Barack Obama believed, was not the best approach to punishing Iran. So he decided to make a hard choice: Face a nuclear Iran in a few years and have to deal with the Iranians as well as a nuclear North Korea, or make a tough deal that was bound to piss off most of the hawks in the GOP and regional U.S. allies who have legitimate grievances about Tehran destabilizing their countries by supporting terrorism . The logic was that if America has to face Iran in a military standoff, Tehran would not have nuclear weapons at its disposal—unlike North Korea. Every 90 days, the U.S. president has to certify that Iran is honoring the deal. Trump certified the deal earlier this year. It depends on whom you ask. Generally, the thinking is that Iran is a bad regional player that is already menacing its neighbors by supporting Hezbollah . Hezbollah has supported rebels in Yemen, sent fighters to Syria and trainers to Iraq. It is also the nemesis of Israel, America’s top ally in the region. Iran is causing plenty of regional problems with conventional weapons and well-funded terrorism. If it has nuclear weapons, Tehran will be even more of a problem because, if it has to, it can always threaten to nuke its enemy out of existence. If, say, Israel struck nuclear facilities in Iran, that would still cause a chain reaction in which Tehran could deploy fighters throughout the region to destabilize it. It would be a terror campaign that would never end. The idea behind the Iran nuclear deal is to get Tehran to see the benefits of engaging the global community. Over time, the hope is that its leadership will lose interest in a nuclear program. Saeid Golkar, a nonresident scholar for Iran policy at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, said another less-discussed factor is that many young Iranians are very pro-American and support the deal’s framework—even though Americans did not do much to earn their respect, he added. “During Obama’s presidency, because of his behavior towards Iran, he was more popular than Trump because of the travel ban and his undermining of the deal,” Golkar said. “Right now, there is a very [combative attitude] towards the U.S., but generally Iranians are still very pro-American. Because they are afraid of the strain the sanctions will impose on Iran, which will lead to a harsh economic situation and high inflation.” Pretty much every one of Iran’s enemies. The deal may ensure that Iran does not acquire a nuclear weapon, but it does nothing to punish Tehran for sponsoring terrorism and destabilizing the region. Asha Castleberry—a national security expert who served as the Kuwait desk officer for international military affairs, U.S. Army Central, for 30 months during her 10-year career—said the Obama administration decided to settle with Iran by letting it continue to support such groups in exchange for its not having a nuclear program. She brought up the example of North Korea’s Kim Jong Un, whose country has an estimated 20 nuclear weapons or 60, depending on whose estimates you use. Negotiating with a nuclear enemy is far tougher than dealing with a nonnuclear one, she said. Of course, some of Iran’s neighbors were opposed to the deal for very legitimate reasons. “In their neighborhood, they feel they are being threatened by proxy groups that are supposedly funded by Iran,” Castleberry said. “In the south of Saudi Arabia, you have Iran propping up the Al Houthis in Yemen that are a threat to [Riyadh]. In Syria, you have Iran working with the Bashar al-Assad regime forces that are also a threat to Saudi Arabia. Then you have them working with Hezbollah, that’s a threat to Saudi Arabia and Israel and other places. So, yes, in their eyes, [the Iran deal] is uncomfortable and something they did not want because they felt Iran was going to use that money [that would be freed after sanctions dropped] to support those groups.” Congress will have up to 60 days to decide if it will restore pre-Iran-deal sanctions against Tehran. If Congress does slap Tehran with sanctions, that would technically violate the deal, and Iran could pull out and resume its nuclear weapons program. But that likely will not happen. As Michael Wilner over at FiveThirtyEight notes , the likely approach Congress will take is a symbolic vote against Iran without jeopardizing the practical functions of the deal. So, what, then, does Trump have to gain from pulling out of the deal? Optics. “A lot of it’s perception,” said Bonnie D. Jenkins, former U.S. ambassador for threat-reductions programs. “He really doesn’t like a lot of stuff that Obama has done, so there doesn’t have to be a lot of rationale for what he does. His rationale is that this is something that is associated with Obama, so he’s trying to find a way to get out of the [Iran deal], but he doesn’t have the evidence to do it.” Another point is that Trump does not have unilateral power to dismantle the deal, either, since the United Kingdom, France, China, Russia and Germany are all parties to the deal, too. Even if the U.S. wants to play the rogue player, the rest of the parties can maintain their commitments to the deal without disrupting its main purpose: to keep Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. “The agreement won’t end because the U.S. decides not to certify it, Jenkins, an Obama appointee, said. No one with common sense wants that. Of course, Trump has neither common sense nor an appreciation for how limited American options are in the region. Indeed, the U.S. military is the best in the world, and could defeat Iranian forces in a conventional war situation. The problem is that it would never be a military-to-military scenario that some will neatly map out in their minds (think Iraq). Besides deploying Hezbollah forces and other terror groups against U.S. forces, Iran would be no cakewalk. “Iran is not Iraq. It is not Afghanistan. It’s much bigger. Much stronger militarily, and it is very difficult to fight in Iran,” Golkar said. “You cannot change the Iranian regime because as soon as you fire the first missile in Iran, the people will support the regime. [A military strike] will help the regime consolidate the power and suppress any kind of reform. Nationalists will rally behind the regime and they will have a good alibi: ‘We reached a deal and the United States just threw it away.’” The Iran nuclear deal is not perfect. America has very limited options in the region, which makes conservatives hungry for war unhappy. But it is the best option Washington, D.C., has. With the State Department in disarray and the chance that Tillerson may not be in his position for long, a stable deal needs to be in place. Washington doesn’t need the stress of dealing with a nuclear North Korea and a nuclear Iran. Castleberry added that neither Trump nor the GOP has better ideas. “He’s not proposing a better alternative,” she said. “That was the problem with him and the Republicans. If we have a deal with Iran that stops them from building a nuclear weapons program and you want to get rid of it, give me a better alternative that can stop them. They don’t have one. So are you going to allow them to proliferate?” Terrell Jermaine Starr is a senior reporter at The Root.

"U.S. Iran Policy After the Demise of the Nuclear Deal","Frequently Searched Top Issues Domestic Policy Political Thought International Government Spending Energy & Environment Legal and Judicial Infrastructure & Technology National Security Culture Health Care Poverty & Welfare Economy Summary Tehran is clinging to the nuclear deal because it knows that the agreement does not permanently block, but only delays, Iran’s nuclear ambitions. Iran has played the victim card and is seeking to drive a wedge between the U.S. and the EU to prevent the formation of a united front on sanctions. Washington must impose clear and mounting costs on Tehran for its hostile policies, or the regime will not change course. Select a Section 1 /0 Secretary of State Mike Pompeo unveiled ambitious goals for the United States’ Iran policy in his first major policy speech on May 21 at The Heritage Foundation. Speaking two weeks after President Donald Trump announced the U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear agreement, Pompeo warned that the U.S. would impose “the strongest sanctions in history” to inflict “unprecedented financial pressure unless Iran halted its uranium enrichment program and hostile regional policies.” REF This marks a return to the historical framework of U.S. Iran policy, which was abandoned by the Obama Administration in its rush to reach an illusory and one-sided détente with Tehran. Secretary Pompeo made it clear that the U.S. would not renegotiate the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), as the 2015 nuclear deal is known, but would be open to future negotiations with Tehran on the nuclear issue, as well as other concerns. He proffered carrots as well as sticks. Secretary Pompeo offered to lift sanctions, restore full diplomatic and commercial relations, give Tehran access to advanced technology, and support Iran’s integration into the global economy if Tehran agreed to (1) give a full account of the prior military dimensions of its nuclear program, and permanently and verifiably abandon such work; (2) end uranium enrichment and never process plutonium; (3) offer international inspectors unfettered access to all nuclear sites; (4) release all U.S. citizens, as well as citizens of our partners and allies, jailed unjustly; (5) stop its proliferation of ballistic missiles and development of nuclear-capable missiles; (6) end support for Houthi rebels and work toward a peaceful political settlement in Yemen; (7) end its support of the Taliban and other terrorist groups in Afghanistan, and cease harboring al-Qaeda leaders; (8) withdraw from Syria; (9) end support to Middle East terrorist groups, including Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad; (10) respect Iraq’s sovereignty and permit the demobilization of Shia militias; (11) end the Revolutionary Guards’ support for terrorists and militants around the world; and (12) stop threatening U.S. allies, including Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). These 12 goals are admittedly ambitious, but it is better to publicly commit to attaining them than to turn a blind eye to Iran’s hostile regional policies to preserve a flawed nuclear agreement, as the Obama Administration did. REF The Trump Administration is going big: expanding the parameters of possible negotiations while staking out broad red lines to deter Iran’s malign behavior and offering a vision of mutually beneficial bilateral relations. The diplomatic ball is now in Iran’s court. Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is likely to reject further negotiations with Washington, but his successor will face mounting pressure to return to negotiations. Although Tehran previously had threatened to escalate its nuclear activities if Washington torpedoed the JCPOA, it has announced its willingness to remain in the deal if the European Union, China, and Russia can protect the economic benefits that Iran gained under the deal from renewed U.S. sanctions, which go into effect in two phases in August and November. This reflects how advantageous Iran sees the JCPOA as being, even without U.S. participation. EU trade with Iran has soared from $9.2 billion in 2015 to $25 billion in 2017. Tehran is clinging to the JCPOA because it knows that the agreement does not permanently block, but only delays, Iran’s nuclear ambitions. Iran reaped huge economic benefits from sanctions relief in exchange for making temporary and easily reversible nuclear concessions that it can discard when it serves its interests, as it has done repeatedly before. The JCPOA amounted to little more than a diplomatic speed bump for the ruthless and duplicitous Islamist regime. REF Tehran announced that it is preparing to expand its uranium enrichment capacity, but would remain within the parameters of the JCPOA, if the EU can deliver sufficient sanctions relief. Iran has played the victim card and is seeking to drive a wedge between the U.S. and the EU to prevent the formation of a united front on sanctions. To this end, Iran has even sued the United States at the International Court of Justice in a dubious effort to nullify U.S. sanctions, which Tehran disingenuously contends violate a 1955 bilateral treaty. REF Ayatollah Khamenei gave Iranian President Hassan Rouhani permission to negotiate with the EU to gain protection from U.S. sanctions in a May 23 speech. REF He set several onerous conditions for staying in the JCPOA, including that the EU compensate Tehran for oil revenue lost due to U.S. sanctions, guarantee that European banks will continue financing bilateral trade with Iran, and that the EU should not raise the issue of Iran’s ballistic missiles or its regional interventions. He even stipulated that the Europeans must vote for a U.N. Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) criticizing Washington for withdrawing from the JCPOA. REF It is hard to believe that European leaders, who resent being told what to do by the United States, would swallow these conditions laid down by a theocratic dictator. Even worse, Iran was caught red-handed in a foiled plot to bomb an opposition rally staged by Iranian exiles near Paris. Belgian authorities announced on July 2 that an Iranian diplomat was one of the four suspects arrested for the foiled bomb plot. REF This foiled terrorist plot came after Secretary of State Pompeo warned in his May 21 speech that Iran’s Quds Force, an elite unit within the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, was conducting “covert assassination operations in the heart of Europe.” REF Iran has orchestrated a long list of other terrorist attacks in Europe, including the 2012 Hezbollah suicide bombing of a bus carrying Israeli tourists in Burgas, Bulgaria, which killed six people. At Iran’s direction, Hezbollah also perpetrated a series of terrorist attacks in Europe in the 1980s to punish countries perceived to be supporting Iraq in the 1980–1988 Iran–Iraq war. REF In addition to Iran’s terrorist activities, the regime’s repression, human rights violations, and arrests of European–Iranian dual citizens on trumped up charges will continue to undermine and raise questions about misguided European efforts to protect Iran from U.S. sanctions. On June 6, Iran made a show of inaugurating a new centrifuge production facility that will enhance its future uranium enrichment capacity, signaling the EU and the U.S. that it retains the option to withdraw from the JCPOA and ratchet up uranium enrichment efforts. REF Iran reinforced this message on June 27 by reopening a “major” uranium facility in Isfahan that converts yellowcake, a uranium powder, into a gas. REF EU Salvage Efforts Doomed to Fail. The EU is trying to salvage the Iran nuclear deal by assembling a package of economic incentives to induce Iran to remain in the agreement. On June 6, the European Commission updated its Blocking Statute to prohibit EU firms from complying with American sanctions and to protect European companies trading with Iran from secondary sanctions imposed by Washington. But individual companies are more likely to avoid doing business with Iran than invoke this protective measure. U.S. secondary sanctions will force them to choose between conducting business with the United States, the world’s largest market, and the much smaller Iranian market. Iran’s Foreign Minister, Javad Zarif, met in Vienna on July 6 with officials from five other countries that negotiated the JCPOA—Britain, France, Germany, China, and Russia—to discuss a package of incentives to keep Tehran from abandoning the deal. Iran remained noncommittal and Zarif cautioned: “The EU package is a commitment, but we have to wait and see how it will be put into practice before the first sanction date” of August 6. REF These efforts are doomed to fail. Tehran will want guarantees that European countries will continue to buy Iranian oil exports and find a way to transfer payments to Iran by circumventing U.S. sanctions. However, the re-imposition of far-reaching U.S. sanctions will dissuade European companies and banks from risking their access to the much larger U.S. market in order to preserve their Iran trade. Total, Maersk, Siemens, and other major European companies have signaled that they will pull back from Iran. Although EU leaders had proposed that the European Investment Bank, the EU’s own lending institution, should help compensate Tehran for future economic losses inflicted by U.S. sanctions, a bank official on June 6 criticized the proposed plan because the resulting U.S. sanctions would damage the bank’s ability to raise funds in international capital markets. A key element of the U.S. sanctions strategy will be the campaign to cut off Iran’s oil and gas export revenues, which provide over 80 percent of its export earnings. Washington is pushing countries that import Iranian oil to cut their oil imports from Iran to zero by November 4, when the six-month grace period expires for some sanctions announced by the President on May 8. Unlike in 2012, when countries were allowed to continue buying Iranian oil at reduced levels in exchange for waivers on U.S. financial restrictions, the Trump Administration signaled that it will be reluctant to issue waivers on secondary sanctions that prohibit transactions between Iran’s Central Banks and other banks. The threat of U.S. sanctions will diminish European oil purchases from Iran. Iran exported more than 2.4 million barrels per day in May according to the International Energy Agency. That represents about 2.5 percent of world oil production. Roughly two-thirds of Iran’s oil exports are sold to Asian importers, led by China, India, South Korea, and Japan. REF Japan, which is less dependent on Iranian oil than the other countries, importing about 5 percent of its oil needs from Iran, will probably have the easiest time doing without Iranian oil, but China and India will find it harder to adjust. Secretary of State Pompeo said in early July that Washington would consider issuing waivers for a “handful” of countries to buy Iranian oil. REF India, South Korea, and a few others were granted such waivers during the previous round of sanctions. China, Iran’s leading oil customer and trading partner, has made it clear that it will not support U.S. sanctions on Iran. It complied with the 2010 U.N. sanctions and reduced its oil imports from Iran by up to one-quarter. However, U.S. officials expect that China will actually increase its imports of Iranian oil to take advantage of discounted prices and will channel payments through a Chinese bank that has a limited exposure to the global financial system, and therefore could evade U.S. secondary sanctions. REF Slow-Motion Crisis. Once it becomes clear that the EU cannot save Iran from the consequences of its hostile foreign policy, Tehran is likely to abandon the JCPOA and ratchet up its uranium enrichment efforts. But rather than provoking a crisis that could unify the U.S. and EU, as well as increasing the risks of a U.S. military response, Tehran is likely to take incremental steps to revive nuclear activities limited by the JCPOA, thereby preserving its option to negotiate another deal and avoid backing itself into a dangerous corner. If it rushes to escalate its uranium enrichment efforts, then Tehran would lose diplomatic support from Russia and China, which would be more likely to enforce a new round of sanctions. Such a confrontational strategy would put Tehran on a collision course with a greater number of countries, which would raise the economic and political costs to the regime, as well as the risks that greater economic hardship would fuel political instability or even a popular revolt inside Iran. Iran’s long-suffering people have been afflicted by falling living standards, rising inflation, high unemployment, surging food prices, insolvent banks, and shortages of affordable housing, goods, and drinking water. Iran’s currency, the rial, has steadily lost value since President Trump’s October announcement decertifying the JCPOA, signaling his intention to re-impose sanctions. Iranians have moved $59 billion out of the country between March 2016 and March 2018, and the flight of capital is accelerating. REF The Central Bank of Iran made a bad situation worse earlier this year when it clamped down on foreign exchange bureaus and announced the unification of exchange rates, but failed to provide enough hard currency to stop the slide of the rial. The reeling state-dominated economy is a major political vulnerability for a regime that has proven to be unable to reform itself or satisfy the needs of its own people. Since late December 2017, Iran has been wracked by widespread popular protests over deteriorating economic conditions, economic mismanagement, corruption, repression, and expensive foreign interventions that have diverted scarce state resources from domestic economic projects. By early January 2018, the protests mushroomed to include more than 75 cities, despite a crackdown by security forces that killed at least 25 protesters and jailed almost 5,000. These were the biggest demonstrations since the 2009 nationwide protests against the fraudulent re-election of former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Significantly, while the 2009 protests were led by urban middle-class and professional elites that have long chafed under Islamist rule, the most recent wave of protests has included working-class and poor Iranians from provinces and rural areas that formerly were considered bastions of support for the regime. Although nationwide protests temporarily subsided, sporadic protests over local issues, women’s rights, water shortages caused by mismanagement during a drought that affects more than 90 percent of Iran, and labor strikes continued sporadically, eventually spreading to 30 of Iran’s 31 provinces. When the unofficial exchange rate in Iran surged to a record 90,000 rials to the dollar on June 24, protests spontaneously erupted in Tehran, as cell phone shop owners shut down their shops and demonstrated against the plummeting value of Iran’s currency, which has devastated their businesses. The next day they were joined by merchants in Tehran’s Grand Bazaar, a key constituency for the regime that had played an important role in funding the Islamist extremists led by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini who hijacked Iran’s broad-based 1979 revolution. REF Another salient issue has been the failure of Iran’s government to adequately respond to an ongoing drought. This has generated many local protests including major demonstrations in the southwestern cities of Abadan and Khorramshahr in late June. Rather than take effective action to conserve water supplies or expand desalination efforts, the regime has blamed the water shortages on Israel. On July 2, the general in charge of Iran’s Civil Defense Organization attributed the shortfall in drinking water supplies to “cloud and snow theft,” claiming that “Israel and another country in the region have joint teams which work to ensure clouds entering Iranian skies are unable to release rain.” REF The latest wave of protests have severely undermined President Hassan Rouhani, who denounced the United States for launching an “economic war” against Iran and vowed to thwart U.S. efforts to “defeat our nation.” REF But many of the protesters see the problem as originating with their own government, chanting: “Our enemy is here! It is a lie that America is our enemy!” REF Their ire also was directed at Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s Supreme Leader, whose power and authority greatly outweighs that of the president, under Iran’s constitution. Ayatollah Khamenei is unlikely to agree to abandon Iran’s nuclear ambitions, for which his regime has sacrificed so much to promote. But Khamenei, 79 years old, is in poor health, and his successor may be more flexible on the nuclear issue. As Secretary Pompeo said in his May 21 speech: “Ali Khamenei will not live forever. Nor will the Iranian people abide the rigid rules of tyrants forever.” REF The Trump Administration has embraced America’s traditional role of backing its allies in the Middle East and defending their vital interests against Iran, even if that means hurting Europe’s marginal commercial interests in trading with Iran. Preventing a single power from dominating Persian Gulf oil resources has been a prime goal of U.S. Middle East policy since the Truman Administration. The Obama Administration neglected this goal in an ill-considered and overreaching diplomatic effort to reach a détente with Iran. REF This naïve policy left many U.S. allies in the Middle East exposed to Iranian threats. Israel, Saudi Arabia, and other gulf oil kingdoms grew increasingly alarmed by the overly generous deal that President Obama offered to Tehran at their expense, while backpedaling away from close strategic cooperation with them. President Obama’s risky diplomacy legitimized the illicit nuclear program of Iran’s rogue regime, strengthened Tehran in the economic, military, and geopolitical spheres, and treated it like a normal government, despite the fact that it had a long history of exporting terrorism and subversion, and had been caught red-handed plotting to assassinate the Saudi Ambassador to the U.S. by bombing a Washington restaurant in 2011. REF The Trump Administration also reverted to the historic goals of U.S. nonproliferation policy. For more than five decades, Washington has opposed the spread of sensitive nuclear technologies, such as uranium enrichment, even for its allies. By unwisely making an exception for Iran, the Obama Administration in effect legitimized Iran’s covertly built nuclear facilities, which were allowed to continue to operate, with some restrictions. The Obama Administration handed Iran a better deal on uranium enrichment than previous Administrations gave to U.S. allies, such as South Korea, Taiwan, and the UAE, which were denied that option. It was an even better deal than the Shah of Iran, an American ally, received in 1976, before the Iranian revolution, from the Ford Administration, which denied his request for an enrichment capability. The JCPOA did a much better job of dismantling sanctions against Iran than it did in dismantling Iran’s nuclear program. Moreover, it did too little for too short a period to curb Iran’s nuclear program, while ignoring many other threatening Iranian activities. Rather than focusing narrowly on the nuclear issue, as the Obama Administration did, the Trump Administration has laid down markers on the entire range of Tehran’s malign activities. The goal is to deter and penalize the regime’s aggressive regional interventions and hold the regime accountable for its export of subversion and terrorism. As part of the effort to maximize diplomatic and economic pressure on Tehran, the United States will implement sanctions against Iran’s automotive sector and trade in gold and other precious metals on August 6. Sanctions on Iran’s energy, shipping, and financial sectors will be fully restored on November 4, at the end of a 180-day wind-down period to allow foreign companies time to close down their operations in Iran. By steadily escalating economic sanctions and pushing back against Iranian troublemaking through the coordinated efforts of a network of allies and by firm diplomacy backed up the credible threat or effective use of force, the Trump Administration hopes to induce the Islamist regime to abandon its hostile foreign policy or risk provoking external reprisals or an internal popular backlash that threatens its own survival. After the U.S. withdrawal of the JCPOA, Iran is no longer on an easy glide path to expand its uranium enrichment to an industrial scale, as a prelude to a nuclear breakout. The Supreme Leader and his successor will be forced to make a hard choice: either cling to the regime’s nuclear weapons ambitions and hostile foreign policy, thereby risking increasing sanctions-related economic pain that will further erode the regime’s narrow base of support, or reform regime policies to invest its oil wealth at home, rather than in exporting terrorism and revolution. To address Iran’s nuclear and regional challenges, the Trump Administration should: The Trump Administration should reach out to European allies disgruntled over the U.S. withdrawal from the JCPOA, and seek to minimize rifts that Teheran could exploit. It should explain how the withdrawal and restoration of sanctions advances a broader strategy for rolling back Iran’s baleful influence and containing its threats. The Administration should hammer home the point that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s revelation of Israel’s intelligence coup in seizing Iranian nuclear documents, which many European governments continue to ignore or dismiss, proved that Iran failed to account for the military dimensions of its nuclear program, as promised by the Obama Administration. Moreover, the fact that Iran retained the documents is an indication that it intended to renew those weaponization efforts, if it has not done so already. President Trump’s May 8 re-imposition of U.S. nuclear-related sanctions on Iran gave importers of Iranian oil a 180-day period to significantly reduce purchases of Iranian oil or risk being hit with U.S. secondary sanctions. Renewed oil sanctions are unlikely to be as damaging to Iran as the previous ones, in part due to opposition of many countries to the U.S. withdrawal from the JCPOA, which could lead them to defy or ignore sanctions. Rising oil prices also may undermine the impact of sanctions. Patrick Clawson, a leading expert on Iran’s economy, has warned: European cooperation will be important for reducing Iran’s oil exports, particularly because China and Turkey, two of Iran’s biggest oil and gas customers, have announced that they will not comply with U.S. sanctions against Iran. The EU’s 2012 oil embargo helped to reduce Iranian oil exports from about 2.5 million barrels per day (mbd) in 2011 to 1.1 mbd in 2013. But it is unlikely that such a sharp fall in Iranian oil exports can be expected anytime soon, given today’s tight global oil market with rising prices. Reinstatement of U.S. sanctions could reduce Iran’s oil exports by up to one-third by the end of the year. REF Iran’s oil exports already have started declining, after topping 2.6 mbd in April, and could fall below 2 mbd by early August. REF In addition to the loss of oil sales, Tehran would be hurt by the curtailment of foreign investment and access to technology, which would significantly set back the development of its natural gas exports. REF One prominent concern is the impact of the oil sanctions on global oil prices. Renewed sanctions eventually could diminish Iran’s oil exports by up to 50 percent, but Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Kuwait claim to have enough excess oil production capacity to offset that shortfall. REF Saudi Arabia issued a statement within hours of President Trump’s May 8 announcement on withdrawing from the Iran agreement, promising to increase oil production to offset any shortages caused by renewed U.S. Iran sanctions. Washington should also ask Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and other Arab oil producers with excess production capacity to replace Iranian oil exports to Europe and Asia. Iran’s mismanaged banking sector is also vulnerable to U.S. sanctions. Economist Patrick Clawson has concluded, “Unlike in 2012, banks, not oil exports, are the Iranian regime’s greatest economic vulnerability.” REF Another expert on Iran’s economy, Bijan Khajepour, has noted: “The key shortcoming in the Iranian economy is the nonexistence of a proper capital market.” REF Iranian banks are already suffering from major capital shortfalls, politicized management, and lack of transparency. As U.S. banking sanctions are resumed and Iran grows more isolated from the global financial system and more starved for capital, the regime will face an unpalatable choice: cut spending, which would boost unemployment, or print money, which would boost inflation. In addition to reapplying previous sanctions, Washington should impose new sanctions on Iran. It should levy new sanctions against the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), the regime’s enforcers and the primary conduit for exporting revolution and terrorism abroad. The IRGC already was designated by Washington as a terrorist organization in October 2017, but few other countries have followed suit. The Trump Administration should expose the IRGC’s crimes inside and outside Iran and ask allies to impose their own sanctions on it. Congress should also expand the IRGC sanctions to target entities owned or controlled by the IRGC, including entities in which the IRGC owns less than 50 percent. The Trump Administration also should work with Congress to impose new sanctions on Iranian officials and on construction, mining, and other key sectors of Iran’s economy. Sanctions also will take time to restore and have an effect. Moreover, the sanctions may not be as effective as before without buy-in from European governments, Russia, and China. But as the regime’s economic and political problems escalate, it will be under considerable pressure to return to the negotiating table. When it does, Washington should be ready to negotiate a stronger nuclear agreement that permanently blocks a nuclear breakout—the time needed to produce enough fissile material for one atomic bomb, estimated to be about 25 kilograms (55 pounds) of highly enriched uranium. REF Under the JCPOA, Iran’s nuclear breakout time would have steadily diminished as key restrictions on uranium enrichment expired after 10 to 15 years, gradually reducing Tehran’s breakout time to a few days after year 15. REF The Trump Administration should seek a new nuclear agreement that would permanently bar Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. At a minimum, this would require banning Iran from uranium enrichment activities; dismantling substantial portions of Iran’s nuclear infrastructure; imposing robust inspections on an “anytime anywhere” basis and real-time monitoring of Iranian nuclear facilities; linking sanctions relief to Iranian compliance; ensuring that Iran comes clean on its past weaponization efforts; and establishing a clear and rapid process for reimposing all sanctions if Iran is caught cheating. REF Reaching a grand bargain on all of Iran’s threatening activities is probably impossible, given the regime’s Islamist revolutionary DNA. But it may be possible to make incremental progress on the nuclear issue, particularly if the regime is convinced that its own survival depends on resolving the issue. It is also telling that the IRGC’s harassment of U.S. Navy warships in the Persian Gulf markedly declined after President Trump took office and ended in August 2017. On the other hand, when pressure on the regime is relaxed, it feels free to step up its destabilizing activities. After the 2015 agreement was reached, Iran escalated its military intervention in Syria, started building missile production factories in Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen, provided medium-range ballistic missiles to Houthi rebels in Yemen who launched them at civilian targets in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, and stepped up its support for insurgent and terrorist groups in Afghanistan, Gaza, and Yemen. The credible threat of the use of force is necessary to deter and contain Iran. Ultimately, it is the most important factor that would deter an Iranian nuclear breakout. Sanctions alone are unlikely to end Iran’s nuclear ambitions, just as they failed to stop North Korea’s duplicitous path to a nuclear weapon. The United States must maintain a robust air and naval presence in the Persian Gulf region to deter Iran, reassure allies, and protect the continued flow of gulf oil exports, which Tehran has threatened to cut off if its own oil exports are reduced to zero. In addition, Washington should focus on building up the capacity of regional partners and promoting interoperability with each other and the United States, so that they can better collectively provide for their own self-defense against Iran. The U.S. and its European allies also should strengthen military, intelligence, and security cooperation with Israel and the members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), an alliance of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE, founded in 1981 to provide collective security for Arab states threatened by Iran. Such a coalition could help both to contain the expansion of Iranian power and to facilitate military action, if necessary, against Iran. Washington should build up GCC defense capabilities, particularly in the areas of missile defense, cyber defense, anti-submarine forces, naval forces, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, taking care that arms sales to Arab states do not threaten Israel’s qualitative military edge in the event of a flare-up in Arab–Israeli fighting. The Pentagon should expand and institutionalize joint planning and joint exercises to develop a shared strategy for deterring Iranian aggression and defending the U.S. and allies. U.S. and allied intelligence services should expand bilateral and collective intelligence sharing on Iranian military, terrorist, and proxy activities in the region. Washington also should encourage and further expand the tentative rapprochement between Israel and GCC states to facilitate greater strategic cooperation against Iran. The U.S. Navy should be prepared to deploy warships equipped with Aegis ballistic missile defense systems to appropriate locations in a crisis to help defend Israel and the GCC allies against potential Iranian missile attacks as circumstances demand. This will require coordinating missile defense activities among the various U.S. and allied missile defense systems through a joint communications system. The U.S. should also field missile defense interceptors in space for intercepting Iranian missiles in the boost phase, which would add a valuable additional layer to missile defenses. Syria stands out as a key theater for containing Iran because of the destabilizing threats posed by Iranian Revolutionary Guards and Iranian-controlled Shia militias to Israel and Jordan. The top U.S. priority in Syria appropriately has been the defeat of the Islamic State (also known as ISIS or ISIL). Now that the Islamic State has been decimated, Washington should make it clear that it will not allow Iran to exploit the Islamic State’s military collapse to expand its own influence. Yet the scope and duration of the U.S. military mission in Syria remains unclear, with President Trump publicly indicating that the roughly 2,000 U.S. troops deployed there could be coming home soon. Abandoning eastern Syria would be a mistake that would allow Iran to expand its influence and consolidate supply lines from the Iranian border to Lebanon. The outcome of the struggle for control of Deir al-Zour governate in eastern Syria will be a key determinant of the future balance of power within Syria and the region. Deir al-Zour not only contains much of Syria’s oil and gas reserves, but could become an important part of Tehran’s drive to consolidate control of a land bridge linking Iran to the Levant. Roughly 80 percent of the pro-Assad militias deployed in eastern Syria are controlled by Iran. The United States and its Arab and Western allies should cooperate closely in order to derail Iran’s plans for tightening its grip on eastern Syria. Part of this effort should be to cultivate strong ties to Sunni Arabs in eastern Syria, prevent them from falling back under the shadow of the Islamic State, and block Iranian-led efforts to restore the Assad regime’s repressive rule in eastern Syria. The U.S. should also press Arab allies to assume a greater responsibility for stabilizing eastern Syria with troops and economic support. For example, Saudi Arabia and the UAE could provide special operations forces to replace most of the U.S. forces in Syria, while Qatar and Kuwait primarily could provide economic and humanitarian support for the liberated areas. While this coalition will require continued U.S. air support, logistical help, and intelligence support, it will require fewer American ground forces as Arab allies step forward to replace them. Although the Russian and Iranian interventions have enabled Assad to regain military superiority over the splintered rebel resistance, President Bashar Assad remains a politically weak and despised figure. His regime is completely dependent on the military and economic support of Russia and Iran. Tehran has spent billions of dollars of economic aid to prop up Assad’s regime, at a rate of at least $6 billion per year. REF The United States and its Arab allies can help make this economic burden more painful by ratcheting up sanctions on Iran for its multiple interventions and making it clear that they will refuse to help reconstruct regime-controlled areas of Syria until Iran’s forces and its foreign legion of Shiite militias have been withdrawn. The long-term U.S. diplomatic goal should be a political settlement in which the Assad regime is replaced by a transitional government that limits the influence of Islamist extremists, including the Iranian regime and Hezbollah. In addition to penalizing Tehran for its hostile policies, the U.S. and its allies should also penalize Iran’s allies and surrogates, particularly Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shia terrorist organization which has been instrumental in Iran’s terrorist campaigns and its interventions in Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq. In 2016, the GCC and Arab League designated Hezbollah as a terrorist group. But the EU still sanctions only the military wing of the organization, paying lip service to the notion that Hezbollah’s political leaders somehow are ignorant about or powerless to stop its terrorist operations. Washington should work with Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE to pressure the EU to impose sanctions on Hezbollah. It also should coordinate global efforts to crack down on Hezbollah’s criminal operations, illegal drug smuggling, front companies, and banks that do business with it. UNSCR 2231, which endorsed the JCPOA, maintains a ban on Iran’s arms exports for five years after implementation day. Washington should make full use of this authority to intercept shipments of Iranian arms to Hezbollah, Hamas, Palestine Islamic Jihad, and the Houthi rebel group Ansar Allah in Yemen. Iran’s transfer of increasingly sophisticated rockets and guided missiles to Ansar Allah now poses a rising threat to Saudi Arabia, as well as to the free flow of shipping through the Bab al Mandeb strait and Red Sea. In January 2018, a U.N. panel concluded that Iran was in non-compliance with UNSCR 2216 from 2015 that called upon all member states to prevent the transfer of arms to combatants in the Yemeni civil war. The U.S. and its allies have legal authority to tighten efforts to intercept Iran’s arms-smuggling efforts. Iran also is in violation of UNSCR 223, which prohibited the transfer of Iranian ballistic missiles for eight years. The re-imposition of sanctions will exacerbate economic hardship, which is likely to fuel more protests and labor strikes that will further undermine and delegitimize the regime. Secretary of State Pompeo has stopped short of calling for regime change in Tehran, but suggested that the Iranian people could rise up against the regime. The State Department’s Director of Policy Planning, Brian Hook, explained that “[t]his new strategy is not about changing the regime. It is about changing the behavior of the leadership in Iran to comport with what the Iranian people want them to do.” REF Realistically, the U.S. cannot unilaterally impose regime change short of a costly invasion, or control the process once it begins. Regime change is not likely to happen anytime soon, as long as the regime remains unified. The waves of recent protests have lacked a common leader or unified organizational structure. Protests have focused on local issues, economic problems, women’s rights, and discrimination against Kurdish, Arab, and Sufi minorities, but have not coalesced into a coherent national movement. Moreover, although the regime is increasingly reviled, no popular uprising is likely to succeed unless it includes Iran’s oil workers, who played a critical role in Iran’s revolution when they went on strike in September 1978. Washington can help accelerate, but not orchestrate, regime change in Iran. Ultimately, it is the Iranian people who will hold the Islamist regime accountable for its repression, corruption, human rights violations, and skewed policy priorities. But Washington can help to publicize and promote the legitimate political, religious, social, and economic grievances of frustrated Iranians and support their efforts to recover freedom from the oppressive and predatory dictatorship in Tehran. REF The State Department should identify officials involved in recent crackdowns and other human rights abuses, and apply targeted sanctions against them under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act. The IRGC, the linchpin of the regime’s coercive power, deserves special attention for further sanctions, along with human rights abusers within Iran’s Ministry of Intelligence, police, and internal security forces. Washington should support the right of Iranians to challenge the heavy-handed repression of the Islamist dictatorship, but it should not publicly endorse specific opposition leaders or movements. The CIA should provide covert financial and material assistance to pro-democracy opposition groups similar to the non-lethal aid that the United States extended to Poland’s anti-Communist Solidarity movement during the Cold War. Iran’s newspapers, television, radio, and social media are heavily censored. U.S. officials and technology executives should help to create reliable and secure Web-based platforms outside Iran that could be used by dissidents to disseminate messages and provide uncensored news to Iranians. If necessary, the Administration should relax Iran sanctions to give Iranian citizens access to technical tools to evade censorship and surveillance by the regime. The United States should work indirectly to expose and publicize the corruption, stolen wealth, and hypocrisy of Iran’s leaders. The U.S. could leak pictures of the mansions, stolen assets, and imported luxury goods accumulated by corrupt officials, both inside and outside Iran, for instance. The information campaign should also document and publicize the billions of dollars that the regime has lavished on its terrorist proxy network and on military interventions and subversion in Afghanistan, Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen. Congress also can play a role by holding hearings to expose and condemn the regime’s human rights abuses and investigate additional ways of penalizing the regime for those violations. The Trump Administration should work with Congress on legislation to impose additional sanctions. The overall campaign should make it clear that the United States stands with the Iranian people, not with the repressive regime of the ayatollahs. In the long run, a free Iran is the best hope for peace and security in the volatile Middle East. The Trump Administration has reverted to historic U.S. nonproliferation goals rather than accepting the Obama Administration’s leap of faith, and returned to the pre-Obama consensus on what Tehran needs to do to be treated as a normal country. Washington must impose clear and mounting costs on Tehran for its hostile policies or it will not change course. Firm and relentless sanctions are required to drive home the message that Iran’s current foreign policy course threatens the long-term interests of the Iranian people. If the regime relents, it might gradually moderate its behavior. A grand bargain is unlikely, but a better nuclear deal that makes it much more difficult for Tehran to stage a nuclear breakout may be possible. If not, Iran will continue to stew in its own toxic juices and the regime risks the continued erosion of its base of support and a possible implosion—or popular explosion.

"Trump’s Iran Policy Is ‘Untethered to History’","Interview:  Trump’s Iran Policy Is ‘Untethered to History’  Trump’s Iran Policy Is ‘Untethered to...  Foreign Policy:  Your book argues for the urgent need to “renew diplomacy.” Who is your target audience for this plea? As far out as I can see into the 21st century, I think the utility and the significance of diplomacy is only going to rise. I worry about its drift, which predates the Trump administration. It didn ’ t start at the beginning of 2017, but I do think it has accelerated and gotten infinitely worse over the last couple years. FP:  In your book, you wrote that diplomacy is misunderstood, unheroic, and “less swaggering than unrelenting.” Trump’s Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has famously vowed to restore the department’s “swagger.” Was your word choice purposeful here? Do you think Pompeo is indeed restoring the department’s swagger? FP: Turning to Russia, there seems to be this fixation on Vladimir Putin himself, especially in D.C., especially now. What was it like for you dealing with Putin himself? Do you think the United States and Russia will ever be able to forge a better relationship with Putin in power? FP:  You mentioned in your book there are certain hinge points in history. In hindsight, was there any hinge point in the U.S.-Russia relationship where it all went so wrong ,and could the United States have done anything to avert it? Or do you think this adversarial relationship we see today was inevitable? FP:  This month marks the 16th anniversary of the Iraq War. You described in one chapter in vivid detail how you and other U.S. officials tried and failed to slow walk the U.S. invasion of Iraq. Now, 16 years later, do you feel the U.S. foreign-policy establishment has adequately learned its lessons? FP: One unnamed colleague you quoted on this time period said: “There ’ s honor in continuing to serve so long as you ’ re honest about your dissent. But you never entirely escape the feeling that you ’ re also an enabler.” This quote seems very relevant today, with some civil servants struggling with carrying out some of the administration’s more controversial policies. How do diplomats who might oppose a president ’ s policies on a practical or moral level reconcile this? FP: You do highlight one significant success during that time beyond Iraq: The diplomatic work you and others did to get Libyan leader Muammar al-Qaddafi to give up his weapons of mass destruction program. Do you think there are any lessons from this work you did for the Trump administration today given its negotiations with North Korea? FP: Five Democratic presidential candidates have come out and said that they would re-enter the United States into the Iran nuclear deal if they were elected. Do you think the Iran deal can survive a one-term or two-term Trump presidency? What type would a new administration need to do to bring the U.S. back into the deal? FP:  Turning to Benghazi, you wrote, “Legitimate questions about what more we should have done on security were wrapped up in a set of investigations and hearings that were astonishingly cynical, even by the standards of modern Washington.” The current secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, made his political name first as a junior Kansas congressman through leading the charge on the Benghazi hearings. How do you square that with where he sits in Foggy Bottom today? Can you separate Pompeo the congressman from Pompeo the secretary of state now? FP: A recent U.S. Government Accountability Office report found that chronic staff shortages across the department undermine security for diplomats overseas. Has Washington adequately learned the lessons from Benghazi in terms of ensuring embassies ’ and diplomats ’ safety? FP: You referred to the Trump administration ’ s approach to the State Department as a “profoundly self-destructive shock and awe campaign against professional diplomacy.” Why do you phrase it like that? Do you think this “campaign” is still underway, and what type of impact will it have on U.S. foreign policy? FP: But you and Tillerson both agree that the department is sorely in need of reform. What are some specific and tangible reforms you would undertake at the department to help restore it? WB: As an institution, the State Department is rarely accused of being too agile or too full of initiative.  We’ve tended over recent decades, much like painting and repainting the walls of your house, to add layer after layer of bureaucracy to the department. We’ve become top-heavy. We’ve tended to beat down initiative in the system. So if you’re the desk officer for Jordan and you write a memo and are offering a recommendation, you’re now going have 19 other people that are going to fiddle, not with just your language, but also with the nature of your recommendation. Then you’re going to feel less sense of ownership in either the argument or the prose. FP:  Your book also warns of the “ militarization of diplomacy.” What does that mean, and why is it so dangerous for American foreign policy? Robbie Gramer is a diplomacy and national security reporter at Foreign Policy . Twitter: @RobbieGramer Trending Now Sponsored Links by Taboola More from Foreign Policy Tehran’s military is advancing ever farther into outer space—and the threat is bigger than Washington is letting on.

"Europe’s Last Push on the Iran Nuclear Deal","The Iran nuclear agreement marked its third anniversary in a gloomy state. Despite repeated attempts to keep him on board, US President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the deal – signed on July 14, 2015 under the formal title the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) – and thereby pulled the rug from under Europe’s feet. European policymakers are now focused on salvaging the agreement. For a growing number of European corporate decision-makers, the deal is already dead. In reality, the JCPOA is on life support and the next few months could open either its next or final chapter. Despite the significant challenges they face, European governments have some limited time to avert the deal’s collapse. In 2015, global powers unanimously hailed the agreement as a historic achievement that proved the effectiveness of multilateral diplomacy. Indeed, the JCPOA provides unprecedented oversight of Iran’s nuclear program . Furthermore, the agreement’s preface states that the parties anticipate it will “positively contribute to regional and international peace and security”. Many hoped that the resolution of the nuclear dispute would result in a new understanding between the West and Iran, opening a pathway for detente rather than confrontation. Relations between Europe and Iran have certainly made gains in this direction, but the Trump administration’s maximalist stance on Tehran has created an extremely hazardous environment for all remaining stakeholders in the nuclear deal. Since the formal US exit from the agreement in May this year, the Trump administration has sought to sabotage European efforts to sustain the agreement. This has involved a policy of relentlessly threatening and otherwise pressuring any country or company inclined to maintain economic channels with Iran, by weaponizing US secondary sanctions. Reportedly, the US administration recently rejected an appeal by the EU foreign ministers to negotiate broad exemptions to such sanctions for European companies. The US clearly intends to specifically target European trade with Iran – although there remain questions about its ability to do so and the reach of US enforcement. Together with its allies in the Middle East – particularly Israel, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia – the Trump administration is increasing its efforts to squeeze Iran on multiple fronts. As a new report by the European Council on Foreign Relations outlines, this anti-Iran front views the collapse of the JCPOA as the trigger for a wider policy aimed at confronting Iran. The policy seeks to cause a deep economic crisis in the country, creating domestic divisions intended to bring about regime change. As part of this, the Trump administration has signaled its willingness to go further than any previous administration by choking off Iran’s oil exports . European leaders’ have repeatedly stated their commitment to upholding the JCPOA. Policymakers are making genuine efforts to find an economic package that minimizes the impact of looming US secondary sanctions to sustain Iranian compliance with the deal. But these efforts have yet to generate an environment in which a reasonable number of European entities can make a firm commercial decision to continue doing business with Iran. Although the European Union’s leaders remain unified in their support of the JCPOA, divisions are emerging between the 28 member states over how far they are willing to test the limits of US secondary sanctions. Moreover, several proposed ideas for safeguarding European companies against extraterritorial US sanctions would require months or even years to implement, as they require alternative financial mechanisms that are ring-fenced from US exposure. European governments are also falling short in the political momentum needed to salvage the nuclear deal. For instance, Germany and the United Kingdom are now far more preoccupied with challenges at home than they were in 2015, and EU institutions are focused on averting further transatlantic divide on trade and NATO. Unsurprisingly, many European firms have little confidence that European policymakers will create the conditions necessary to protect them from US secondary sanctions, including by providing alternative mechanisms for doing business with Iran that are compliant with US sanctions. This has resulted in a wave of pre-emptive corporate over-compliance with impending US regulations and a decline in European business with Iran even before sanctions come into force. This month, the foreign ministers of France, the UK, Germany, Russia, and China (the E3+2) met with Iran to discuss political and economic pathways through which they could safeguard the JCPOA. And Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, visited Austria and Switzerland to deliver two overarching messages. The first was that Iran’s patience was wearing thin and its full compliance with the JCPOA was only feasible if it continued to receive tangible benefits from the agreement. The second was that Tehran would abandon the agreement if it became unable to maintain oil exports and, accordingly, its share in global energy markets. Rouhani’s visit followed a tense OPEC meeting, Trump’s call for Saudi Arabia to increase oil production, and weeks of speculation about the extent to which the US could pressure other countries to halt exports of Iranian oil. In Europe, Rouhani stated : “assuming that Iran could become the only oil producer unable to export its oil is a wrong assumption”. The leader of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) was quick to emphasize that elite forces were prepared to act on Rouhani’s words, noting : “we will make the enemy understand that either everyone can use the Strait of Hormuz or no one”. Iran has issued such warnings in the past, including during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war and in 2011 in advance of the EU and US embargo on Iranian oil. Iran may retaliate against any US attempts to curb its oil exports by disrupting regional crude shipments in the strait, through which 35% of all seaborne oil exports pass. Such measures seem unlikely for now – given the risk of military escalation with US and regional naval forces, and of damaging relations with China and Russia, which wish to keep energy markets stable. Rouhani’s statement suggests that Iran is hardening its position. Qassem Suleimani, commander of the IRGC’s Quds Force, unexpectedly welcomed Rouhani’s threat. Despite the significant political and economic challenges shaping Iranian domestic politics, the Trump administration’s maximalist posture may inadvertently lead to a consensus between the Rouhani government and the military elite on how to respond to national security threats. This may abruptly or gradually prompt the Iranian political establishment to shift away from diplomacy with Europe and towards confrontation with the US. Calculations on whether the JCPOA can be sustained will heavily influence this decision. Iran is likely to continue implementing the JCPOA and engaging in diplomacy with Europe for at least a few more months, as it assesses the impact of US sanctions on its economic relations with Europe, China, and India (particularly in relation to oil exports), as well as the likely trajectory of US domestic politics in the aftermath of midterm elections. Unless one side backs down, Tehran and Washington will escalate their dispute in a manner that poses real risks to European interests in non-proliferation, security in the Middle East, and global energy supply. It is imperative that in the coming weeks and months European governments redouble their efforts to sustain the nuclear agreement and ease regional tensions. Firstly, they should continue to explicitly warn the US and their partners in the Middle East that they will not support a strategy aimed at destabilizing Iran internally or pursuing regime change in the country. Such an approach risks destabilizing a country of 80 million people close to Europe’s border. At the same time, European governments should address their many areas of disagreement with Iran – most urgently, those involving regional security. As ECFR’s new report recommends, this should be done in a strategically careful manner that avoids fueling further conflict in the Middle East. Secondly, European governments must strive to fulfill their commitments under the JCPOA. They have made a good start by incorporating US secondary sanctions into the EU Blocking Regulation, due to be amended in August. But they need to quickly implement more practical solutions that will affect companies’ calculations on Iran (for a detailed list of recommendations, see the box below). Otherwise, there will be an exodus of European firms from the Iranian market. European efforts to keep Iran in the JCPOA will face major challenges, including US attempts at sabotage. The Trump administration will look to use the JCPOA as a bargaining chip in its bilateral negotiations with Europe, China, and Russia on trade policy, tariffs, and sanctions. Therefore, European leaders must make important decisions about how far they are willing to go to secure a nuclear agreement borne out of more than a decade of diplomacy. They can only do so if they act collectively and firmly. Yet they must do so to prevent escalation between the West and Iran that will have disastrous consequences for global security. Ellie Geranmayeh is a policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations based in London since October 2013. She focuses on European foreign policy in relation to Iran on the nuclear talks and wider regional issues. Ellie The Ayatollah regime has already destabilised Iran. They have brought on economic ruin. What are you talking about? Who’s side are you on? In your criticism of the Trump administration, you have ended up defending the inhuman Ayatollah regime. Try to criticize both equally. MR Mostofi who’s side are on? We all know well that you are on side of Iran enemies who have commissioned you(and many others) to comment the same tired old comment. One could understand your hostility with Ayatollahs, but you and your team mates are actually are the enemy of Iranian people lets be honest here. Anyone who’s on side of truth and Iranian people won’t go as far as facilitating an economic war on same people who you are pretending to be defending. Anyone who has a basic intelligence would understand that this warfare is only going to devastate the life for the ordinary people not the Ayatollahs but that doesn’t seem to bother you. It is shameful of you bunch to ignore facts and just repeat the mantra that your employers have asked you to repeat. So once again who’s side are on? Ms Elli thank you for your sound analysis of JCPOA’s fate! Now to Ali Mostofi, you are fixated on Mullahs and leaving the people of Iran out of your vocabulary inadvertently or deliberately because you are being paid to do so by the Axis of Tri-Satan +1. Of course you know what countries make up the axes of three nation and +1 is being the MEK. Whether you realize it or not but you have no credibility nor the rights to defending the Iranian people against the Mullahs.

"Trump’s Iran sanctions are a bitter blow for giant European companies","The important stories of innovation across the continent’s wide-ranging economies In-depth coverage of the world’s largest democracy for India and its far-flung diaspora Lifestyle, culture, and living well in the new global economy Management news, advice, and ideas for business leaders Create, share, and discover charts, using the same tools as the Quartz newsroom Donald Trump’s decision to exit the Iran nuclear deal and reinstate sanctions could cost some of Europe’s biggest companies billions. The US Treasury has promised “wind-down” periods of 90 to 180 days to let firms extricate themselves from agreements with Iran and avoid US sanctions. That will do little to assuage the European companies that have billions on the line in recently cut contracts with the country of 80 million people. Energy giants like Total (paywall) and Royal Dutch Shell have lucrative agreements to work with Iran, while Renault has a joint venture to make 150,000 cars a year, and Franco-German plane maker Airbus has reportedly delivered just three out of 100 jets promised to Iran, in a deal worth billions. Trump’s decision comes after an intense, failed lobbying effort by French president Emmanuel Macron, German chancellor Angela Merkel, and British foreign secretary Boris Johnson to keep the US in the international deal. In a joint statement , the three countries’ leaders expressed “regret and concern” and insisted they will stay in. The statement, which didn’t address how sanctions might hit European firms, highlighted that they consider the Iran deal the “binding international legal framework” for resolving the country’s nuclear program. Any European companies with a US arm that agreed a deal with Iran would now be violating US law, says Adam Smith, a lawyer at Gibson Dunn who is a former Treasury sanctions official. Those not active in the US could be hit with a “with-us or-against-us sanction,” in which Washington would tell the company that if it wants to keep trading with Iran they can’t trade with America, Smith said. The only way around the sanctions would be for the Trump administration to grant European companies waivers. Executives at Total already have reportedly met (paywall) with French officials to push them to lobby the US. America’s Boeing was originally granted a waiver for a deal to sell 110 planes to Iran, worth around $20 billion. It’s unclear whether that is now under threat. In a press call today (May 8), US national security advisor John Bolton declined to comment on whether any companies would get a waiver. After Nov. 4, “all the U.S. nuclear-related sanctions that had been lifted under the JCPOA will be re-imposed and in full effect,” the US Treasury said. That means banks will be prohibited from doing any business in Iranian rials or purchasing and selling Iranian sovereign debt. Manufacturers will be prohibited from selling Iran aluminum, steel, coal, and software. The entire Iranian auto industry is sanctioned, as is its petrochemical industry, and investments in ports. Even importing Iranian carpets into the US will be prohibited. In response, European countries could adopt a “blocking regulation,” the EU ambassador to the US explained earlier , which has been used in the past to allow EU entities to ignore US sanctions on Cuba. It could also push for non-US courts to decide any legal conflicts.","https://qz.com/1272832/trump-quits-iran-deal-us-sanctions-are-a-heavy-blow-for-europe/"
"Trump’s Iran sanctions: an explainer on their impact for Europe","Ellie Geranmayeh  @EllieGeranmayeh  12th September, 2018  ECFR presents the first in a mini-series on the likely impact of US sanctions on economic ties between Europe and Iran. President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw the United States from the Iran nuclear deal has placed the European Union and the US on opposing sides of a complex sanctions framework. In recent months, the US has touted its unilateral sanctions as a powerful tool for forcing other countries to halt their business with Iran. European governments have sought to minimise the sanctions’ impact on European companies without opening a major rift in the tense transatlantic relationship. The EU, China, and Russia remain party to the deal – formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) – because it places unprecedented restrictions on Iran’s nuclear programme, thereby contributing to global security. European countries have vowed to hold the deal together (albeit by a thread) for so long as Iran adheres to its terms. Iran reaffirmed its compliance this month. To ensure that Tehran continues to keep its side of the bargain, the EU has scrambled to maintain economic ties with Iran even as a wave of European companies suspend their dealings with the country. In this series of commentaries, ECFR assesses the likely impact of US sanctions on economic ties between Europe and Iran, covering strategically important areas such as trade in essential goods, energy, and banking. The series examines how European governments can minimise the fallout of their attempts to maintain Iranian compliance with the nuclear deal. Part 1: Trump’s Iran sanctions: an explainer on their impact for Europe Part 2: Iran: The case for protecting humanitarian trade Part 3: Can Iran weather the oil-sanctions storm? Part 4: Bankless task: can Europe stay connected to Iran? Part 5: Iran oil exports: 8 waivers and the upcoming OPEC meeting Part 6: Trading with Iran via the special purpose vehicle: How it can work So far, European firms have largely complied with US secondary sanctions. It is unclear whether they will continue to do so, and to what extent, in the long term. In the coming months, the outcome of the dispute will create a precedent for transatlantic cooperation on future sanctions, and will shape other states’ perceptions of European strength and sovereignty in economic policy. Since Trump’s withdrawal from the JCPOA in May this year, American officials have travelled the world to issue an ultimatum to non-US companies: stop doing business with Iran or you will be denied access to the US market and financial sector. This threat has proved even more effective on European companies than the hefty fines they previously received for non-compliance with US sanctions on entities in Iran and Cuba. For most companies in Europe, the balance of interests is clear: their business dealings in the US, and their dependency on the US financial system, dwarf any connection with Iran. European firms that operate in non-sanctioned areas of trade with Iran or that do not rely on the US are attempting to maintain their business with Iranian entities. Nevertheless, they face numerous operational difficulties resulting from the impact of US secondary sanctions on third parties, including financial institutions and the insurance sector. European business executives often make the point that they are answerable to their shareholders and board of directors, and that European governments’ promises to shield them from US sanctions are cold comfort. During the last round of US sanctions against Iran, in place during 2010-2012, American regulators often investigated European companies. At the time, with little serious political pushback from European governments, these investigations resulted in a series of large fines on the firms. The experience had a major impact on many European companies’ calculation of risk. Under the JCPOA, the US agreed to lift some of its sanctions targeting Iran’s nuclear programme. For non-US companies, easing secondary sanctions was crucial – otherwise, they could forfeit their business in the US and face fines. In January 2016, the US rolled back some important secondary sanctions targeting Iran’s energy and banking sectors, and the EU lifted similar sanctions. These measures paved the way for European companies to re-enter the Iranian market. Shortly after Trump’s decision to withdraw from the JCPOA, the US began to reintroduce its nuclear-related secondary sanctions on Iran. The US provided companies with 90-180 days to wind down their operations related to Iran. The sanctions are being reintroduced in two waves. The first, which came on 7 August, covers commercial planes, cars, precious metals, and carpets; the Iranian government’s purchase of US dollar banknotes; and the exchange of Iranian rials (including for funds outside Iran). This wave of sanctions also applies to European companies that provide associated services, such as shipping in these sectors. Europe still needs to do much groundwork if it seeks to minimise the impact of US secondary sanctions The second wave will come on 4 November, targeting Iran’s energy, financial, insurance, shipping, and port sectors, as well as non-US financial entities’ transactions with the Central Bank of Iran and other designated Iranian banks (whose identity remains unclear). These sanctions will be particularly damaging for Iran’s economy, as they are designed to significantly reduce the oil exports the Iranian government largely depends on for revenue, and to block Iran’s access to global financial networks. It remains unclear whether the US will issue waivers and exemptions for specific countries to continue importing Iranian oil after November. In June, the US administration revoked or limited general licenses that it previously issued under the JCPOA. This includes General License H, which enabled US-owned foreign entities to engage in a range of activities involving Iran. France, Germany, and the United Kingdom have called on the US to “avoid taking action which obstructs [the JCPOA’s] full implementation by all other parties to the deal”. The Trump administration has not only ignored these calls but adopted a maximalist position on sanctions, even suggesting that European companies may come under direct sanctions if they continue to trade with Iran. In response, senior figures in Germany and France have called for measures that preserve European sovereignty in trade and foreign policy, including through the creation of payment channels that are independent of the US. Beyond all the talk, Europe still needs to do much groundwork if it seeks to minimise the impact of US secondary sanctions. It has taken some small yet tangible steps. In August, the EU revived its Blocking Regulation , first introduced in 1996, to include US secondary sanctions targeting Iran. Designed to dissuade European companies from adhering to US extraterritorial sanctions, this measure allows EU entities to recover damages arising from US sanctions through civil legal claims against “the persons causing them and nullifies the effect in the EU of any foreign court rulings based on them”. In theory, the Blocking Regulation forbids EU citizens and companies from complying with the US sanctions. In practice, given European multinationals’ ongoing retreat from Iran, there is little to indicate that the measure will have much impact unless it is fully enforced – through, for example, a legal suit in an EU court brought by a company to seek compensation for damages it has suffered as a result of US sanctions. There is very little precedent for such action. Moreover, the Blocking Regulation allows companies to apply for exemptions where they can show that ignoring US secondary sanctions would seriously damage their interests (as many could). However, the Blocking Regulation provides some legal comfort to relatively small European companies that have a limited presence in the US market. The European Commission recently earmarked €18 million of a €50 million package for projects “in support of sustainable economic and social development” in Iran, including €8 million in assistance to the private sector. This figure is incredibly low compared to the €20 billion in trade between the EU and Iran in 2017 . Nevertheless, like the Blocking Regulation, it is a noteworthy political gesture of defiance against US sanctions policy. The EU has yet to decide on critical issues such as the extent to which its banking sector will maintain links with Iran after November, as well as how it will prevent a significant reduction in Iranian oil exports. Like Japan, India, and Iraq, many European companies are engaged in talks with the US administration over how the secondary sanctions will operate, and whether the US Treasury can exempt companies in strategically important areas of trade (such as energy). European governments are also pushing for US exemptions to protect the Belgium-based SWIFT financial information service from current pressure to disconnect Iranian banks in November. During 2010-2012, the EU and the Obama administration were broadly united on their Iran policy goals and sanctions framework. They saw sanctions as a useful tool for coercing Iranian leaders into negotiations on restricting the nuclear programme. This shared perception facilitated coordination between Europe and the US on their sanctions framework and enforcement. The transatlantic political consensus allowed the long arm of US sanctions to stretch yet further into European territory. Today, European governments find themselves in a far more challenging transatlantic relationship. They have few ways to shield European companies from US sanctions and little appetite to impose the kind of substantive countermeasures that could moderate the Trump administration’s approach to sanctions enforcement, such as counter-tariffs. Europe may begrudgingly acquiesce to Washington’s position on Iran – a country in which it has a relatively small economic stake, and which it often views as a destabilising force in the Middle East. Yet if it fails to devise a more effective response to US secondary sanctions, Europe will create a long-lasting precedent for successive US administrations to control European trade and foreign policy.

"Iran’s Crypto Regulations: What’s Happening Behind Closed Doors","Under pressure for being months behind schedule, the Central Bank of Iran finally published a draft framework on the legality of cryptocurrencies in late January and welcomed feedback. While some see the totality of the framework as a step forward, most members of the burgeoning local crypto community are unhappy with much of the specifics. They feel that the framework could severely restrict people and businesses operating in the fast-growing field if it is implemented in its current form. Among other things, the framework proposes banning the use of global cryptocurrencies and various tokens as methods of domestic payment; requires cryptocurrency exchanges to obtain permits, therefore opening a new avenue for rent-seeking in a country that has already too much of it; and uses the word “forbidden” a lot, which could entail the threat of criminal prosecution. So, the local community quickly started working on ways to improve it. On March 9, more than three dozen members of the community sent their proposals to the central bank in the form of a joint document that found 51 problems in the regulator’s 13-page draft framework. However, at least for now, there isn’t much else they can do. The fate of their existing businesses, budding ideas and passion for decentralization is mostly in the hands of larger and immensely complicated centralized power structures. That this is occurring is because money has transformed into a security issue in Iran. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani’s government in early April 2018 “unified” the country’s dual foreign exchange rates in a bid to buoy a national currency sharply declining due to fears of returning U.S. sanctions. Within days, the central bank was directed to implement a blanket ban on cryptocurrencies at the behest of the government in a misguided effort to prevent further capital flight. In early May, President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers and reimposed “the toughest sanctions ever” against the Islamic Republic. This only exacerbated a currency crisis in Iran and led to the rial hitting several consecutive all-time lows in the ensuing months. Moreover, dozens of currency traders were arrested and sentenced to lengthy prison terms and hefty fines while several high-level financial offenders, including a man dubbed the “ Sultan of Coins ” due to his hoarding of gold coins, were executed. On the other hand, Iranian authorities see an opportunity in cryptocurrencies due to its potential to challenge exertion of extraterritorial restrictions. Be that as it may, people actually working on ongoing local projects know they can’t – and are not designed to – circumvent sanctions. Rouhani has personally attended several top-level meetings on cryptocurrencies, the central bank is establishing a sovereign rial-backed cryptocurrency to expand digital banking operations and Iran’s top banks have launched a gold-backed cryptocurrency to sell their bad assets and generate liquidity. Against this backdrop, any entity that has remotely anything to do with cryptocurrencies – as many as 28 – wants to have a hand in the action. After the central bank, the next major entities include the Securities and Exchange Organization, the High Council of Cyberspace, the Ministry of ICT, the parliament, the Ministry of Industry, Mine and Trade, the Ministry of Energy and the Customs Administration. It is worth noting that those entities belong to different, sometimes rivaling factions and each has their own opinions about how or whether cryptocurrencies should be regulated. In recent months, there have been talks that the cabinet may have the final say on passing cryptocurrency regulations. If that happens, it could be a simplifying factor in that it could block many of the lower-level entities from trying to have a finger in the pie. But at the same time, it chips away at the central bank’s authority and highlights the independence it so desperately needs. The fact that so many entities are trying to have a say about cryptocurrency regulations does not negate the central bank’s restrictive capabilities, but it affects its ability to legalize or otherwise support activities in this field, believes Saeed Khoshbakht , CEO of Tehran-based distributed ledger technology solutions firm Areatak. “In other words, we have one rule: everyone needs to be onboard for something to be implemented, whereas only one needs to be opposed to stop a motion,” Khoshbakht, who acted as an advisor for the central bank-affiliated Informatics Services Corporation concerning the regulatory framework, told CoinDesk. He thinks Iran’s cryptocurrency community needs to learn to lobby – “in its positive sense” – since it currently has no effective links to any of the deciding entities. That, he said, could include working toward enacting constructive regulations, alleviating concerns felt by law enforcement and judiciary, and supporting government entities when necessary. “Ultimately, I believe the central bank is Iran’s best bet for regulating cryptocurrencies,” Khoshbakht said. “If making decisions for this area gets out of the central bank’s hands for any reason, including mistakes on the community’s part, I think the situation could become much more difficult.”","https://www.coindesk.com/irans-crypto-regulations-whats-happening-behind-closed-doors"
"Haley wrongly says Congress had no input on Iran nuclear deal","Your privacy is important to us. We have updated our privacy policy to better explain how we use data on this site. Read it here — Nikki Haley on Sunday, October 15th, 2017 in comments on ABC By Allison Colburn  on Thursday, October 19th, 2017 at 12:13 p.m.  Defending President Donald Trump’s decision to decertify the Iran nuclear deal, United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley said Congress now has a voice on the issue that it didn’t have in the past. Trump’s decision allows Congress to potentially kill the agreement or tack on new conditions. "He's saying to Congress, can we make it better?" Haley told ABC’s George Stephanopoulos on an Oct. 15 broadcast of This Week . "And I think that his engagement with Congress is something that never happened under President Obama. They were never allowed to debate it. They were never allowed to discuss it. So, now Congress is going to be fully engaged on the threats of Iran." This was an early criticism of the agreement. After the United States, Iran and other foreign governments came to an agreement on the framework for the Iran deal, both Republicans and Democrats in Congress appealed to Obama to let them have a say in it before the final deal was reached. Here, we are fact-checking Haley’s claim that Congress was "never allowed" to debate or discuss the agreement. Much of the responsibility for U.S. foreign policy falls under the authority of the executive branch . Congress does play a significant role, however, in foreign trade and commerce, immigration, foreign aid, the defense budget and any declarations of war. The Senate authorizes treaties and confirms the president’s cabinet nominees. To avoid needing Senate approval for an agreement with a foreign power, the president can simply avoid calling the agreement a treaty . The Obama administration said the Iran deal was neither a treaty nor an executive agreement. Instead, the State Department said in a letter that the deal "reflects political commitments" between the seven nations involved. When the president negotiates a deal that is not deemed a treaty, Congress -- if it wants a say on the deal -- must convince the president to give the legislative branch the power to approve or block the final deal. That’s exactly what Congress did when it passed the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015 , a bill that had bipartisan support and allowed Congress the right to review any agreement reached in the negotiations. Obama initially threatened to veto the bill but did not. Senators considered a separate, and ultimately unsuccessful, measure that would have given them the the power to block the agreement through a resolution of disapproval. A procedural vote on the resolution fell short of the 60 votes needed to override a Democratic filibuster. Despite the resolution’s failure, by passing the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, Congress was able to have some authority and say in the final agreement. Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., who spearheaded the bill, has touted the legislation for taking "power back from the president" and forcing the executive office to be transparent. "There’s no question the prior administration made every effort to bypass Congress and implement the agreement without congressional review or approval," Corker said in an emailed statement. "That is why we overwhelmingly passed INARA, which required the administration to submit the full details of the agreement to Congress and established a process for a debate and vote on the deal." It should also be noted that Obama administration officials went on the record about the Iran deal during congressional hearings and briefings, allowing members of Congress to bring up questions and concerns with the White House in a public debate setting. Further, the review act imposed a requirement that the president recertify the deal every 90 days. In other words, every three months the president must ensure the following: Iran is abiding by the rules of the agreement, Iran hasn’t taken action to advance its nuclear weapons program, the waiver of sanctions on Iran are still appropriate. "This kind of ongoing management I think is unusual and represented quite a compromise by President Obama," said John Glaser, the director of foreign studies at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute. Glaser pointed out that the Obama administration would not have been able to handle "all of the subtlety, secrecy, and nuance that was required" to negotiate the Iran deal if it had involved Congress from the beginning. Haley, we should note, backtracked a bit in an interview on Meet The Press , when moderator Chuck Todd pointed out that the reason the Iran deal has a certification process is because Congress added constraints. Haley responded: "And Congress did that because President Obama didn't give them the authority to be a part of that decision. So they did it to try and control the situation and not let it get to a bad problem." She didn't add similar caveats during the ABC interview. Haley said Congress was never allowed to debate or discuss the Iran nuclear agreement while Obama was in office. Though Congress had to fight for the right to disapprove of the deal, the passage of the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015 allowed Congress to not only vote on the deal but to also hold public hearings and debate. The Senate ultimately did not have the votes to block the deal, but the act included a requirement for the president to frequently monitor Iran’s progress in meeting the agreement’s conditions. So Congress did have input, even if Obama initially tried to avoid it. We rate this claim Mostly False.

"Donald Trump plans a nuclear arms race in his State of the Union","The important stories of innovation across the continent’s wide-ranging economies In-depth coverage of the world’s largest democracy for India and its far-flung diaspora Lifestyle, culture, and living well in the new global economy Management news, advice, and ideas for business leaders Create, share, and discover charts, using the same tools as the Quartz newsroom Donald Trump’s nuclear diplomacy was on full display in his State of the Union speech on Tuesday, which included the revelation of an upcoming meeting between Trump and North Korean strongman Kim Jong Un in Vietnam on February 27 and 28. Contemplating his recent decision to withdraw the US from the Intermediate Nuclear Forces treaty with Russia, Trump mused that “perhaps we can negotiate a different agreement, adding China and others, or perhaps we can’t—in which case, we will outspend and out-innovate all others by far.” A plan to spend more money on new nuclear weapons than US rivals has another name—a nuclear arms race. Trump’s aides, particularly national security adviser John Bolton, are long-time critics of international negotiations to reduce nuclear stockpiles. Many arms control experts fear that the ultimate target of their efforts is a treaty that limits long-range nuclear missiles, called New START , which remains the last global limit on nuclear arms standing. In contrast, the INF treaty limited land-based medium-range nuclear ballistic missiles during the Cold War. In recent years, Russia has been violating the treaty by developing these weapons, thought the US had also technically done so by moving a sea-launched missile system, Aegis, on-shore. Despite Russian violations, arms control experts argue pulling out of the treaty is strategically unwise. While Russian can use its medium-range land-based missiles to threaten Europe, the US cannot use them to threaten Russia unless it bases them in foreign countries—and few countries are crying out for US nuclear weapons. Thus, in the words of US Naval War College professor Tom Nichols, “we’re letting the Russians bait us into a nuclear standoff that benefits them, because of the home turf advantage.” “I think this is opening the door to an all-out arms race,” an arms control official who worked for president Barack Obama told Foreign Policy . China, which has large missile stockpiles but relatively few nuclear warheads, may see the crumbling of nuclear treaties as a signal to start increasing their stockpiles. In 2018, the US withdrew from a nuclear deal with Iran, which US intelligence agencies believe delayed Iran’s ability to obtain a nuclear weapon. In his speech, Trump argued that the US put in place “the toughest sanctions ever imposed on a country,” which isn’t true—while the US has increased its sanctions on Iran, the rest of the world has not, even setting up an experimental special-purpose vehicle to facilitate trade outside US control. The deal now hangs in the balance, with the rest of the world apparently attempting to wait out the Trump administration in the hopes that the framework can be restored sometime in 2021. When it comes to nuclear diplomacy with North Korea, Trump is right that the country has not launched a missile in 15 months and it has stopped nuclear testing—after a surge in launches at the start of his term brought the US to the negotiating table and led Trump to cancel US military exercises with South Korea. Now, it’s not clear what Trump is prepared to offer Kim in return for North Korean denuclearization, and what Kim would accept, given Trump’s willingness to abandon deals at his convenience. But the summit may be at least an admission of one reality: Trump’s 2018 claim that there “is no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea” was not true.","https://qz.com/1543693/donald-trump-plans-a-nuclear-arms-race-in-his-sotu-speech/"
"Are the US, Israel and Saudi Arabia preparing for regime change in Iran?","As The New York Times reported in November 2018, the United States and Saudi Arabia have apparently reached a framework agreement for the sale of nuclear power stations to the Kingdom. The deal is said to be worth up to $80 billion. However, Riyadh is insisting on creating its own nuclear fuel, despite it being cheaper to buy abroad. There can only be one plausible reason for this pursuit of uncontrolled uranium enrichment. Accordingly, US intelligence officials are increasingly concerned with the question of whether Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman, the gulf state’s de facto autocrat often referred to as MBS, is planning to build a Saudi atomic bomb. Those responsible in Washington or Israel do not seem overly concerned by the prospect; in any case, they are doing nothing to challenge the deal. Likewise, the political and media establishment’s indignation over the murder in Istanbul of the Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi – an act most probably endorsed, if not ordered, by MBS – has had next to no effect. Still, a clear bipartisan majority of US senators voted twice at the end of last year to limit President Donald Trump’s authority in the war in Yemen. Although this nearly four-year-old war, which Mohammad Bin Salman could never have waged without the military assistance of the US and the United Kingdom, has unleashed what the UN considers the greatest humanitarian crisis in the world, the protest votes by the US senate have had absolutely no consequences; a change in US policy toward Saudi Arabia is not to be expected despite the Khashoggi murder. The Saudi monarchy is appeased, and, in turn, continues to demonize the Iranian theocracy – a stark world view with sober geopolitical underpinnings. Close American-Saudi ties date back to World War II, for which the meeting between President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the kingdom’s founder, Ibn Saud, on Feb. 20, 1945, aboard the USS Quincy on Great Bitter Lake near Cairo would later assume great symbolic value. Saudi Arabia has since delivered petroleum to the US under preferential terms, and the US has returned the favor by guaranteeing the Saudi monarchy’s security, primarily in the form of enormous amounts of arms exports – nearly 10 percent of all US arms sales go to Saudi Arabia. Weapons for oil – this is one pillar of the special relationship between the two sides. Another dates back to the 1980s, with the triumph of financial capitalism and Saudi investors’ discovery of the American market. There remains not one publicly owned US company without Saudi capital. While the exact level of Saudi investment in the US market is unknown, the figure is thought to be in the hundreds of billions of dollars. And, finally, there is the decadeslong cooperation between American and Saudi intelligence services, which bore fruit during the Iran-Iraq war (1980–1988) as well as during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan (1979–1989). At that time, the Saudis were providing considerable financing to the Mujahideen, the religious fighters deployed as guerrilla troops to fight the Soviets. The Mujahideen would later spawn the Taliban and Al Qaeda – a fact the Washington political establishment is all too happy to overlook. That Saudi Arabia exports not only petroleum, but Islamist terror as well, must have been a painful realization for Americans on Sept. 11, 2001 – 15 of the 19 assassins came from Saudi Arabia. The consequences? None. Yet another reason for the United States’ unwillingness to rock the boat is the common regional archenemy it shares with Saudi Arabia and Israel: Iran. This triangle – or perhaps square, if the United Arab Emirates is thrown into the mix – considers the Islamic Republic to be nothing less than an empire of evil. They all dream of a regime change in Tehran, if necessary by military means. Washington and Israel above all are convinced that Iran is seeking to annihilate the state of Israel. Moreover, Tehran exercises a brand of power politics that leaves the US allies of Riyadh and Abu Dhabi feeling under threat. The Iranian government has indeed engaged in an increasingly aggressive anti-Israeli polemic. For the sake of balance, it should be noted that the Israelis, particularly under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, have seldom endeavored to temper their rhetoric vis-àvis Iran. But can the Islamic Republic actually “annihilate” Israel, even if its current leadership actually desired to? Strictly speaking, this would be impossible for two critical reasons. First, Israel has the atom bomb and Iran does not. The Israelis share no information on their nuclear potential and, in contrast to Iran, are under no pressure to embrace any significant transparency on the matter. Estimates of Israel’s capacity range between 75 and 400 atom bombs, which puts them in a league with the UK and France. Iran possesses no nuclear weapons and in 2003, as confirmed by US intelligence, ceased all attempts to acquire them. A country without the atom bomb is simply incapable of “annihilating” a country that has them. It is objectively impossible. The second reason calls for a look at respective military budgets. In 2017, Iran had a military expenditure of $14 billion, Saudi Arabia $70 billion, Israel $58 billion and the US $750 billion. The numbers speak for themselves. The suggestion that Tehran is pursuing an expansive program of power politics is – in light of US hegemony in the region since World War II – laughable. It is true that Iran understands how to exploit the mistakes and shortsightedness of American policies for its own purposes. In 2001, Washington toppled the extremist Sunni Taliban regime in Afghanistan, the archenemies of Shi’ite Iran. Two years later saw the US-led invasion of Iraq and the demise of Saddam Hussein, which was followed by Iraq’s Shi’ite majority population claiming power from the Sunnis. The new Shi’ite power elite in Baghdad soon allied with their equivalents in Tehran: Who would have thought it? In each case, Washington did Iran a huge favor. The attempt to effect regime change in Damascus – a policy promoted primarily by Hillary Clinton and the neocons and then thwarted by President Barack Obama – was an unconditional failure. Bashar al-Assad remains in power and his military allies in Iran and Russia have been strengthened as a result. But Syria remains in a state of unrest, as Israel and Iran are engaged there in a proxy war of sorts. At the same time, foreign policy decision-makers in Washington are using all possible means to attempt to thwart Trump’s decision to withdraw US troops from northern Syria. The idea of negotiating with Russia and Iran to come to an agreement on a balance of interests in the region feels to them like treason. A dangerous worldview – on Jan. 13, The Wall Street Journal reported that last September, after three grenades exploded in the vicinity of the US embassy in Baghdad, National Security Advisor John Bolton instructed the Pentagon to work on options for taking military action against Tehran. Nothing is known about the perpetrators of the attack, which caused no injuries or damage of any kind. But why worry about facts when it comes to cracking down on Tehran? There are many good reasons to criticize Iranian policy, but despite all the repression in the Islamic Republic, societal conditions in the country are far more complex, multifaceted and, indeed, liberal than in Saudi Arabia. Power lies in Tehran, not in the hands of a single individual, as in Riyadh. And the Iranian authorities, like it or not, act far more rationally and predictably than MBS. Why then does the Islamic Republic sit squarely in the crosshairs of Washington and its regional allies? Iran is the sole remaining country in a wide stretch of land between the Atlantic in the west and Indonesia in the east (with the exception of the little that remains of Syria) with a political system that is neither pro-Western nor pro-American. This, in turn, has causes that go back decades. In 1953, the CIA and MI6 overthrew the democratically elected and extremely popular prime minister of Iran, Mohammad Mossadegh. Two years earlier, he had nationalized the Iranian oil industry – blasphemy in the eyes of London and Washington. In his place they installed as shah, or sovereign of Iran, Reza Pahlevi, also a close ally of Israel. But the repressive policies of his regime led to the Iranian Revolution in 1979. Nary a historian believes that we would have an Islamic Republic today had Mossadegh not been deposed – it is the radical answer to the coup a generation hence. But who in politics, whether in Washington or elsewhere, thinks in historical contexts? The Trump administration is hardly the only Western government to see Iran as the last remaining rogue nation, now that the neocons and their allies have instigated regime change in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya. Their attempts to do the same in Syria have failed – see above. Trump’s May 2018 termination of the Iran nuclear deal forged under Obama in 2015 is the first step toward his goal of Regime Change 2.0 in Tehran. Although the pact’s European co-signers, along with Russia and China, want to continue to adhere to the terms of the deal, the idea has little appeal for the ideologues of America First, also known as the gravediggers of the trans-Atlantic alliance. Prior to a potential attack of Iran by the US and/or Israel, insurgency financing of ethnic and religious minorities in Iran as well as economic sanctions should be maximally employed to bring Tehran to its knees. (Despite its arms expenditure, Saudi Arabia is still militarily a paper tiger.) And Iran’s ballistic missiles are a thorn in the eye for Washington and Israel, as they can jeopardize the safety of attacking aircraft. The presence of Shi’ite militias in Iraq and Syria is particularly unacceptable for Israel, and the same can be said for Iran’s support of Hezbollah in Lebanon. For the Iranians, however, the focus would be on an asymmetrical preemptive defense in the case of an attack. A peaceful alternative to negotiations with Tehran and the retention of the nuclear deal does not exist. Although the regime sits firmly in the saddle, pressure from the Americans is strengthening the hand of the hardliners at the expense of the pragmatists around President Rouhani. An attack on Iran would bring Armageddon to the Middle East. The entire region would explode: Jews against Muslims, Shi’ites against Sunnis. And what if Russia and China were to come down on the side of Iran, against the US? Would it trigger NATO’s Article 5 on collective defense?

"The Iran Nuclear Deal's Unraveling Raises Fears of Cyberattacks","When the US last tightened its sanctions against Iran in 2012, then-president Barack Obama boasted that they were "virtually grinding the Iranian economy to a halt." Iran fired back with one of the broadest series of cyberattacks ever to target the US, bombarding practically every major American bank with months of intermittent distributed denial of service attacks that pummeled their websites with junk traffic, knocking them offline. Three years later, the Obama administration lifted many of those sanctions in exchange for Iran's promise to halt its nuclear development; Tehran has since mostly restrained its state-sponsored online attacks against Western targets. Now, with little more than a word from President Trump, that détente appears to have ended. And with it, the lull in Iranian cyberattacks on the West may be coming to an end, too. President Trump announced Tuesday that he would unilaterally withdraw the US from the Iran nuclear deal negotiated by the Obama administration in 2015, and impose new sanctions against the country within 90 days. Since then, foreign policy watchers have warned that the move would isolate the US, risk further destabilizing the Middle East, and invite another nuclear rogue nation into the world. But for those who have followed the last decade of digital conflicts around the globe, the unraveling of the Iran deal reignites not only the country's nuclear threat, but also the threat of its highly aggressive hackers—now with years more development and training that have only honed their offensive tactics. "They’ve developed this ability over the last years and there’s no reason for them not to use it now," says Levi Gundert, an Iran-focused analyst at private intelligence firm Recorded Future. "They want to try to induce other countries to think about repercussions before levying sanctions, and they have a real capability in the cyber domain." 'Now all bets are off.' Levi Gundert, Recorded Future For the last decade, the cybersecurity community has watched with growing dismay as Iranian state-sponsored hackers have slowly built up their capabilities and occasionally used them in brazen, chaotic offensive operations that have destroyed data on tens of thousands of computers, and threatened more serious critical infrastructure attacks. The NSA has even warned internally that Iran appears to be learning from the US hacking operations that have at some points targeted the country. But since the 2015 nuclear deal, Iran has largely restricted its hacking to its own neighborhood , repeatedly hitting its longtime rival Saudi Arabia and other Gulf nations with cyberattacks but limiting its attacks on Western targets to mere cyberespionage, not actual disruptive operations. (One exception was the Iranian extortion attack against HBO last summer , whose perpetrator had ties to the Iranian government but seems to have hacked the television network independently.) With the Iran pact crumbling, expect that restraint to evaporate too, warns Gundert. "Most of the destructive attacks were pre-2015. Then we had the Iran deal," he says. "Now all bets are off." Iran's abrupt entrance into the digital arms race came in 2012, when state-sponsored Iranian hackers calling themselves the Cutting Sword of Justice used a piece of malware called Shamoon to overwrite the files of 30,000 machines on the network of energy company Saudi Aramco with a file that displayed the image of a burning American flag. A similar malware infection struck Qatari gas firm RasGas soon after. The attacks, which temporarily paralyzed the IT operations of one of the world's largest oil companies, is widely seen as retaliation for Stuxnet , the NSA- and Israeli-created malware that was unleashed against the Natanz Iranian nuclear facility in 2010 to destroy its enrichment centrifuges. The blitz against American banking websites came the following month. Known as Operation Ababil, the campaign claimed to come in response to an anti-Muslim YouTube video called "the Innocence of Muslims." But the US government interpreted the attacks instead as a retaliatory measure against Stuxnet and escalating sanctions. "It's important to remember that they’ve flexed this muscle before," says John Hultquist, director of research at private intelligence firm FireEye, which has closely tracked Iranian state-sponsored hacking. It's not certain if new sanctions will produce the same response from Iran now, says Rob Knake, a former White House cybersecurity official in the Obama administration who was closely involved in the response to those attacks. He points out that the Obama White House largely brushed off the bank attacks in an effort to get the Iranians to the negotiating table. Iran may fear that the Trump administration and its hawkish national security adviser John Bolton would instead respond in kind. "They might now have a different view of our response if they escalate in cyberspace," Knake says. 'Iranian actors will at least start probing critical infrastructure again, and start on the path toward attack capabilities in the West.' John Hultquist, FireEye But Iran has retaliated for less. In 2014, Iranian hackers used a malware infection to inflict $40 million in data destruction at the Sands Casino in Las Vegas. The casino's owner, vocal pro-Israel billionaire Sheldon Adelson, had made public comments suggesting the US detonate a nuclear bomb in Nevada as a demonstration to Iran of what would happen to the country if it continued pursuit of its nuclear weapons program. After the devastating attack on the Sands, attackers calling themselves "the Anti-WMD Team" left behind a message on the casino's computers reading "Encouraging the use of Weapons of Mass Destruction, UNDER ANY CONDITION, is a Crime." Beyond mere data destruction, Iran has developed more sophisticated infrastructure hacking abilities, too. In 2014, the security firm Cylance revealed that an Iranian state-sponsored hacking group known as Cleaver had broadly penetrated critical infrastructure targets from Pakistani airports to Turkish oil and gas companies to US chemical industry targets and energy firms. "We believe that if the operation is left to continue unabated, it is only a matter of time before the world’s physical safety is impacted by it," the Cylance report read . Now, FireEye's Hultquist warns the end of the nuclear deal will likely trigger a restart of those intrusions. "We anticipate with the agreement going away that the Iranian actors will at least start probing critical infrastructure again, and start on the path toward attack capabilities in the West," he says. Some still-unconfirmed signs suggest that Iran may be developing the ability to not only disrupt critical infrastructure with cyberattacks, but to destroy it. A highly sophisticated malware known as Trisis or Triton hit Saudi Aramco last year, and is designed to manipulate the company's physical safety equipment, with potentially lethal results. (Instead it merely caused a plant to shut down.) That attack hasn't been tied to Iran, though its Saudi targeting has made the country the first suspect—and would hint that Iran's technical hacking abilities are further along than anyone had otherwise seen. All of that suggests that Iran may have quietly grown into a serious threat to any enemy nation that it can reach via the internet. And now that the last three years of tense peace appears to be ending, its list of fair-game targets may once again include the United States, too. Today’s bombs are smaller in size but more powerful. They are also more likely to be delivered via intercontinental ballistic missiles, rather than dropped from aircraft. Here's how they've evolved into weapons that could wipe out entire cities. CNMN Collection © 2018 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

"Donald Trump already told us why he’s shouting at Iran","The important stories of innovation across the continent’s wide-ranging economies In-depth coverage of the world’s largest democracy for India and its far-flung diaspora Lifestyle, culture, and living well in the new global economy Management news, advice, and ideas for business leaders Create, share, and discover charts, using the same tools as the Quartz newsroom He sees it as a good way to save face amidst a heap of bad news. Donald Trump’s all-caps harangue yesterday addressed at Iranian president Hassan Rouhani was unusually strident, even for him. It appeared at first to be a response to a speech by Rouhani, who warned against a US attack on Iran during remarks of his own in Tehran. But it’s worth remembering how Trump sees Iran: Past statements reveal that the US president considers America’s relationship to the country as a useful tool for political misdirection. In 2012, for instance, Trump appeared convinced that Barack Obama would strike Iran in order to boost his popularity ahead of that year’s presidential election. Despite Trump’s predictions, Obama did not attack Iran. Instead, he led world powers to ink a deal with Iran that restricted its ability to produce weapons of mass destruction while lifting harsh economic sanctions. In May, Trump pulled the US out of that agreement. Iran has since begun laying the groundwork to resume production of the radioactive fuel needed to create nuclear weapons. Though European nations are trying to keep the deal’s framework in place, they face difficulties doing so in because of resumed US sanctions . And with Iran’s economy slumping, Rouhani now has incentives to focus his constituents on an abstract foreign enemy. So does Trump. Days before Trump’s Iran tweet, the Department of Justice released to the public a old redacted request to wiretap one of his presidential campaign advisers. National security law experts say the legal documents show compelling probable cause to suspect his advisor, Carter Page, was working for a foreign country. This undermines Trump’s argument that investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election are frivolous or partisan. The day after Trump’s tweet, even more information become public: Twelve audio recordings made by Trump’s personal attorney, Michael Cohen, became available to prosecutors investigating allegations of financial wrong-doing. And five witnesses were granted immunity to testify against Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, who is facing charges of bank fraud and conspiracy. The same day as Trump’s tweet, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also delivered a harsh public indictment of Iran’s leadership, accusing them of using government power to enrich themselves. “The level of corruption and wealth among Iranian leaders shows that Iran is run by something that resembles the mafia more than a government,” Pompeo said. But it’s hard to see how much credence this message will be given on the international stage. Multiple  members  of  Trump’s  own cabinet face ethics investigations. The special counsel inquiry into Trump’s election has so far has led to eight guilty pleas, two convictions and multiple indictments. And the president himself has not released his tax returns or divested himself from his private company, which continues to profit from government business.","https://qz.com/1334536/donald-trump-already-told-us-why-hes-shouting-at-iran/"
"The Iran Nuclear Deal – A Simple Guide","Advertisement  By WILLIAM J. BROAD and  SERGIO PEÇANHA   UPDATED Jan. 15, 2015   Negotiators reached a historic accord last summer to limit Tehran’s nuclear ability in return for lifting international oil and financial sanctions. Here is a guide to the Iran nuclear deal .   An atomic bomb can be made from two types of radioactive materials: uranium or plutonium. The talks were aimed at curbing Iran’s ability to put  these two elements to use in weapons. In each case, the manufacturing starts with uranium ore. Uranium mined from the earth is less than 1 percent  U-235, the isotope that can be used to fuel reactors and make bombs. Centrifuges are needed to separate the U-235 from the rest of the uranium, in a process called enrichment. The other fuel that can be used to make a bomb, plutonium, is made by irradiating uranium in a nuclear reactor. The process transforms some of the uranium into plutonium.  Path 1 Uranium Centrifuges Uranium ore Path 2 Reactor Plutonium Path 1 Uranium Centrifuges Uranium ore Path 2 Reactor Plutonium Uranium ore Centrifuges Reactor Uranium Plutonium  During the enrichment process, centrifuges are used to raise concentrations of U-235. For most power reactors in the West, uranium is enriched up to 5 percent. Bomb grade is above 90 percent and Iran had been processing ore to 20 percent enrichment.  The agreement Iran has agreed to transform its deeply buried plant at Fordo into a center for science research. Another uranium plant, Natanz, is to be cut back rather than shut down. Some 5,000 centrifuges for enriching uranium will remain spinning there, about half the current number.

Iran has also agreed to limit enrichment to 3.7 percent and to cap its stockpile of low-enriched uranium at 300 kilograms, or 660 pounds, for 15 years. That is considered insufficient for a bomb rush.  Uranium ore Centrifuges 90% 20% 3.7% Uranium ore Centrifuges 90% 20% 3.7% Uranium enrichment 90% Uranium ore Centrifuges 20% 3.7%  Iran was constructing a nuclear reactor at Arak that would have used natural uranium to produce Pu-239, which can fuel bombs.  The agreement Iran has agreed to redesign and rebuild the Arak reactor so it will not produce weapons-grade plutonium. The original core of the reactor, which would enable the production of weapons-grade plutonium, will be made inoperable, but will stay in the country. Under the terms of  the deal, the reactor’s spent fuel, which could also be used to produce a bomb, will be shipped out of the country. Iran will not build any additional heavy water reactors for 15 years.  Radiation Arak 238 239 Radiation Arak 238 239 Arak Radiation 238 239  More than twice the size of Texas in area, Iran poses many challenges for atomic inspectors who have to police the agreement and gain access not only to scientists, labs and factories, but also to many underground sites and military bases. Western allies say the new inspections must be far more intrusive than those in the past, given the deal’s sweeping terms as well as Iran’s history of evasions, stonewalling and illicit procurements. The principal concerns are how to detect cheating and covert sites.  The agreement Iran has agreed to provide the International Atomic Energy Agency greater access and information regarding its nuclear program, and to allow the agency to investigate suspicious sites or allegations of covert facilities related to uranium enrichment anywhere in the country. Inspectors will also have access to the supply chain that supports Iran’s nuclear program, including uranium mines and mills, and to continuous surveillance of centrifuge manufacturing and storage facilities.   The deal requires Iran to reduce its current stockpile of low-enriched uranium by 98 percent, and limits Iran’s enrichment capacity and research and development for 15 years. Some inspections and transparency measures will remain in place for as long as 25 years. According to President Obama: “This relief will be phased in. Iran must complete key nuclear steps before it begins to receive sanctions relief.” Sanctions for arms could be lifted in five years, ballistic missiles in eight.   The agreement increases the “breakout” time — the amount of time it would take Iran to produce enough bomb-grade material for a singular nuclear weapon — to at least one year.

"Where do countries stand on the Iran nuclear deal?","Share this article While the Donald Trump administration has been threatening to pull the US out of the Iran nuclear deal, other countries involved in drawing up the 2015 accord have been pulling out all the diplomatic stops to keep Washington on board. Under the deal, Iran agreed to curb its nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief. Officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), it was agreed with the US, the UK, France, China and Russia (the five permanent members of the UN Security Council), as well as Germany. Britain, France and Germany have indicated they will seek to stay in the deal even if the United States withdraws. Here is where the various interested countries stand now. Prime Minister Theresa May spoke with Trump by phone at the weekend. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has gone to Washington on a diplomatic drive to keep the US on side. In an opinion article for the New York Times, Johnson says the UK shares Trump’s concerns over Iran’s “dangerous” actions in the Middle East, its support for terrorist groups, cyberspace behaviour and long-range missile programme. But, he argues, the agreement is the least bad option available — and imposes “handcuffs” on Tehran that have been effective. No deal would “add the possibility of a regional nuclear arms race triggered by Iran dashing for a bomb. That is the scenario which the agreement has helped to prevent,” he writes. The UK’s ambassador to the US has confirmed that London is considering ways of keeping the accord alive, if the US does pull out. “Of course we are looking at all eventualities. My government has said that as long as Iran is in compliance with the deal and wants to stick with it that will be our position as well. So we’re looking at options for maintaining the deal should — which we hope they won’t — should the US administration choose to withdraw,” Sir Kim Darroch told CBS News on Sunday. President Emmanuel Macron has warned that war could ensue if Trump withdraws the US from the deal. “We would open the Pandora’s Box. There could be war,” the French president told the German weekly Der Spiegel. “I don’t think that Donald Trump wants war.” Faced with Trump’s hostility to the current deal, Macron suggested a compromise during his visit to Washington last month. He floated the idea of working towards a new accord — but one which builds upon, rather than ditches, the 2015 measures. He said he agreed with the US president that the current pact was “not sufficient”, adding that a “new deal” should address Iran’s long-term nuclear activity, ballistic missiles and regional influence. More recently, in Australia, the French president repeated that the 2015 accord was a “pillar” for a wider, more global solution. “If we destabilise the whole region because of Iran, we will nourish the next terrorist movements which will be born in the region,” he told Le Journal du Dimanche newspaper. Germany has joined Britain and France in aiming for a separate political agreement — not including Iran, Russia or China — that commits to taking a tougher stance on Iran if this can be agreed with the US State Department. Last week Chancellor Angela Merkel echoed Macron in arguing for the negotiating framework to be broadened. It followed her recent visit to Washington in which she also lobbied Trump directly. Germany's president has joined the chorus calling on the US to stick with the 2015 deal. “It mustn’t be forgotten what could happen if this accord collapsed and if the Middle East began to re-arm,” German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier told ARD television this weekend. As in Berlin, officials in Brussels have been looking at ways of keeping economic ties with Iran intact, to discourage Tehran from taking rash decisions such as leaving the deal in the event of a US withdrawal. Trade has soared since the European Union lifted most of its sanctions on Iran. Mechanisms are being considered to protect European firms doing business with Iran, should they face US legal action if Washington reimposes its own sanctions. This could include reviving a special EU blocking statute developed in the 1990s to shield European companies, but it’s thought such a move might be largely a symbolic step to show Iran that Europe was committed to the deal. The EU, which helped broker the 2015 accord, has promoted the role of international institutions and dialogue in a bid to head off hasty decisions. Foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini has reminded the US and Israel that according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), “Iran has fully complied with its commitments”. The nuclear watchdog has, however, recorded several technical violations by Iran since it began verifications in 2016. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has echoed Trump in describing the 2015 pact as “horrible”, citing Israeli intelligence pointing to the existence of a secret Iranian nuclear weapons programme before 2003. Failure to disclose it, he said, meant that Iran had violated the accord. “Iran lied, big time,” Netanyahu said. He is vehemently opposed to the deal, which he says only halts Iran’s nuclear capability temporarily. Israel is also believed to have nuclear weapons, although it has not confirmed or denied it. Russia has repeatedly said it wants the Iran nuclear deal left intact. On Friday Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Moscow would deem any changes to the deal to be unacceptable. This weekend Russia and China issued a joint statement, reaffirming their “unwavering support for the comprehensive and effective implementation” of the 2015 accord, backing the IAEA’s “essential and independent role” and its findings. Moscow, which has said it believes “no alternative exists” to the nuclear deal, is to host Netanyahu this week. The Israeli prime minister is due to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin. President Hassan Rouhani said on Sunday that Iran would respond to any move by Trump to renege on the 2015 agreement. “We have plans to resist any decision by Trump on the nuclear accord,” he said in a speech broadcast live on state television. The Iranian leader warned that Tehran would revive its nuclear energy programme, and would not be intimidated into limiting its missile power, should the US withdraw. “We will not negotiate with anyone about our weapons and defences, and we will make and store as many weapons, facilities and missiles as we need,” Rouhani said. Iranian leaders have rejected talks on the country’s missile programme, insisting it is defensive. However, some observers believe the Iranian president would be weakened by a US withdrawal. Beset by domestic problems including a poorly-performing economy, Rouhani is also thought to be threatened by hardliners looking to constrain his attempts to open up to the West.

"Trump Takes Aim at Kerry — Again — Ahead of Announcement on Iran Deal","Advertisement Supported by Fact Check By  Linda Qiu WASHINGTON — President Trump is again warning John Kerry, the former secretary of state, to keep out of discussions over whether to remain in the Iran nuclear deal — a decision the White House is expected to announce on Tuesday . John Kerry can’t get over the fact that he had his chance and blew it! Stay away from negotiations John, you are hurting your country! A day earlier, the president accused Mr. Kerry, who helped broker the 2015 nuclear deal, of engaging in “possibly illegal Shadow Diplomacy” — a charge disputed by some legal scholars who say the same characterization could have applied to Mr. Trump when he was a candidate. The United States does not need John Kerry’s possibly illegal Shadow Diplomacy on the very badly negotiated Iran Deal.  He was the one that created this MESS in the first place! The 2015 accord among world powers limited Tehran’s nuclear program in exchange for lifting international sanctions against Iran. A parade of European diplomats have in recent weeks urged the Trump administration not to abandon the agreement. Mr. Kerry has also been trying to save it . He has strategized with Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif of Iran, met with European officials and lobbied members of Congress. Mr. Trump did not specify what was illegal about Mr. Kerry’s actions, and the White House would not comment. But Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer, accused Mr. Kerry of “violating the Logan Act,” adding, “And nobody seems to care.” As The New York Times’s Charlie Savage has previously explained : The Logan Act is a 1799 statute that bars private citizens from interfering with diplomatic relations between the United States and foreign governments. It makes it a felony, punishable by a fine or imprisonment of up to three years, if an American citizen, without government authorization, interacts “with any foreign government or any officer or agent thereof, with intent to influence the measures or conduct of any foreign government or of any officer or agent thereof, in relation to any disputes or controversies with the United States, or to defeat the measures of the United States.” A spokesman for Mr. Kerry declined to comment on Monday on Mr. Trump’s charges of illegality. A statement released by Mr. Kerry’s office said he “stays in touch with his former counterparts around the world just like every previous secretary of state.” “Like America’s closest allies,” the statement said, “he believes it is important that the nuclear agreement, which took the world years to negotiate, remain effective as countries focus on stability in the region.” It appears that whether Mr. Kerry violated the law is a matter of legal interpretation. Since the Iran deal is still in place — as of Monday — Mr. Kerry has not undermined or opposed American foreign policy, said Daniel Rice, a fellow at the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection at Georgetown University. “Because the Trump administration has not yet decided to reimpose sanctions on Iran, the existing nuclear deal framework — and not its repudiation — is currently a ‘measure of the United States,’” Mr. Rice said. “By attempting to salvage the deal, Kerry plainly did not intend to ‘defeat’ a measure of the United States.” But it also depends on exactly what Mr. Kerry said to the foreign officials, said Eric Posner, a law professor at the University of Chicago. “If he has gone further than merely expressing his opinion, and tried to influence the actions of foreign governments by, for example, making promises on behalf of a future Democratic president or Congress, and these promises are credible, there is an arguable Logan Act violation,” Mr. Posner said. The legal scholars interviewed by The Times all stressed that the law is a paper tiger that has never been seriously enforced. (Two said it may be unconstitutional.) Still, the Logan Act has occasionally resurfaced as a political cudgel. While it’s “perfectly plausible” to argue that Mr. Kerry violated the Logan Act, “it’s been violated hundreds of times” with no repercussions, said Michael McConnell, a law professor at Stanford University. Accused violators include Henry A. Wallace , the former vice president who lobbied against the Truman Doctrine; Jane Fonda , the actress who traveled to Hanoi during the Vietnam War; the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson , the civil rights activist who visited Cuba during a presidential campaign against Ronald Reagan; and 47 Republican senators who wrote to the government of Iran in 2015 to oppose the nuclear deal before it was struck. The law resurfaced again last year, when it was revealed that Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump’s first national security adviser, had discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador in late 2016 — before the president’s inauguration. And Mr. Trump himself may have committed the same offense as Mr. Kerry when, during the 2016 campaign, he invited Russia to hack Hillary Clinton’s emails , said Timothy Zick, a law professor at the College of William and Mary. (The suggestion of a Logan Act violation did emerge at the time .) But given that there have been no prosecutions under the Logan Act in its history, scholars said it’s hard to predict whether Mr. Kerry would be convicted — even if a case was brought against him. The Logan Act has “been a dead letter for hundreds of years,” Mr. McConnell said. “Its only function is mischief.” Advertisement","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/07/us/politics/trump-kerry-iran-nuclear-deal-illegal.html"
"Europe faces a choice over Iran: uphold its values or surrender its credibility | View","Share this article The withdrawal of the United States from the Iran nuclear deal framework – known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) – between Iran and the EU/E3+3, and the myopic support for this action received from some regional actors, has potential far-reaching consequences for international peace and security. Europe cannot allow the genie of reckless unilateralism to be unleashed. Since its withdrawal, the hawkish US administration is unremitting in trying to completely shut down the JCPOA, a goal which lies at the heart of its so-called grand strategy on Iran. The fruition of years of intense multilateral diplomacy is now on critical life support. Without effective and timely intervention, the JCPOA will simply die. Farcically, the agreement may expire, exactly because it has worked so well, mainly due to Iran’s faithful compliance and restraint. In fact, the Trump administration was in violation of the terms of the deal since its first day in office. The Office for Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) of the US Treasury Department did not issue a single license; instead, it advised extra due diligence. The ill-intentioned tenor of recurrent uncertainties hindered major businesses and banks from engaging with Iran. To be clear, the US unilateral withdrawal on its own does not kill the JCPOA. However, what does cause even greater alarm is that the party in defiance seeks to also extend its dominance to the Europe and other participants of the agreement. What steps should be taken, in particular by the Europe, to save the patient? First, the principle of international multilateralism must be emphatically reaffirmed. For many historical, political and economic reasons, multilateralism remains core to Europe’s identity and cohesion. The withdrawal from the JCPOA is at the height of Trump’s vociferous assault on multilateralism. Following scrapping the Paris Agreement and moving the US Embassy to Jerusalem, he is now up to a full-fledged trade war, to name a few. Europe cannot allow the genie of reckless unilateralism to be unleashed. Second, Europe must act according to its core values. Ever since the Marshall Plan, transatlantic ties have been a key force of Europe’s trajectory. The US withdrawal from the JCPOA has massively contributed to an unprecedented rift in transatlantic relations. Europe, however, appeared to try to ‘manage’ or ‘tame’ Trump. This approach proved to be futile, as the US President has seldom changed his stance due to consultation with allies in Europe. Even as Europe continues to think strategically and act according to its core values, the reality and magnitude of the damage President Trump inflicts might well lead to irreversible damage. The increasingly volatile situation in the Middle East is only one such example. Europe is faced with a choice. If Europe chooses, during the Trump Administration, to give priority to the transatlantic ties, it risks running against its very own principles and values, and only undermines its sovereignty and credibility. Third, Europe and the remaining parties to the JCPOA must act to preserve the integrity of international law and of the UN. The deal was sealed and became part of international law by the UN Security Council Resolution 2231. Trump’s zeal to nullify Obama’s legacy comes at the cost of undermining the very principle of state responsibility in public international law. Fourth, Europe must highlight the strategic value of the JCPOA for international and regional peace and security. President Trump does not seem to comprehend that killing JCPOA is to the detriment of security for everyone. Policies of bullying and intimidation only increase the likelihood of dangerous counter measures, with the potential to spiral into uncontrollable conflict. The JCPOA, in particular, continues to generate a momentum for engagement and dialogue towards defusing tensions in the Middle East. Europe and other remaining signatories should not give in to policies that are injurious for regional and international peace and security. Fifth, JCPOA’s non-proliferation clause must be upheld. Practically, through the most stringent verification regime in its history, the IAEA has confirmed Iran’s compliance with the JCPOA on eleven separate occasions. Pushing a successful non-proliferation regime towards economic collapse can only lead to disaster. Such actions simply encourage disengagement and, moreover, undermine the credibility and core competencies of the nuclear watchdog, the IAEA. For strategic reasons, Europe and the remaining signatories need to preserve the non-proliferation prominence of the agreement. Sixth, Europe needs to acknowledge and reward Iran’s compliance with the agreement. Iran has been the complaint, not the violator. JCPOA can survive without the singular party in withdrawal, but it cannot endure without Iran. Rather, it is Iran’s trust which needs to be regained. Expressions of commitment are essential and in place. This needs, however, to be complemented by deliverable guarantees of Iranian economic gain, as warranted under JCPOA, and will now require extra and time-bound efforts by Europe and the remaining agreement parties. Iran’s self-restraint to date should not be misinterpreted. Iran cannot be expected to implement an unbalanced deal. In the absence of concrete guarantees and reassurances from Europe and the remaining participants, upon its ongoing preparations, Iran has no choice but to explore its own options to act in accordance to its national interests. The JCPOA is a strategic stabilizer for regional and international peace. But to rescue and preserve its existence, Europe and the remaining signatories must choose cohesive and timely action.

"The skepticism is widespread over leaving the Iran deal","Opinion  Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events  President Trump may have intended to garner praise for his decision to pull out of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, but there is a distinct lack of support for exiting the Iran deal, especially when there is no obvious plan to get to the desired “better deal” now that international sanctions have been lifted and the United States is not standing shoulder-to-shoulder with allies. Britain, France and Germany issued a joint statement , restrained in tone but emphatic in their disagreement with Trump. “Together, we emphasize our continuing commitment to the JCPoA. This agreement remains important for our shared security. We recall that the JCPoA was unanimously endorsed by the UN Security Council in resolution 2231. This resolution remains the binding international legal framework for the resolution of the dispute about the Iranian nuclear program.” Translation: The United States is an international scofflaw, but they are not. They urged Trump not to sanction their companies that are doing business in Iran while these countries adhere to the deal. (“We urge the U.S. to ensure that the structures of the JCPOA (deal) can remain intact and to avoid taking action which obstructs its full implementation by all other parties to the deal.”) If Iran meant to sow discord between the United States and its allies, it succeeded beyond its wildest imagination. Our European allies are now issuing assurances — to Iran. (“Our governments remain committed to ensuring the agreement is upheld, and will work with all the remaining parties to the deal to ensure this remains the case, including through ensuring the continuing economic benefits to the Iranian people that are linked to the agreement.”) American criticism was robust as well. Conservative foreign policy scholar Kori Schake, deputy director-general of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, observes, “I don’t see how this tightens the noose on Iran’s nuclear program or its other dangerous behavior.” To the contrary, she says, “It’ll make it harder for us to get the international cooperation we need. President Trump looks to have narrowed his options to either destroying Iran’s nuclear program or threatening our closest friends and allies with secondary sanctions that’ll start a trade war and accelerate the demise of the dollar as the international holding currency.” Sens. Benjamin L. Cardin (D-Md.), Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) and Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), who all opposed the JCPOA, spoke out against Trump’s move. Cardin wrote , “I voted against the Iran nuclear deal three years ago because I felt it left certain long-term questions about Iran’s enrichment capabilities unanswered. Since it was entered into however, I have worked to ensure there is rigorous enforcement and oversight of the deal. Three years in, Iran is complying with its end of the nuclear bargain, according to international observers and American intelligence officials.” Nevertheless, he warned: President Trump has breathed air into Tehran’s inevitable argument to the international community: We kept our end of the deal, but America is not good for its word and cannot be trusted. It is in fact America who has violated its obligations under the deal. That is a deeply unfortunate and frankly dangerously embarrassing prospect, because Iran is one of the most nefarious actors on the world stage, playing a destabilizing role across the Middle East and proudly carrying the mantle of the greatest nation-state threat to Israel today. . . . In 2015, as President Obama was nearing conclusion of the JCPOA negotiations, I worked with Senator Bob Corker in our capacities as the leaders of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to write the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act. That bill asserted Congress’ right to review any agreements reached as part of the effort to keep Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. INARA passed each chamber of Congress with near unanimous support and brought greater accountability and understanding to the American people about the nuclear deal and why it was in our interests. Donald Trump then became president and sought to make good on his campaign promise to tear up the deal. For months throughout 2017, I worked with then-White House National Security Advisor, General H.R. McMaster, to brainstorm possible changes to [Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act] that would not violate two of my principles: no changes that would have the U.S. violate its JCPOA obligations, and no changes without European concurrence. He might have added that, as has been widely reported, the United States and our allies reached agreement on all issues except the sunset clause. And yet Trump, who had always wanted to scuttle the deal, chose to exit and set in motion reinstitution of sanctions. Cardin notes that “just because he can leave the agreement does not mean he should. Mr. Trump has failed to make a convincing case for U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal and in the process, may very well have strengthened Iran.” As for the voters, they are highly skeptical of Trump’s strategy (if there is one) on backing out of the deal. Reuters reports that “29 percent of adults wanted to end the deal with Iran and five other world powers to ease sanctions and limit Iran’s nuclear program. Another 42 percent said the United States should remain in the deal, and the remaining 28 percent said they ‘don’t know.'” In contrast to most issues, Republicans aren’t cheering the move. “Even among those who are registered as Republicans, less than half — 44 percent — advocated ending the U.S. involvement in the deal. Another 28 percent wanted to remain, and the remaining 28 percent said they did not know.” With GOP support for Trump running above 80 percent , that is practically a mutiny. The predictions and current polls will prove of little value if Trump pulls a rabbit out of the hat, forcing Iran into a much tougher deal. We find that highly unlikely. For now, this is looking like another cheesy stunt gone bad.

"Congress: We Can’t Stop Trump From Killing the Iran Deal","Key lawmakers and Trump officials want to see the accord strengthened but preserved. So far, however, they aren’t willing to stop the president from axing it entirely. Key lawmakers are predicting that President Donald Trump will pull the United States out of the Iran nuclear deal later this spring. And although there is an appetite on Capitol Hill and within Trump’s own national security team  to save the accord, members of Congress say they lack the immediate legislative options to save it from Trump’s axe. The president’s antipathy toward the deal struck by his predecessor is well established, and he has privately vented about a law that requires him to certify every few months that Iran remains in compliance with the terms of the deal. The next deadline to waive nuclear-related sanctions is May 12. And Trump has hinted, if not outwardly threatened, that he will use that moment to effectively pull the U.S. out of the agreement unless European allies agree to stricter terms. Lawmakers may be able to avoid that outcome if they were to pass legislation scrapping the certification requirements. But Democrats seem unwilling to tangle with those requirements as talks about enhancing the deal continue. And Republicans believe that the threat of leaving the deal entirely is needed in order to move European leaders during the negotiations. “There will be no congressional action until there’s a framework [agreed to with the Europeans],” Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN), the chairman of the foreign relations panel, told The Daily Beast. “We’ve let the White House know clearly that the onus is on them to negotiate a framework. If they get a framework done, then we’ll look at domestic language.” Corker isn’t optimistic that such a framework will ever come together. While he believes the White House and the Europeans can agree on new, stricter restrictions when it comes to Iran’s intercontinental ballistic missiles and the frequency of nuclear inspections, the administration’s biggest qualm with the agreement—the so-called “sunset” provisions which allow some limitations on Tehran’s nuclear program to expire—isn’t likely to be re-evaluated. The retiring senator predicted that the European partners—consisting of France, Germany and the United Kingdom—could eventually give up major concessions and move closer to the Trump administration’s position on the deal as the deadline approaches. If that comes together, he reasoned, it could end up saving the Iran accord and allow Congress to change the law requiring presidential certifications every few months. Corker and his counterparts were working on a framework recently that would have moved the certification requirement from 90 days to 180 days. Certification requirements were not part of the initial nuclear accord. Indeed, they were put into place later as lawmakers in the House and Senate sought to force then-President Barack Obama and any future president to essentially re-affirm their support for the agreement a handful of times per year. The resulting Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act (INARA), helmed by Corker, passed overwhelmingly in 2015. Once Trump took office, however, the law took on a new meaning. Instead of forcing the president to stand by the nuclear accord, it became a pressure point for Trump to pull out of the deal altogether. Trump’s national security team, which has been wary of abandoning the deal, has since encouraged lawmakers to scrap the certification provision. Other foreign policy observers believe that eliminating those requirements would allow the U.S. to quietly remain within the deal, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), and give additional peace of mind to the deal’s other partners. “The most essential thing for stability in the nuclear agreement is eliminating the waivers in congressional legislation that cause drama every three to four months with the president,” said Ilan Goldenberg, the director of the Middle East security program at the Center for New American Security, and a former aide to John Kerry at the State Department. “Democrats and the Europeans want this to be the last time we have this drama, which you only do by getting rid of the waivers and the certification.” Even senators who initially opposed the deal believe the U.S. is better served to remain in the agreement, especially as the administration prepares for a possible summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. But they’re not willing to step in legislatively to get rid of the presidential waiver and certification requirements until they have proper assurances from the Europeans that such changes to existing law wouldn’t violate the terms of the JCPOA. “The only reason to do any INARA work would be if there are things that would actually get the president to stay in the deal,” Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told The Daily Beast. “I believe they should actually use the leverage which I think the administration inadvertently created by saying he wants to move away from the deal,” Menendez, a longtime Iran deal skeptic, said. “That’s leverage you could use with the Europeans to get them to join us in multilateral actions outside of the nuclear portfolio, and to get them to bring Iran to the table to deal with the sunset issues.” Trump has quietly and reluctantly issued those waivers and certifications a handful of times throughout his presidency—and the White House said the January waiver was the final one the president would sign. At the time, Trump said the onus was on the Europeans to “fix the terrible flaws,” or else the U.S. would pull out of the deal. Lawmakers who have been briefed on those negotiations don’t expect them to be fruitful. “Right now, in the discussions between Europe and the White House, I think they’re having difficulty because some of the things the president’s asking for is more than Europe is prepared to [give],” Sen. Ben Cardin (D-MD), who previously served as the ranking member of the foreign relations committee, told The Daily Beast. While Corker had been working behind the scenes with national security adviser H.R. McMaster to preserve the deal, his Republican colleagues appear comfortable with walking away from it. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), one of the Senate’s most strident Iran hawks, has been pushing for new sanctions and other restrictions on Iran outside of the nuclear framework. “The current deal is terrible. The sunset clause is a joke. It’s going to lead to a nuclear arms race in the Middle East,” Graham told The Daily Beast. “And if the Europeans and the Russians and the Chinese don’t help us get a better deal, then I think the president should withdraw.” McMaster, along with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary James Mattis, have argued to the president that it would be better for the U.S. to stay in the deal—but with Tillerson soon to be gone from that role and McMaster possibly following him out the door, lawmakers worry that the president will have fewer people around him encouraging him to remain in the JCPOA. “Trying to predict what will affect the president’s behavior is very difficult,” Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in an interview. “If you pull out of the deal, I think our allies are going to peel off from us and the U.S. will have broken the coalition.”","https://www.thedailybeast.com/congress-we-cant-stop-trump-from-killing-the-iran-deal"

"Europe should strike a tough pose with Trump on the Iran nuclear deal","Ellie Geranmayeh  @EllieGeranmayeh  22nd March, 2018  Europeans should toughen their position in ongoing talks with the Trump administration if they are to preserve the Iran nuclear deal and limit insecurity in the Middle East. France, the United Kingdom, and Germany (the ‘E3’) appear set to intensify ongoing talks with the US in an effort to convince Donald Trump to stick to the Iran nuclear deal. Trump has threatened to withdraw from the agreement in May unless certain preconditions were met. Europeans hope the ongoing discussions will be able to find a middle way to both safeguard the nuclear deal and address outstanding areas of concern with Iran, such as on missiles and regional issues. However, Trump’s recent nomination of Mike Pompeo as US secretary of state increases the risk that this approach will backfire on Europe. European policymakers largely viewed Rex Tillerson as a voice of moderation within the White House and as someone who, together with secretary of defence James Mattis, influenced Trump towards a more pragmatic position on Iran. If Europe is serious about saving the nuclear deal, then the appointment of Pompeo, an Iran-hawk in Washington , should serve as an urgent prompt to rethink its current strategy. Some in European policy circles hoped that Trump’s statement on the nuclear deal on 12 January this year was part of his maximalist negotiating tactics, and that if Europe showed some flexibility, the president would be climb down from these demands. But one of the reasons Trump cited when firing Tillerson was their disagreement over the Iran nuclear deal. This should indicate that the moderate voices in the White House have been unable to bridge gaps between Trump and Europe over the nuclear deal. Trump, meanwhile, remarked on the “ very similar thought process ” he and Pompeo share on a number of issues. Pompeo has been especially outspoken on Iran: he opposed the nuclear deal, supported regime change, and downplayed the costs of war with Iran. With Pompeo now in charge of US diplomacy, Europeans are likely to face a tougher and non-accommodating negotiating posture from the Trump administration over the nuclear deal. This comes against a backdrop of rising regional tensions between Iran and Israel , in addition to repeated pledges from Trump to confront Iran, most recently in his Nowruz message marking the Iranian new year. Trump’s deal-making during his term in office should create doubt as to whether he would actually implement a side framework agreement of the type that his administration is currently seeking to strike with Europe over Iran policy. On foreign policy matters, Trump has remained dangerously unpredictable, and threatened everything from trade war to nuclear war. The pattern of negotiations between his administration and the US Congress over immigration and healthcare suggests that, even if Trump’s counterparts make concessions to fulfil his demands, there is no guarantee that he will, in the end, accept it. At least in private, Europe should be devising a Plan B and stress its willingness to pursue alternative options to preserve the nuclear agreement if Trump withdraws in the coming weeks Europeans should therefore be clear-eyed about the chances of success of current talks with the United States. Based on recent precedent, Trump is likely to perceive Europe’s flexibility and accommodation over Iran policy as a weakness that he can exploit to raise the benchmarks of demands. Moreover, by threatening imminent withdrawal from the nuclear deal, Trump is increasingly pressuring the E3 to jump on board with his efforts to undermine the agreement. Republican lawmakers such as Senator Bob Corker have also adopted this stance and warned that, unless the E3 sign up to the side framework agreement that meets US demands, Trump is unlikely to extend sanctions waivers due in May. Yet, in their attempt to save the nuclear agreement through reaching a broader understanding with the Trump administration on Iran policy, the E3 must ensure that Europe does not become complicit in hollowing out the nuclear agreement. So far, the International Atomic Energy Agency has repeatedly verified that Iran is fulfilling its nuclear-related obligations. However, Iran has firmly indicated it will take reciprocal action to match any US backtracking from the deal. A potential side agreement between the E3 and the US with respect to the nuclear deal therefore risks a tit-for-tat exchange between Tehran and Washington that could alter and muddy their respective commitments under the agreement and cumulatively cause it to unravel. In light of Pompeo’s appointment, the E3 should harden their negotiating tactics on the nuclear deal in ways that match the mindset of the Trump administration. First, Europeans should take a unified and more assertive position in forthcoming talks with the US to underscore that they will not be party to, nor accept as permissible, violations of a multilateral and United Nations Security Council-enshrined agreement. The E3 should continue to outline that it will not, and indeed cannot, alter expiration dates of the terms in the nuclear deal (so-called “sunset provisions”) as Trump has demanded. If Trump wants to kill the deal, he must take full responsibility, and Europe should avoid guilt by association. Second, Europe should continue to show openness to working with the US administration on a follow-up to the nuclear agreement with Iran once the current deal has reached a more mature stage of implementation. The E3 should also have a candid exchange with Iran on regional security and demonstrate to the Trump administration that a range of tools exists to address concerns related to Iran. But in return for this flexibility, Europeans should outline an expectation that Washington will adhere to its existing obligations under the multilateral agreement and minimise the unpredictability surrounding Trump’s waivers of sanctions. A firm European position in defence of the diplomatic accord may reduce the growing risk of confrontation between Washington and Tehran in the Middle East, for which Europe will inevitably bear the cost The sequencing of European measures and flexibility will be important to strengthening the E3’s position. For example, the European Union should first receive firm assurances that Trump will waive nuclear-related sanctions in May before it even debates the tougher measures against Iran’s missiles programme proposed by the US and reportedly supported by the E3 during a meeting with EU foreign ministers on Monday this week. The E3 should also consider how political and legislative measures within the US could better guarantee US commitments to the nuclear deal. This could entail extensions in the length of time between each waiver of US secondary sanctions related to Iran’s nuclear programme (thereby easing the unpredictability surrounding Trump’s actions), and pressing for progress in the Airbus aviation deals with Iran explicitly permitted under the nuclear deal. Third, Europeans should prepare for the worst-case scenario – namely, a US withdrawal from the agreement and snap-back sanctions in May – and minimise the damage that will ensue. Pompeo’s appointment should be a trigger for European policymakers and companies to step up contingency planning to salvage the deal even without the US. For Iran to continue implementing the restrictions on its nuclear programme, there must be a degree of political and economic incentives. As outlined elsewhere , Europe could provide this package to Iran by using a range of political and technical tools that ring-fence companies from the enforcement of US secondary sanctions through legal carve-outs, sector-specific exemptions, political understandings, and reviving the EU Blocking Regulation. In current talks with the US, Europe should privately stress its willingness to pursue alternative options to preserve the nuclear agreement. A significant benefit of outlining a contingency plan at this stage is the deterrence impact it may have on Trump’s decision to kill the deal through highlighting the isolation the US would face. In short, Europe should outline, as it has done on the issue of trade and the Paris climate accord, that it will work with like-minded coalitions to fill the gaps left by US withdrawal. This strategy may not, in the end, alter the decision by Trump to execute his campaign promise to “dismantle” the “disastrous deal” with Iran. But this approach at least provides Europe with the political capital to try to salvage the agreement and thereby secure its own non-proliferation goals. If Iran’s nuclear programme expands in respond to Trump’s withdrawal, other regional powers, such as Saudi Arabia, have warned that they will do the same. A firm European position in defence of the diplomatic accord may also reduce the growing risk of confrontation between Washington and Tehran in the Middle East, for which Europe will inevitably bear the cost. This approach also sets a precedent that Europe is a credible international partner, demonstrating political willingness to safeguard international norms at a time when global leadership is lacking.

"Leaving the Iran Nuclear Deal Will Have Unintended Consequences","Shadow Government:  Leaving the Iran Nuclear Deal Will Have Unintended Consequences  Leaving the Iran Nuclear Deal Wil...  President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw the United States from the Iran nuclear deal and reinstate all U.S. sanctions won’t deliver punishing economic pressure capable of forcing Iran to submit to Washington’s policy demands. Along with diplomatic furor and a blow to nuclear arms control, the move also comes with damning unintended economic consequences for the United States. The new U.S. policy involves snapping back all the sanctions on Iran that were removed in 2016 under the deal. Primary among them are the sanctions on Iran’s central bank and on its oil trade, the engine of the country’s economy. Administration officials are betting that foreign firms that have invested in Iran and buy its oil will abide by the sanctions. They will also fan out around the globe to try to pressure foreign countries into joining the United States with measures of their own. Presumably the White House thinking is that the Iranian regime, once backed up against the wall, will capitulate or crumble. This scenario is unlikely. Not every foreign company, bank, or oil trader will be inclined to comply with U.S. sanctions, particularly if their own governments are frustrated with the U.S. re-imposition of sanctions. There is no multilateral interest now in targeting Iran with financial pressure and diplomatic isolation, unlike during the 2012 to 2015 period of most intensive global sanctions on Iran. Even when foreign firms are inclined to comply, many will be confused about how to do so. Explaining the rules to foreign banking associations, chambers of commerce, foreign financial and commercial regulators, and central banks takes an army of U.S. diplomats. The Trump administration has hollowed out the State Department’s ranks, and the department did away with its sanctions implementation office last year. Several key senior staff members at the Treasury Department, which is responsible for crafting and enforcing the sanctions, just resigned. To be sure, some purchasers of Iranian oil will wind down their business to escape legal liability and out of grudging loyalty to the United States, a security ally. European refiners, which buy more than 500,000 barrels per day, will probably unhappily follow the U.S. sanctions rules. Japanese and South Korean purchasers, which together account for more than 500,000 barrels per day, will too. Even here, though, the effects may be delayed or softened as countries seek temporary waivers or exemptions. But Iran’s biggest oil purchasers, China and India, may be less inclined to cooperate. They might even find opportunities to purchase additional barrels of oil from Iran, which has been pushing out more supplies in recent months. This could meaningfully diminish the effect of the sanctions. When it comes to foreign banks and traders severing financial relationships and trade in goods with Iran, compliance will also be a mixed bag. European and Asian firms of any meaningful size will not tolerate the risk of violating sanctions and will stop dealing with sanctioned entities. These institutions, however, were already risk-averse and had minimized their exposure to Iran, so the effect of the new sanctions will be marginal at best. Meanwhile, some foreign banks insulated from U.S. jurisdiction could create bespoke facilities to sustain trade with Iran, even if they are hit with sanctions. There is precedent for this in China. More generally, these broad new Iran sanctions will encourage some countries to explore an array of alternative financial conduits to Iran, from barter to blockchain, to shield their banks and companies from U.S. jurisdiction. Russia and China are already pioneering alternative payment systems to stay outside of U.S. banks and currency, and these measures will likely accelerate that work and international interest. European leaders are threatening to push back re-imposition of U.S. sanctions, guaranteeing a path for their companies to sustain business with Iran. They are exploring a revival of blocking statutes that ban European companies from complying with U.S. sanctions, measures that during the Bill Clinton presidency helped undermine the effect of U.S. Iran sanctions. However, these European Union leaders ultimately cannot tell private companies how to operate and force them to tempt the U.S. Treasury’s sanctions enforcement team. Chinese and Indian political officials are no doubt also considering how to continue some oil business with Iran in defiance of the United States. And Iranian and independent oil smugglers are dusting off their old playbooks for moving Iranian crude. During the prior period of intensive global sanctions on the country, smugglers mislabeled Iranian crude cargoes, blended Iranian crude with other regional grades, and engaged in ship-to-ship transfers to disguise its origin. Unfortunately, smugglers were very good at this activity then and show evidence of sophisticated evolution over time. They learned from the Iran sanctions of the 1990s that U.S. pressure can practically shut down foreign oil and gas exploration and production in Iran, but it has limitations that can be exploited when it comes to rules against trading petroleum, condensate, refined product, and petrochemicals. This energy trading will probably be enough to enable Iran’s resistance economy to soldier on, though not to achieve marked growth. Iran is no Venezuela, which will no doubt see more of its barrels disappear from the market this year than Iran will, as President Nicolás Maduro drives Venezuela toward total economic collapse. Now, there will be far more opportunities to cheat if the rest of the world does not cooperate with the U.S. sanctions. That lack of cooperation will make it harder to enforce the sanctions. Foreign partners may not collect or share intelligence on evasion with U.S. government analysts as they did in the past under a multilateral sanctions framework. They also may stand in the way of efforts to enforce sanctions by impeding U.S. official access to violators to try to convince them to desist. This slow-rolling tactic to stymie U.S. sanctions enforcement would actually be a smaller problem for the United States than the lack of foreign cooperation to match U.S. sanctions in the EU and other jurisdictions. Prior sanctions on Iran were as forceful as they were because they were multilateral and involved the strong will of foreign counterparts to join the effort. Some of the most powerful oil import restrictions and the cutoff of Iran from SWIFT, the global financial payments messaging system, came from the EU, not the United States. Now, U.S. allies have sanctions fatigue (to say nothing of their tariff woes) and are fed up with the United States bullying them and their companies. As an example, sanctions on Russia that the United States rolled out last month roiled financial markets, spiked the price of aluminum, and squeezed supply chains around the world. In the face of distress and outrage from businesspeople from Munich to Seoul to Hong Kong, the U.S. Treasury had to back off. Firms in the same countries, many of whom are allies, would also be hemmed in with the Iran measures. This picture does not bode well for the strength of U.S. sanctions. Beyond this challenge, the sanctions involve serious unintended consequences that will make life more expensive and less safe for U.S. citizens. To begin with, the announcement of sanctions drove up oil prices and may continue to apply upward pressure as the conditions for the new oil penalties become clearer over the next 180 days. Higher oil prices translate into higher gasoline prices for U.S. consumers right as the country enters the summer driving season, which already puts pressure on fuel stocks and prices. Another unintended consequence of the sanctions is that they give Russia and Saudi Arabia more clout as alternative oil suppliers to fill the gap left by Iran as customers wind down their contracts. This arrangement directly empowers and enriches Russia, giving it a greater ability to support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s bloody campaign against his citizens, and to undermine U.S. democratic institutions with misinformation and malicious cyber activities. By enriching Moscow and its oil companies, the new Iran sanctions also undermine U.S. sanctions on Russia, a stark example of U.S. policy working at cross purposes. Both Russia and Saudi Arabia have an interest in exercising their influence to keep oil prices fairly high to break even on their enormous burdens of state spending. Also, ahead of the pending public offering of the Saudi state oil company Aramco, high oil prices are an excellent way to pump up company value. As a further unintended consequence, the new Iran sanctions introduce a major source of tension into the U.S.-China relationship. China is the largest consumer of Iranian crude and probably the only one with the scale of economy and political will necessary to sustain trading of Iranian oil even if an offending Chinese importer or bank is slapped with sanctions penalties. China’s potential to not comply with sanctions is a new lever over the United States that it could pull if Beijing decides to engage in a power struggle with Washington. The most strategically significant unintended economic consequence of the new sanctions, however, is that these measures may ultimately weaken the strength of sanctions as a tool of U.S. statecraft. Limited or uneven compliance with the sanctions will contribute to the impression that sanctions do not work, which will make countries less likely to heed them in the future. In turn, this will make this tool of U.S. foreign policy less cogent and less useful to U.S. leaders not just to counter Iran, but against all security threats. This would be devastating to the Trump administration, which has made maximum-pressure financial sanctions a cornerstone of an array of foreign-policy files, from Iran to North Korea to Venezuela and even now to Russia, in a reversal from its early interest in rolling back Russia sanctions. It will also be damaging to future presidents, shrinking the tools available to project U.S. strength and leadership internationally. Ultimately, this unintended legacy of the present reversal in Iran policy may be among the gravest and most debilitating for U.S. national security.

"Bill Clinton Once Struck a Nuclear Deal With North Korea","President Bill Clinton took the podium on October 18, 1994, with a speech that reads like a sigh of relief—the announcement of a landmark nuclear agreement between the United States and North Korea . “This agreement is good for the United States, good for our allies, and good for the safety of the entire world,” he assured the nation. Called the Agreed Framework, it was designed to put the brakes on North Korea’s nuclear program , and it promised to put an end to years of increasing nuclear tension, including a near war, to a halt. “This agreement represents the first step on the road to a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula,” Clinton said. “It does not rely on trust.” In exchange for North Korea ending its nuclear weapons program, the United States agreed to normalize relations with the nation—and both agreed to pursue “formal assurances” not to use nukes against one another. The agreement—forged against all odds in an environment of fear and worry—seemed bulletproof. So why did it fail just a few years later? The reasons why are rooted in behind-the-scenes negotiations and international mistrust. North Korea had been preparing for nuclear war since the Cold War , when the USSR began to train North Korean scientists to build nuclear weapons. As part of the Communist bloc, North Korea was closely aligned with the USSR, and Moscow provided the technology, training and even geological surveys that helped North Korea locate local deposits of graphite and uranium ore that could be used to create nuclear weapons. According to Derek Bolton, who works with the national security think tank American Security Project, North Korea was well on its way to a nuclear weapons program by the 1960s, and had conducted successful experiments with fission, the underlying chemical phenomenon that can cause a nuclear reaction, under the supervision of the USSR as early as 1963. Over the years, North Korea tried to find more support for its nuclear program, includingengaging South Korea in talks about whether the two countries should develop a joint nuclear weapon in secret. (South Korea declined.) But it took until the 1980s for the world to realize that North Korea might be serious about building nukes—and to recognize that it might be closer to nuclear weapons than previously thought. A1992 file photo showing missiles marching in the North Korean People’s forces’ 60th anniversary parade. (Credit: Jiji Press/KNS/AFP/Getty Images) Despite its apparent commitment to developing nuclear weapons, North Korean leader Kim Il Sung did ratify the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in 1985. The international treaty, which was designed to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, had been in force since 1970, but North Korea had lagged behind other nations like the United States. Now that North Korea was on board, though, it also began mining uranium and producing plutonium—both critical to the production of nuclear weapons—and creating nuclear reactors during the 1980s. Then, in 1989, the Soviet Union fell, leaving North Korea increasingly isolated. “With the collapse of the Soviet Union, North Korea lost its main protector,” Georgetown University professor Keir Leiber told Vox ’s Zack Beauchamp. “What does it have that can counter conventional US power? The answer is obvious: nuclear weapons.” That same year, the U.S. discovered Kim Il Sung’s covert nuclear program using satellite imagery, and North Korea kept developing weapons even afteragreeing with South Korea not to test or manufacture nukes. As a result, the International Atomic Energy Agency, an autonomous nuclear oversight organization that reports directly to the United Nations , asked to conduct inspections of North Korean nuclear sites in 1992 and 1993. North Korea refused, and threatened to back out of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. This represented a double crisis for then-President Clinton. Republicans in Congress pressured him not to negotiate with North Korea, but the international community and Democrats argued that engagement was the only solution. Meanwhile, North Korea escalated its rhetoric, telling the United States that North Korea would turn Seoul into “a sea of flames” if the U.S. pursued sanctions through the United Nations.

(Credit: Korean Central News Agency/AP Photo) The U.S. considered military intervention, but also sent Jimmy Carter to Pyongyang to meet with Kim Il Sung. Carter convinced Kim to start nuclear talks—but the day negotiations were supposed to begin, Kim died. He was succeeded by his son, Kim Jong Il , the very man who founded the most controversial nuclear complex in North Korea, a facility in Yongbyon. Things looked grim, but Clinton became increasingly convinced that direct negotiations were the only way. However, American negotiators doubted from the start that diplomacy would work. “The initial contacts were to test the proposition that we could address their security concerns by getting them to give up their nuclear weapons,” Robert Gallucci, the chief negotiator, told Beyond Parallel in a 2016 interview. “It was not so much of a conviction on anybody’s part…It was possibly true, and worth testing.” For 16 months, Gallucci and his team conducted intense negotiations with North Korea. The countries locked horns on what it would take for North Korea to stop producing nukes. Finally, they came to an agreement—the Agreed Framework. Just four pages long, the agreement said that North Korea would shut down its main nuclear reactor in Yongbyon, abandon two others, and seal fuel that could potentially be used to create a nuclear weapon. In exchange, the U.S. would provide oil to make up for the fuel lost from the dismantled plants and would build two new “light fuel” plants from which it would be harder to extract nuclear materials. If North Korea did try to get fuel out of the new plants, it would be easy for nuclear watchdogs to identify—and hard to hide. In addition, the agreement promised that the U.S. would lift economic sanctions and its diplomatic freeze on North Korea and agree that it would not use nuclear weapons of its own on North Korea.

(Credit: Marcy Nighswander/Getty Images) On the surface, it looked like the U.S. was offering huge concessions to North Korea in exchange for few assurances. But behind the scenes, the Clinton administration thought that North Korea was on the verge of collapse and likely wouldn’t last long enough for the U.S. to build the agreed-upon reactors. In North Korea, the agreement wasn’t taken seriously. Isolated, impoverished and headed by a leader who believed nuclear power would give the country power on the international stage, North Korea had little motivation to give up its program. Clinton knew the agreement would be hugely controversial—so he structured it in a way that ensured it wouldn’t have to be ratified by the Senate. Republicans were infuriated. And shortly after the agreement was signed, the Republicans won control of Congress. They grilled Gallucci. “It was pretty harsh,” he told PBS in 2003. “We did not get ticker tape parades, as it turned out.” Congress made it clear that they would not agree to actually fund the implementation of the project or sanction formal peace agreements between the two countries. Meanwhile, North Korea continued producing uranium. Kim Jong Il, it turned out, had used potential nukes as a bargaining chip—even though he had no intention of stopping the program. Despite promising initial results, North Korea began flouting the agreement more and more. North Korea ignored warnings that the agreement was in jeopardy and soon intelligence agencies realized it possessed much more advanced nuclear tech than the U.S. had suspected. At first it seemed like George W. Bush , who took office in 2001, might continue Clinton-era diplomatic policies toward North Korea. But then things fell apart. Bush’s diplomats stopped sending fuel shipments; North Korea complained bitterly that the promised nuclear reactors had never been built. And when the September 11 terrorist attacks happened, it pushed American diplomacy in other directions—and Bush mentioned North Korea as one of the three countries in his “Axis of Evil” State of the Union Speech in 2002. Soon, relations between the two countries were openly tense, if not hostile. North Korea dropped out of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 2003. By 2006, it had conducted its first nuclear test—an underground delivery that may have been a fizzle, or unsuccessful explosion. And though Bill Clinton himself headed to North Korea to successfully negotiate the release of two American hostages in 2009, it was too late to halt North Korea’s march toward nukes. Though the United States continues to try to seek solutions to North Korea’s potential nukes, including the potential of talks between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un, Clinton’s vision of an end to nuclear proliferation on the Korean Peninsula now seems more like a mirage.

"Behind Trump’s Termination of Iran Deal Is a Risky Bet","Advertisement Supported by News Analysis By  David E. Sanger and David D. Kirkpatrick WASHINGTON — For President Trump and two of the allies he values most — Israel and Saudi Arabia — the problem of the Iranian nuclear accord was not, primarily, about nuclear weapons. It was that the deal legitimized and normalized Iran’s clerical government, reopening it to the world economy with oil revenue that financed its adventures in Syria and Iraq, its missile program and its support of terrorist groups. Now, by announcing on Tuesday that he is exiting the nuclear deal and will reimpose economic sanctions on Iran and companies around the world that do business with the country, Mr. Trump is engaged in a grand, highly risky experiment. Mr. Trump and his Middle East allies are betting they can cut Iran’s economic lifeline and thus “break the regime,” as one senior European official described the effort. In theory, America’s withdrawal could free Iran to produce as much nuclear material as it wants — as it was doing five years ago, when the world feared that it was headed toward a bomb. But Mr. Trump’s team dismisses that risk: Iran does not have the economic strength to confront the United States, Israel and Saudi Arabia. And Iran knows that any move to produce a weapon would only provide Israel and the United States with a rationale for taking military action. It is a brutally realpolitik approach that America’s allies in Europe have warned is a historic mistake, one that could lead to confrontation, and perhaps to war. And it is a clear example of Middle East brinkmanship that runs counter to what President Barack Obama intended when the nuclear deal was struck in July 2015. Mr. Obama’s gamble in that deal — the signature foreign policy accord of his eight years in office — was straightforward. He regarded Iran as potentially a more natural ally of the United States than many of its Sunni-dominant neighbors, with a young, educated Western-oriented population that is tired of being ruled by an aging theocracy. By taking the prospect of nuclear weapons off the table, the Obama administration had argued, the United States and Iran could chip away at three decades of hostility and work on common projects, starting with the defeat of the Islamic State. It did not turn out that way. While the deal succeeded in getting 97 percent of Iran’s nuclear material out of the country, Iran’s conservatives and its military recoiled at the idea of cooperating on any projects with the West. Months before it became clear that Mr. Trump had a decent shot at being elected, the Iranian military increased support for President Bashar al-Assad in Syria; it expanded its influence in Iraq and accelerated its support for terrorist groups. And it doubled down on deploying cyberattacks against targets in the West and in Saudi Arabia, embracing a weapon that was not covered by the nuclear accord. Then came Mr. Trump, with his declaration that the deal was a “disaster” and his vow to dismantle it. That is exactly what he has now done, but at a huge cost. Moments after he delivered his statement — in which he made it sound as if Iran was cheating on the accord, even though his intelligence chiefs have testified otherwise — Mr. Trump received a stinging rebuke from Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain, President Emmanuel Macron of France and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany. The three leaders, America’s closest European allies, essentially rejected his logic. They noted that the United Nations Security Council resolution that embraced the Iran deal in 2016 “remains the binding international legal framework for the resolution of the dispute about the Iranian nuclear program.” That was polite diplomatic language for the stark conclusion that it is the United States — not Iran — that first violated the accord. And now, suddenly, the world may well be headed back to where it was in 2012: on a road to uncertain confrontation, with “very little evidence of a Plan B,” as Boris Johnson, the British foreign minister, said on a visit to Washington. Exiting the deal, with or without a plan, is fine with the Saudis. They see the accord as a dangerous distraction from the real problem of confronting Iran around the region — a problem that Saudi Arabia believes will be solved only by leadership change in Iran. The Saudis have an ally in John R. Bolton, the president’s new national security adviser, who had made clear before taking office that he shared their view. Mr. Obama’s deal, Mr. Bolton said on Tuesday afternoon, featured “an utterly inadequate treatment of the military dimension of Iran’s aspirations.” The Saudi case against Iran has been bolstered in recent months by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has repeatedly referred to Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, as “the new Hitler.” “Many countries around the world and in Europe did not realize how dangerous Hitler was until what happened, happened,” Prince Mohammed said in a recent interview with the CBS News program “60 Minutes.” “I don’t want to see the same events happening in the Middle East.” In a speech in March at the Brookings Institution, Adel al-Jubeir, the Saudi foreign minister, asserted that Iran was “the biggest problem we face in our region.” He blamed Iran for interfering in neighboring countries, backing allied armed groups in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, Yemen and elsewhere, and supplying Yemeni rebels with ballistic missiles they fired at his country. Even if its restrictions on nuclear weapons were tightened and extended, “the agreement by itself does not solve the problem of Iran,” Mr. Jubeir said. “Iran must be held accountable.” Jeremy Shapiro, research director at the European Council on Foreign Relations and a State Department official during the Obama administration, argued that the nuclear deal’s opposition from Saudi Arabia, Israel and other regional players was primarily about its effects on American politics and policy. “They believe they are in this existential conflict with the Iranian regime, and nuclear weapons are a small part of that conflict” — but the one that most influences public opinion in the United States, Mr. Shapiro said. “If the deal opened an avenue for better relations between the United States and Iran, that would be a disaster for the Saudis,” he said. “They need to ensure a motivation for American pressure against Iran that will last even after this administration.” Israel is a more complicated case. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has pressed Mr. Trump to abandon an arrangement that the Israeli leader has always detested. But Mr. Netanyahu’s own military and intelligence advisers say Israel is far safer with an Iran whose pathway to a bomb is blocked, rather than one that is once again pursuing the ultimate weapon. “The individuals who shoulder responsibility for Israel’s survival and security have been crystal clear,” Graham Allison, a Harvard professor who has spent his career examining cases of nuclear proliferation. “This will most likely lead to an outcome that is much worse not only for the U.S., but for Israel,’’ Mr. Allison said, because the current agreement rolled Iran’s nuclear program back a decade “and imposed on Iran the most intrusive inspection regime ever negotiated.” But Mr. Netanyahu holds Israel’s bullhorn, and he used it last week to persuade Mr. Trump to pull the plug on the Iran deal. By releasing Iranian documents, stolen from Tehran in January, Mr. Netanyahu proved what Western intelligence agencies long knew: A decade ago or even longer, the Iranians were working hard to design a nuclear warhead. To Mr. Netanyahu, this was proof that Iran could never be trusted and that it had reached the nuclear deal under false pretenses by pretending it never had a weapons program. To Mr. Trump and his allies, the Israeli discovery said less about Iranian nuclear capability than it did about Iranian perfidy. Given evidence that Iran was preserving its bomb designs as a hedge for the future, the discovery suggested it has not given up its ambitions. As Dennis Ross, a former Middle East negotiator, put it, someone needed to address the Israeli discovery “lest they give the Iranians the ability to pick up quickly where they left off on weaponizing.” Still, at the core of Mr. Trump’s announcement on Tuesday is a conviction that Mr. Obama made a critical mistake in agreeing to a deal that contains an expiration date. Mr. Trump’s argument is that Iran can never be allowed to accumulate enough material to assemble a bomb. So when the Europeans said that would require reopening the negotiations, Mr. Trump balked, and decided instead to scrap the entire deal. It was a classic Trumpian move, akin to the days when he would knock down New York buildings to make way for visions of grander, more glorious edifices. But in this case, it is about upsetting a global power balance and weakening a government that Mr. Trump has argued, since he began campaigning, must go.

"","During the 2016 campaign, President Donald Trump repeatedly claimed to have seen video of the U.S. handing over $400 million in cash to the Iranian government, though his campaign conceded that footage does not exist. | Evan Vucci/AP Photo By LOUIS NELSON President Donald Trump on Thursday slammed the Obama administration over a waiver it issued that would have allowed the Iranian government to briefly route money through a U.S. bank, suggesting that special counsel Robert Mueller include the revelation in his current investigation. “The Obama Administration is now accused of trying to give Iran secret access to the financial system of the United States. This is totally illegal,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “Perhaps we could get the 13 Angry Democrats to divert some of their energy to this ‘matter’ (as Comey would call it). Investigate!” Story Continued Below The waiver, discovered by congressional Republicans investigating the Iran nuclear deal, was issued in early 2016 as a means of allowing the Iranian government to access newly unfrozen funds from an Omani bank by converting them first to U.S. dollars and then to Euros. The waiver’s existence was first reported by The Associated Press. Republicans have argued that the waiver violated an Obama administration promise that Iran would not have access to U.S. financial markets, while former officials from the Obama administration have countered that the one-time waiver was within the spirit of the Iran deal and did not rise to the level of allowing the Iranians access to American financial systems.

Trump railed for months against the Iran deal and officially pulled out of the deal earlier this year over concerns about the deal’s framework and its failure to address Iran’s non-nuclear behavior, including its funding of groups that the U.S. has identified as terrorist organizations. During the 2016 campaign, the president repeatedly claimed to have seen video of $400 million in cash being handed over from the U.S. to the Iranian government, even though his campaign conceded that no such footage exists. Trump has also long complained about Mueller’s probe, referring to the investigators as a group of “13 angry Democrats” even though Mueller is a registered Republican. The Iran deal would fall well outside the purview of Mueller’s investigation, which is tasked with examining Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 election as well as allegations that the Trump campaign colluded in those efforts. The president’s dig at former FBI Director James Comey is a reference to the bureau’s 2016 investigation of Democrat Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server when she was secretary of state. Comey took the unusual step of holding a news conference to announce he would recommend that Clinton, then a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, not face charges. Comey later said that then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch instructed him to refer to the Clinton investigation as a “matter,” a directive that he later said “gave me a queasy feeling.” Missing out on the latest scoops?

"Trump scraps the Iran nuclear deal. Now what?","President Donald Trump's decision to reimpose sanctions on Iran — violating the Obama-era nuclear deal — leaves the other nations involved scrambling to salvage the pact. Experts warned it also risks weakening trust in the United States, raising questions about whether Washington can be taken at its word, and could potentially bolster hard-liners in Tehran who are pushing an agenda of Middle East aggression. Trump has called it the “worst deal ever negotiated” and wanted Britain, France and Germany — co-signatories, along with Russia, China and the European Union — to toughen up its terms. In announcing his decision Tuesday, Trump blasted the deal as "defective at its core," later adding that "America will not be held hostage to nuclear blackmail." His primary complaint is that the 2015 pact, which was originally conceived as a starting point for better relations between Iran and the West, doesn’t extend beyond 2025. He also criticized the deal for failing to address other concerns about Iran, such as its ballistic missile program or its support of the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, its military aid of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and its role in the war in Yemen. Trump’s stance echoes Israel’s longstanding opposition to the deal. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week alleged that “Iran lied” about its nuclear weapon ambitions in the 2000s , although the information he shared seemed to match up with what nuclear inspectors had already reported about Tehran’s program. Although Trump has been emphatic in his opposition to the deal, he was less clear about what should replace it or how far the U.S. is willing to go to limit Iran’s nuclear ambitions or its regional aggression. “With this decision, we at least get some clarity on the White House position,” said Sanam Vakil, a professor in the Middle East studies department at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Bologna, Italy. It also moves the Iran-U.S. tensions into a new phase after months of threats and insults. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, who is considered a moderate, last month dismissed Trump as a "building constructor" with no understanding of law or international treaties. Under the deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) , the United States committed to ease a series of sanctions on Iran and has done so under a string of “waivers” that effectively suspend them. Failure to renew waivers means the sanctions will be restored, but under U.S. law the White House must allow a 90-day or 180-day period to allow companies to withdraw from any contracts or financial transactions involving Iran. The waiver that was due for renewal Saturday covered Iran's central bank and was intended at limiting Iran's oil exports. Other waivers are due for renewal in July. In his televised address on Tuesday, Trump said the United States would impose the "highest-level" economic sanctions on the Iranian regime, suggesting that he intends to scrap all of the waivers. Restoring sanctions amounts to a U.S. breach of the original deal whereas Iran was deemed to be compliant, according to international nuclear inspectors. The JCPOA has a dispute resolution clause that would allow Iran to raise a complaint against the U.S. for violating its terms; that could buy time for more negotiation, but Trump’s solid opposition to the deal means the dispute mechanism is unlikely to prove fruitful. While denouncing Trump’s plan, Tehran has not been entirely clear about what it will do once the impromptu public protests subside and American flags stop being burned. It could resume its nuclear arms program or step up its military involvement in Iraq, Syria, Yemen and Lebanon. The secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, Ali Shamkhani, warned last month that Iran was considering withdrawing from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Iran says it has the technical ability to enrich uranium to a higher level than it could before the deal. Rouhani has also ruled out any attempt to restrict its missiles , saying, "We will not negotiate with anyone about our weapons and defenses, and we will make and store as many weapons, facilities and missiles as we need.” If the deal is considered dead, Iran would no longer be obliged to allow international nuclear inspectors “so that we lose what visibility we have there,” Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, predicted on "Fox News Sunday ." However, Iran appears to be in line with European powers who want the deal to continue regardless of U.S. involvement. Rouhani said after Trump's announcement that he was sending his foreign minister to meet the remaining powers in the deal but warned there was only a short time to negotiate with them. The European Union's foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, said the deal is “a good and robust agreement that serves the interests of all parties.” And French Defense Minister Florence Parly said Tuesday that "we will need to keep pushing to defend the improvement of this deal, whether the United States is part of it or not." However, a major hurdle for the remaining powers in the deal will be operating under a different sanctions policy than the U.S.; experts predict that most major international companies will comply with U.S. sanctions in order to protect their interests in the U.S. market. Major companies in the U.S. and Europe could be hurt, too. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that licenses held by Boeing and its European competitor Airbus to sell billions of dollars in commercial jetliners to Iran will be revoked. Certain exemptions are to be negotiated, but Mnuchin refused to discuss what products might qualify. At a briefing for reporters late Tuesday, a State Department official confirmed that the White House was considering sanctions on non-U.S.companies that did not comply. And while Iran’s leaders may have been more willing to take a softer stance in talks with non-U.S. parties, anger at Trump’s decision may make that politically impossible. “Should there be some momentum, Iran has indicated that perhaps it might negotiate on some of the wider issues,” Vakil said. “But right now it is obviously in a defensive mood, and domestic, sectional politics very much drives its ability to come back to the negotiating table.” The perceived benefit of restoring sanctions is that an economically weakened and isolated Iran would have to scale back its regional aggression. “It also puts pressure on Iran and the international community to address Trump’s personal concerns with the deal,” Vakil said. However, a simulation exercise carried out last fall by Israeli and American experts concluded that there was little else to be gained by scuttling the deal. In particular, it seems unlikely Iran would agree to a tougher deal while the international position is so divided; splintering the deal plays into Tehran’s hands, the experts concluded. The collapse of the deal comes amid signs that Israel and Iran are moving closer to open warfare . Netanyahu on Tuesday accused Iran of deploying "very dangerous weapons" in neighboring Syria. "It is now seeking to plant very dangerous weapons in Syria ... for the specific purpose of our destruction,” he told reporters. Israel has repeatedly warned it will not tolerate a lasting Iranian military presence in Syria , and is believed to have been behind recent airstrikes on Syrian military bases that killed Iranian soldiers, prompting Tehran to vow revenge. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied involvement. Before Trump announced his decision, French President Emmanuel Macron had warned that war could ensue if Trump withdrew from the deal. Without limits on Iran’s nuclear ambitions or inspections of Iranian facilities, Israel could feel compelled to act against its archenemy. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said last week that scrapping the Iran deal put the entire Middle East in a “very dangerous position." After Trump's announcement on Tuesday, Macron tweeted that France, Germany, and the U.K. regretted the United States' decision but would work "collectively on a broader framework, covering nuclear activity, the post-2025 period, ballistic activity and stability in the Middle-East, notably Syria, Yemen and Iraq." Perhaps the most troubling outcome of Trump’s move for diplomats is the longer-term erosion of trust in the United States. Iranian Vice President Eshaq Jahangiri said Tuesday that only “naïve” individuals would negotiate with the U.S. in the future. His comments echoed a warning from Rouhani that “no one will trust America again" after this episode. It is something that might be noted by North Korea’s Kim Jong Un as he prepares to sit down for talks with the U.S. following last month’s summit that eased tensions with South Korea. The deal also has opponents in Iran, where many say they haven’t seen the economic benefits that Rouhani promised would flow following the lifting of sanctions. Spiraling inflation in Iran has fueled nationwide protests in December and January. The collapse of the deal would also vindicate the position of Rouhani’s hard-line opponents who criticized the very existence of any deal with the U.S. That could drive Iran back into the hands of hard-liners in elections for its Parliament in 2020 and its presidency in 2021. “The fallout from Trump’s announcement will leave Rouhani completely marginalized,” Vakil said. “Conservatives will have the dominant narrative, and Rouhani’s legacy of engagement with the international community will be completely discredited.” © 2019 NBC UNIVERSAL","https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/trump-scraps-iran-nuclear-deal-now-what-n872296"
"As Trump mulls the Iran deal’s fate, a three-ring circus ensues","With fewer than two weeks to go before the deadline for an American decision on continuing the Iran nuclear agreement, the debate over the fate the deal has become a three-ring circus, with Israelis, Europeans, and the Iranians themselves all jockeying to shape the outcome in their own favor. At this point, only two things are clear: President Donald Trump is reveling in his role of ringmaster, entertaining appeals from U.S. allies and holding the world in suspense while he ostensibly deliberates over a choice with massive national security and economic implications. As he has routinely reminded visiting dignitaries and the listening press corps, this momentous decision will be his and his alone. And the chaotic state of play suggests that the upcoming deadline for sustaining U.S. compliance with the agreement may serve as a beginning, rather than an end—the opening of a new phase of uncertainty and possibly even diplomacy. Trump will issue his verdict on the Iran deal next week, but the decision will likely usher in an even more intense ambiguity surrounding the status of the nuclear agreement, the state of the trans-Atlantic relationship, the legality of doing business with Iran, and the prospects for military conflict involving Tehran and its proxies across the Middle East. The latest act under the big top played out in Tel Aviv, where Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu shared what was hyped as “dramatic news” about Iran’s nuclear program. In a memorable live televised address from Israeli military headquarters, Netanyahu unveiled a treasure trove of apparently original documentation of Iran’s nuclear program and proclaimed that Tehran had lied “big time” about its nuclear activities. Netanyahu gave a characteristically theatrical performance, pulling back curtains to reveal stacks of files from what he described as half a ton of archival material on Iran’s nuclear program that Israeli operatives extracted from a Tehran warehouse in what appears to have been a fascinating intelligence coup. The archives’ actual revelations…were less dazzling. The archives’ actual revelations, however, were less dazzling. Despite the prime minister’s breathless pronouncement, the cache of Iranian documents has thus far divulged little more than what we already widely knew—that Iran’s nuclear program was never intended for the generation of civilian energy for peaceful purposes, as Tehran claimed, but rather for the pursuit of a nuclear weapons capability. That should come as no surprise to all but the most naïve consumers of Iran’s persistent denials. In fact, the wide recognition of the threat posed by Iran’s nuclear program precipitated unprecedented international sanctions and ultimately the nuclear accord. However, Netanyahu was not aiming to shape the views of those already acquainted with the long history of the Iran nuclear crisis or its seeming resolution with the 2015 nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Rather, his statement was orchestrated to reinforce Trump’s frequently expressed misgivings about the agreement and about Iran. Standing before a screen emblazoned with the phrase “Iran lied” in three-foot-tall type, the Israeli prime minister deftly juxtaposed public statements by Iranian officials insisting on the nuclear program’s peaceful intent with the official acknowledgements throughout the Iranian archives that this was always a ruse. For Trump, this presentation served as confirmation of his deeply held conviction that Iran cannot be trusted and that Tehran diabolically hoodwinked the Obama administration and its diplomatic partners into a fundamentally unfair deal. Echoing the president’s description last week of the JCPOA as “a terrible deal,” Netanyahu transparently egged on Trump’s opposition to it, adding that “I’m sure he’ll do the right thing” in his decision next week about the future of the agreement. Netanyahu’s message clearly resonated with Trump, and it may well have tipped the scales for a president already inclined to walk away from the agreement at the upcoming deadline. But it did little to actually undermine the case for the deal itself; in fact, his detailed description of Iran’s past record of hiding its nuclear activities only underscores the value of the robust monitoring and verification regime that the JCPOA erected and that will be put in jeopardy if the United States takes steps to unravel the agreement. The deal was never predicated on trust in Iran—just the opposite: American negotiators, with their European, Russian, and Chinese partners devised an unprecedented array of oversight mechanisms within the framework of the JCPOA to serve as an ironclad defense against a renewed Iranian nuclear weapons program. Should Trump repudiate the nuclear deal, there is no reason to believe that Tehran will continue to submit to international monitoring or to sustain the constraints on its nuclear program as required under the accord. The deal was never predicated on trust in Iran—just the opposite. Netanyahu’s gambit followed on the heels of a pair of high-level European visits to Washington that aimed at persuading Trump to stop short of unraveling the nuclear deal. French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel sought to build on months of working-level negotiations on measures to strengthen the provisions of the nuclear deal, as Trump had demanded in January. The talks had made some headway at defining ways to address Iran’s missile capabilities, strengthen the deal’s inspections regime, and extend the lifespan of its restrictions on Iran’s nuclear activities. Still, the months of diplomatic legwork had only exposed the seemingly insurmountable divergence between Trump’s determination to revise the nuclear deal’s central premise—Iran’s acceptance of temporary constraints on its activities in exchange for economic benefits—and the Europeans’ equal resolve to preserve and uphold the existing arrangement. Neither Macron nor Merkel succeeded in making a breakthrough in the stalemate over the terms of a supplemental agreement. Still, the French president sought to salvage some opening for multilateral diplomacy on Iran. In doing so, like Netanyahu, Macron openly played to Trump’s ego in importuning the president during a joint press conference at the White House, saying: “We should not tear apart JCPOA and have nothing else—that would not be a good solution.” Instead, Macron proposed a “new deal” in language that evoked Trump’s long experience in real estate—“building something new that will cover all concerns.” That possibility also seemed to strike a chord with the president, who mused : “I think we will have a shot to be a much bigger deal. … We’ll know fairly soon.”   Related Content             Order from Chaos  Trump, promising hellfire in Syria, blinked. Why that could bode well for the Iran deal   Suzanne Maloney  Wednesday, April 18, 2018              Order from Chaos  Trump’s new national security team likely spells disaster for the Iran nuclear deal   Suzanne Maloney  Monday, April 2, 2018       Trump’s cryptic public statements and the dueling supplication of Israeli and European leaders (as well as a spate of public comments by his own advisers ) underscore that the outcome of the upcoming decision on the deal remains fluid. Trump must balance his loathing of the nuclear agreement with his instinctive aversion to military entanglements in the Middle East and the tantalizing prospect that he might steer some more ambitious course for “a much bigger deal” on Iran. This would be the longest of long shots. Any pivot from an American abrogation of an existing accord to a much more elaborate diplomatic scheme for addressing the broad scope of international concerns about Iran’s foreign and domestic policies would require Olympian ingenuity—a quality that is in particularly short supply for the current administration. And crafting an expanded platform for negotiations would necessitate Iranian restraint in the face of pressure and perhaps even renewed engagement with Washington—in other words, an almost inconceivable embrace of practicality over ideology by the Iranian leadership, whose engrained paranoia has only been confirmed and intensified by the American about-face on the nuclear deal. Still, under almost any circumstances, Trump’s decision on the deal will lead the world into uncharted waters, with few alternatives that are more attractive than Hail Mary diplomacy and with a brief interlude that will be ripe for diplomatic damage control. With little evidence that the Trump administration has prepared for a smooth re-imposition of sanctions, even an unqualified repudiation of the deal on May 12 would entail some pause for necessary diplomatic and bureaucratic groundwork. The framework for dispute resolution within the JCPOA would also offer an opportunity of as much as 30 days for adjudicating any complaint about U.S. adherence to the agreement. However Trump plays the upcoming deadline, the due date for another set of sanctions waivers looms in mid-July, which would add urgency to any effort to avert escalation. In the abstract, trying to fix the weaknesses in the existing nuclear agreement by devising a new diplomatic framework that would seek to overcome decades of mutual grievances and Tehran’s deep investment in ideological and operational antagonism to U.S. interests and allies seems like a preposterous approach. But in the words of another Donald (Rumsfeld), you go to war with the army you have, not the one you wish to have. Instead of writing eulogies for the deal that was, defenders of the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement must begin strategizing around the diplomacy that could be. There are few other viable options that offer at least a chance of averting an unchecked Iranian nuclear program in the hands of a leadership determined to escalate its conflict with Washington.

"Europe Tests the Boundaries on Iran","NAYSAN RAFATI is the Iran analyst at the International Crisis Group. ALI VAEZ directs the Iran project at the International Crisis Group. On January 31, 2019, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom announced their most substantive move yet to save the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, to which they are signatories, from collapse. With the European Union’s blessing, the three states established a special channel that shields trade with Iran from U.S. sanctions. The Instrument in Support of Trade Exchanges, or INSTEX, as the channel is called, holds out the possibility that Europe can yet salvage the nuclear agreement’s core bargain: that Iran was to limit its nuclear activities in return for the normalization of economic relations. The preservation of this arrangement will depend not only on the modicum of European-Iranian trade that INSTEX might help preserve but on whether Europe can navigate a narrow path between what Iran expects and what the United States can tolerate. President Donald Trump’s decision in May 2018 to withdraw from the nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), brought with it the return of powerful U.S. sanctions that had been frozen as part of the agreement. The new sanctions, unlike those that had preceded the JCPOA, have neither UN nor EU support. Washington put them in place unilaterally—but still to devastating effect. In recent months, dozens of international companies have left Iran, the country’s oil exports have halved, its national currency has tumbled in value, and inflation has soared. Iran’s parliamentary think tank has issued a bleak forecast, suggesting that, in the more optimistic of two scenarios, the country could expect -2.6 percent growth this year and -4.5 percent next year. The country’s president has assessed the economic situation as the direst in the four decades since the 1979 revolution. As the White House tries to rally broader international support for its “maximum pressure” campaign, one stubborn fact bedevils its efforts: over the past two years, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the UN secretary-general, and, last week, the U.S. Director of National Intelligence, have consistently Loading, please wait...

"The Path of Broke Nuclear Agreements","Unlike North Korea today, Iran does not possess a single nuclear weapon. By trashing the Iran deal, President Trump risks turning Iran into North Korea. President Donald Trump, at the urging of National Security Advisor John Bolton, has withdrawn from the Iran nuclear agreement, putting the future of the deal in jeopardy. Trump did this despite the fact that Iran is in compliance with the deal, that the deal has served to shrink Iran’s nuclear program and keep it away from a bomb, and that it has prevented another costly war in the Middle East. Just how bad will things get with Iran now that Trump has acted? Hard to say, but we can see the writing on the wall: Tehran could restart its nuclear program and edge closer to building a bomb. This would lead to increased calls from the right to—once again—stop Iran from acquiring nuclear capability, by military force if necessary. Trump is already indicating that things are heading in that direction. Just one day after breaking out of the Iran deal, Trump warned of “very severe consequences” if Iran resumes its nuclear program. To fully understand the risks of the Trump administration abandoning the Iran deal, one need only recall what happened in North Korea after Bolton, then in the Bush administration as an under secretary of state, did his part to kill another landmark nuclear deal—the Agreed Framework. In 1994, the North Korean regime threatened to go nuclear for the first time. To prove the point, Pyongyang expelled all international inspectors and made preparations to extract weapons-grade plutonium from its Yongbyon research reactor. The risks of a conventional conflict—even then— were high because the Clinton Administration was seriously considering military intervention in case diplomacy failed. An unprecedented meeting between former president Jimmy Carter and North Korean leader Kim Il-sung eventually led to the first U.S.-North Korea nuclear deal, the Agreed Framework. Though only four pages long, the Agreed Framework served a similar purpose to the 159-page Iran agreement: to prevent a state from developing nuclear weapons. And, though neither agreement was perfect, the Agreed Framework—like the Iran deal thus far—proved successful, preventing the North from producing dozens more nuclear weapons worth of fissile material. For nearly a decade, the North readmitted international inspectors, stopped producing plutonium and shelved plans to build two large reactors. Despite these significant benefits, there were those who vehemently opposed the Agreed Framework and were bent on killing it. Sound familiar? Bolton, following reports that the North was secretly pursuing a uranium enrichment program, wrote later, “This was the hammer I had been looking for to shatter the Agreed Framework.” Opposition to the Agreed Framework was indeed substantive (North Korea began a uranium path; the United States did not fulfill key obligations), but much had to do with matters unrelated to North Korea. The George W. Bush administration came into power resistant to engaging with adversaries and determined to exercise status as the world’s sole superpower, which led to the war with Iraq. Then-Vice President Dick Cheney said it all when he declared, “We don’t negotiate with evil. We defeat it.” Instead of working to improve the Agreed Framework by adding additional, stronger measures to what already existed, the Bush administration chose to back out of the agreement in 2002. Since that time, North Korea has consistently shocked the world with the speed, sophistication, and fulfillment of its nuclear ambitions. In the last year alone, Kim Jong-un demonstrated the country’s most powerful nuclear and missile tests yet—a hydrogen bomb and an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of hitting the United States. In spite of famine, international isolation, and mounting sanctions, North Korea has become one of the most challenging U.S. foreign policy issues. Now, it is difficult to conceive of North Korea relinquishing a nuclear arsenal it has worked for two decades to achieve. But in 1994, long before North Korea tested its first bomb, the North did not have nuclear weapons to give up. Since then, the chance of convincing North Korea to give up its nuclear program has become less likely and more costly. That history begs the question: What would North Korea look like today had we kept the Agreed Framework and built on it, rather than throwing it away? Unlike North Korea today, Iran does not possess a single nuclear weapon, only the theoretical capability to one day produce them. By trashing the Iran deal, President Trump risks turning Iran into North Korea. John Bolton was a central player in withdrawing U.S. support from the North Korea deal in 2002 and from the Iran deal now. History has shown that abandoning the North Korea deal made the problem worse, not better.

"In exiting the Iran deal, Trump left U.N. sanctions relief intact—why that could pose problems down the road","The president’s decision to violate the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) with Iran by indicating U.S. intent to reimpose sanctions and withdraw from the agreement has been rightly condemned as a mistake. Some supporters of the Iran nuclear deal have taken comfort from the fact that, in taking the United States out of the JCPOA, Donald Trump did not simultaneously launch the snap-back of U.N. Security Council (UNSC) sanctions against Iran. They have suggested that this will protect the JCPOA for a bit longer and, simultaneously, avoid demonstrating how isolated the United States is at the U.N. Security Council. All of this may be true and, for the time being, keeping Security Council involvement at bay may be in the best interests of both the agreement and the United States. Yet, the failure to pursue snap-back at the UNSC ceded significant leverage that the United States could have used now and that the international community may wish to have in the future, compounding the damage of this hasty decision. Since July 2006 , the UNSC has adopted four resolutions imposing sanctions on Iran in response to concerns about its nuclear and missile programs. Five are particularly salient: When the Iran nuclear deal negotiations concluded, the UNSC decided to adopt a new resolution ( UNSCR 2231 ) that would replace the previous ones. It phased out the conventional arms- and missile-related prohibitions in five and eight years, respectively, and changed the nuclear prohibitions from a blanket set of denials to a somewhat more permissive regime. This would require Iran and those exporting nuclear goods to Iran to submit export applications to a procurement channel that would guard against illicit Iranian nuclear traffic and ensure that JCPOA members could scrutinize any of Iran’s nuclear-related procurement. This requirement would phase out in 10 years, when the UNSC’s mandate over Iran was scheduled to expire. The adoption of UNSCR 2231 and its contents were highly controversial, and critics charged that it badly compromised the international framework for confronting Iran. In particular, they expressed concern that the JCPOA and UNSCR 2231 would enable Iran to acquire conventional arms and missiles without restrictions after the expiration dates. They also took issue with the procurement channel, arguing that it had structural deficiencies and pointing out that the requirement to use it would one day lapse. Many of these critics championed the “fix or nix” approach (that the president ultimately resolved on May 8 in favor of “nix”), in part on the basis of these critiques. Perhaps more fundamentally, JCPOA critics said that the core error of the nuclear deal was that it eliminated a legal prohibition on Iran’s ability to enrich uranium and process plutonium—established in UNSCR 1737 in December 2006—in favor of the more permissive approach in the JCPOA. Taking aside whether these criticisms are accurate, fair, or valid, they were a major part of the argument against the JCPOA in 2015.

Ambassador Nikki Haley’s efforts to draw attention to Iran’s activities in Yemen, though thus far unpersuasive according to other U.N. missions with whom I have spoken, also demonstrate that some in the U.S. government still see the value of multilateral cooperation. Without question, snap-back was within Washington’s reach, since the JCPOA and UNSCR 2231 allowed any permanent UNSC member to reimpose UNSC sanctions on its own (as paragraphs 36 and 37 of the JCPOA make clear), after a process lasting 60 to 80 days. The United States insisted on these provisions in 2015 to address the complaint of JCPOA critics that, without such a snap-back, the United States would be at the mercy of Russia, China, and perhaps European partners too invested in commerce with Iran to hold Iran accountable for JCPOA violations. These were arguably the most deferential powers the UNSC could put in the hands of the United States—something an “America First”-obsessed president should like. That the United States would not use these powers, even at the expense of another 60 to 80 days in the JCPOA, is surprising. It suggests the president (and perhaps the national security advisor) were so desperate to withdraw the United States from the agreement as fast as possible—and before U.S. and European negotiators found solutions to the diplomatic impasse—that they would be prepared to compromise sanctions re-imposition goals to do so. For the time being, there is little difference between Iran’s compliance (or lack thereof) under UNSCR 2231 as compared to the previous resolutions. In fact, Iran’s nuclear procurement behavior is arguably much better under UNSCR 2231: There have been no confirmed reports of illicit Iranian nuclear procurement since the JCPOA entered into force. And, though it is not particularly comforting to say so, Iran’s noncompliance with its missile and conventional arms prohibitions under UNSCR 2231 is not manifestly different than how it ignored its corresponding obligations under the previous resolutions. For those who believed the UNSC endorsed Iran’s nuclear and missile programs by adopting UNSCR 2231, this decision not to snap back the previous resolutions also ought to be a major blow.  After all, the president had the chance to reestablish the legal prohibition on Iran’s possession of an enrichment program, among other things, to which they credit significant value. These critics’ relative silence on this point suggests that their objections to the UNSC’s dropping of Iran’s requirement to suspend its enrichment and heavy-water related activities from resolution 1737 were more theological than practical. But, in the medium to long term, the decision to forgo UNSC snap-back will be problematic. First of all, a careful read of UNSCR 2231 indicates that the United States can’t invoke the UNSC snap-back procedure now that it is no longer a JCPOA participant. If that is correct, it means that, even in the event of major Iranian nuclear noncompliance, the United States will either have to secure the required votes for reimposing UNSC sanctions under the normal Security Council process—gaining the support of the four other veto-holders—or rely on France or the United Kingdom to trigger snap-back on our behalf. This will constrain future U.S. options. Second, this means that unless other members of the JCPOA trigger snap-back on their own, the prohibitions on transfers of conventional arms- and missile-missiles in UNSCR 2231 will still expire in 2020 and 2023. The United States will retain its ability to go after these transfers unilaterally through its own national authorities (which was the original Obama administration plan), but will have to do so in the potentially compromised sanctions environment that the rash decision to end U.S. participation in the JCPOA may engender. Third, the same will apply to the expiration of the nuclear procurement-related provisions in 2025. But the United States will find it very difficult to intervene to prevent problematic procurements in the meantime: It’s no longer a member of the Joint Commission of the JCPOA, which reviews procurement activities. It will have to rely on the United Kingdom, France, and Germany—which is not necessarily a problem, since they retain a strong interest in denying Iran the ability to obtain items that could help Iran develop a nuclear weapons option or shorten breakout times. But it is hard to believe such a situation would have been considered a reasonable outcome in 2015 when the JCPOA was under such scrutiny. The United States will have the technical ability to block such transfers when reported to the UNSC (as required in Op 16 of UNSCR 2231) but its ability to act will be constrained. The terms of the resolution state that the Joint Commission’s recommendations in this regard will be “deemed to be approved unless the Security Council adopts a resolution to reject a Joint Commission recommendation within five working days of receiving it.” This means that the United States will have to convince at least seven other UNSC members, including the four other veto-holding members, to block such transfers. This seems unlikely in the event of a Joint Commission recommendation to proceed. Fourth, in the absence of snap-back, the United States will lose the authority of the UNSC to induce cooperation with the broader U.S. sanctions agenda and to reestablish the UNSC’s imprimatur over U.S. and partner sanctions in the event of a future contingency. Though the Trump administration may generally hold multilateral institutions in low regard, they played a valuable role in encouraging U.S. partners to follow its lead in imposing their own autonomous sanctions against Iran. UNSCR 1929’s language on oil and gas equipment supporting Iran’s nuclear program, for example, helped the EU, Japan, and South Korea adopt unilateral sanctions against Iran’s energy sector in 2010. Without the ability to invoke UNSC sanctions now, the United States can only push on other countries using its own national tools and threats. This will damage the legitimacy of any resulting sanctions in the eyes of many international actors. It will also remove the veneer of compliance with the U.N. Charter that many countries used to explain at home why they decided to work with the United States on sanctions in the first place. The decision to not snap back UNSC sanctions immediately will allow EU and other states to navigate their own courses with Iran, free of the UNSC obligations that would have been re-imposed under a snap-back scenario. Though this paper has highlighted UNSC sanctions pertaining to the nuclear and missile programs, as well as conventional arms, other UNSC sanctions required increased financial vigilance and denial of services for business with Iran that—in previous EU legislative opinions—required fairly aggressive sanctions steps in the EU. For example, in 2010, the EU adopted a system for reviewing transactions with Iran over various different financial thresholds that were intended to stymie even normal business with Iran, but which was based on language in UNSCR 1929 that required enhanced scrutiny. Under a UNSC snap-back scenario, it is conceivable EU lawyers would have argued that such measures would again be compulsory. For the moment, as a JCPOA advocate, this costs me little sleep, since it increases the chances that Iran is willing to remain in the JCPOA for the time being and, more importantly, the chances that Iran’s nuclear program will remain constrained and intrusively monitored. But, it will harm our efforts to pressure Iran if it decides to break out of the JCPOA in the future, and it does nothing to improve upon the alleged deficiencies in the JCPOA that led to calls for its termination since 2015.

"US Quest for Iran Regime Change: Will EU Sustain the Nuclear Deal?","Select Page By Dan Steinbock | May 17, 2018 | Europe , Middle East , News & Analysis , Politics , US | 1 |      Trump's withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal was the wrong decision at the wrong time. It is likely to compound global political, economic and security risks. Now the EU, along with Russia and China, must sustain the nuclear deal. F or three years, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action nuclear accord (JCPOA) has offered Iran relief from US, UN, and multilateral sanctions on energy, financial, shipping, automotive, and other sectors. However, a shift in US policy began in late 2016, when the Senate and the House of Representatives unanimously extended the Iran Sanctions Act for a decade. Not only most Republicans, but many Democrats who had supported the JCPOA in the Obama era reversed their positions surprisingly quickly. That emboldened Trump’s far more muscular—and illicit—policy against Iran. Regionally, Trump’s stance leans on Saudi Arabia for economic and geopolitical support, as evidenced by the $110 billion arms deal with Riyadh a year ago, and reinforced security ties with Israel, as reflected by US recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel—a fatal policy mistake denounced by the international community at the UN, and one that reversed almost seven decades of US foreign policy. The increasing convergence of the US, Saudi, and Israeli interests in the Middle East reflects an escalating quest for regional primacy. Last October, the Trump administration designated for sanctions additional missile and Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-related entities, while threatening to cease implementing the JCPOA. By weakening Iran’s “moderates,” the White House hoped to incite “hawks” into strategic moves that could be used as a pretext for regime change. Supported by Republican neoconservatives and Democrats’ liberal interventionists, the plan relies on discontented Iranian exiles and Shah loyalists in the West, while Saudi Arabia and Israel try to soften Iran in military and covert operations in the region’s ongoing proxy wars. Along with economic pressures, Trump seized covert operations by naming the controversial Michael D’Andrea, who was deeply involved with the US interrogation program after 9/11 attacks, the head of CIA’s Iran operations, while the ultraconservative hawk Mike Pompeo replaced Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State. Both D’Andrea and Pompeo favor regime change in Iran. Trump also made the neoconservative John Bolton his national security adviser and Gina Haspel the new head of CIA. While Bolton contributed to the “weapons of mass destruction” pretense that led to the war in Iraq, Haspel served as chief of a CIA black site torture prison and played a role in the destruction of some 100 interrogation videotapes. In 2003, Bolton relied on false data from US-based Iraqi exiles; now he is reliant on flawed information from Iraqi exiles. In November 2017, Bolton urged the US to have a contingency plan for a “Shah of Iran scenario.” Four months before, he had advocated Trump’s withdrawal from the deal, pledging a regime change before February 2019—the 50 th anniversary of the Iranian revolution. After Bolton replaced Trump’s national security adviser H.R. McMaster in early April, he is now positioned to execute the regime change plan. Bolton supports Mojahedin-e Khalq (MEK), an Iranian opposition group which he relies for information (and speaking fees). MEK advocates violent overthrow of Iran’s democratically-elected government. Until the early 2010s, the UK, EU and the US considered MEK a cultist terrorist organization, but State Secretary Hillary Clinton de-listed the group, reportedly to use MEK for US purposes. Concurrently, Clinton effectively unblocked millions of dollars from the MEK to further lobby US Congress. The U-turn followed after generous speaking fees by MEK lobbyists to prominent former government leaders supporting regime change in Iran, including former CIA directors R. James Woolsey and Porter Goss, Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge, FBI Director Louis Freeh, Republican Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, NYC mayor Rudy Giuliani, chair of the House Intelligence Committee Mike Rogers, as well as Democrats, such as former Pennsylvania and Vermont Governors Ed Rendell and Howard Dean, and national security adviser to President Obama General Jim Jones, to mention just a few. On the MEK side, the demands for regime change in Iran were orchestrated largely by its leader Maryam Rajavi, the “President-elect” of the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), who has been investigated for terrorism in and expelled from France (her husband is wanted by Iraq for crimes against humanity), and Alireaza Jafarzadeh, the NCRI’s public face, who has fed US and international agencies “information” about Iran’s alleged nuclear ambitions since the early 2000s. Some of the MEK funds were accrued during the Iraq-Iran War (1980-88) when the MEK was hosted by Saddam Hussein to fight against Iran, reportedly in exchange for millions of dollars. From the 1990s to early 2000s, MEK coordinated terror raids against Iranian diplomatic missions internationally. According to NBC, the MEK—financed, trained and armed by Israel’s secret service—has assassinated Iranian nuclear scientists since 2007. Even before de-listing, the US provided training and funding for the MEK on US soil and in covert operations in Iran, according to the highly-regarded journalist Seymour Hersh. When MEK uses substantial funds to attract prominent Americans, the monies originate from money-laundering front organizations in Europe, the US, and the Middle East, according to the FBI and State Department. The case of the MEK, argues constitutional lawyer Glen Greenwald, indicates that the “US government is not opposed to terrorism; it favors it.” Along with the former Shah’s supporters in the US and elsewhere, the regime change planners rely on these shady figures, and their quasi-legal organizations, just as they did with Ahmed Chalabi of the Iraqi National Congress (NC) in 2003. That’s when sanctions led to the War in Iraq—which is their role now in Iran as well. Last week, the US, once again acting unilaterally, moved toward cutting Iran off from the global economy as the Treasury Department imposed new sanctions on several Iranian companies, individuals and officials presumably for an illegal currency-exchange network in the UAE. Through his 2016 campaign, Trump described the Iran nuclear deal as a “disaster.” Aggressive rhetoric is a key element in his deal-making. It is followed by redefinition of the terms. These unilateral efforts rest first on economic pressure, then political intimidation and, when necessary, military force. Following the JCPOA, primary sanctions on energy, financial, shipping, automotive and other sectors were lifted after the International Atomic Energy Agency’s (IAEA) certification in January 2016 that Iran had complied with the agreement. Yet, secondary sanctions on firms remained in place, along with sanctions applying to US companies, including banks. The White House will seek to strengthen the secondary sanctions, while seeking to restore the primary sanctions. Last October, Trump demanded the JCPOA to limit Iranian ballistic missile development and regional activities. Accordingly, the administration has imposed sanctions on additional entities related to Iran’s missile program, Navy operations in the Persian Gulf, and other activities in the region. The spotlight is back on Iran sanctions enacted or under consideration in the Congress, such as the Countering America’s Adversaries through Sanctions Act of 2017 (CAATSA), plus pending legislation relating to Iran’s ballistic missiles, the assets of Iranian leaders, stricter oversight on Iran’s access to finance, the re-imposition of waived U.S. sanctions, and possible multilateral international sanctions. Since Russia and China will stay solidly behind the Iran nuclear deal, the real question is whether the key European powers—Germany, France, the UK, and the EU itself—will defend it. Prior to Trump’s decision, EU leaders stressed the importance of the full implementation of the JCPOA. French President Emmanuel Macron warned that “the nuclear non-proliferation regime is at stake.” Germany’s Foreign Minister Heiko Maas argued that the JCPOA “makes the world safer.” UK Foreign Minister Boris Johnson said that the “UK remains strongly committed to the JCPOA.” And the top EU diplomat Federica Mogherini pledged the EU will remain committed to the deal. Yet, recently Macron said that “we will work collectively on a broader framework, covering nuclear activity, the post-2025 period, ballistic activity, and stability in the Middle East, notably Syria, Yemen and Iraq.” Such statements suggest that some EU leaders may try to redefine the EU approach by leaving the JCPOA intact, but coupling the deal with new and broader conditions, which would undermine the deal. The Trump administration is likely to target European businesses that have done business in and with Iran since the Iran nuclear deal. It may extend sanctions over to companies that represent other JCPOA parties—that is, China, France, Russia, UK, Germany and the EU—thus raising risks for their U.S. access. As Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin recently put it, European-Iran business agreements will be voided as “the existing licenses will be revoked.” Along with Renault, PSA Peugeot Citroen, and Sanofi, French companies have huge stakes in the deal, thanks to the Airbus contract to provide Iran Air 100 airplanes for $21 billion and the oil giant Total’s $2 billion deal to develop the South Pars oil field. Some 120 German companies, including Volkswagen and Siemens, operate in Iran and another 10,000 do business with Iran. Royal Dutch Shell would be adversely affected. Economic pressure could harm significantly Iran’s oil industry in which the largest single buyers include China, South Korea, Turkey, Japan, Italy and India. The White House’s message is loud and clear: “Get out of Iran, if you want to stay in the US” It is an effort at regime change but without international legitimacy, especially since Iran has fully implemented the JCPOA conditions. What’s in line now is the very credibility of the EU powers. This article was originally published at DifferenceGroup.net .

"Mideast allies pressed Trump to ditch the Iran deal. Are they ready for what’s next?","ISTANBUL — His closest allies in the Middle East — in Israel, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates — had pushed President Trump to exit the nuclear accord with Iran, sharing his conviction that the deal had only encouraged Iran’s military adventurism in the region. But it is precisely those allies that could face the potential consequences of Trump’s announcement Tuesday that the United States was withdrawing from the agreement . The decision, analysts said, is almost certain to further destabilize a Middle East crippled by civil wars and proxy skirmishes that have sent weapons pouring in and millions of refugees streaming out. In criticizing the deal Tuesday, Trump said that it “didn’t bring calm, it didn’t bring peace, and it never will.” He did not say what, if anything, would replace the accord or give any hint of how the United States planned to better ensure the security of its allies — at a moment when they are locked in an escalating conflict with Iran playing out in Syria, Iraq, Yemen and elsewhere. “It’s very unclear if the Americans have any strategy for the day after,” said Emile Hokayem, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. “It’s the worst of all worlds. You are going to do away with an arms-control agreement. But there are no building blocks for a regional strategy to contain Iran, or to engage Iran, for that matter.” “There will be satisfaction in Arab capitals and in Israel” after Trump’s announcement, he added. “But their interests will not be served without a broader policy framework.” Yoel Guzansky, a senior fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv, said that while the nuclear deal was flawed, “the question I am asking myself tonight is whether Trump has an overall American strategy to deal with Iran.” He continued: “At the same time he says he is leaving the deal, he also says he is withdrawing American troops from Syria . So he is sending a signal that he is not interested in the Middle East, and this is contradictory. America cannot withdraw and leave the Israelis and the Saudis to clean up its mess.” Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have led the charge against Iran in the Arab world, complaining about what they say is its interference in the internal affairs of the Persian Gulf monarchies. Saudi Arabia and the UAE have also united in a military coalition against a rebel group in Yemen that they accuse of acting as an Iranian proxy force. Both countries had complained bitterly that President Barack Obama ignored Gulf security concerns by pursuing the nuclear deal with Iran. Obama agreed to provide U.S. military support to the Saudi-led campaign in Yemen in part to assuage the anger of his Gulf allies, according to officials in his administration. The longtime rivalry between Iran and Saudi Arabia worsened over the past year, as Saudi officials accused Iran of supplying the Yemeni rebels, known as the Houthis, with ballistic missiles that have been fired into Saudi territory. Iran has denied supplying the rebels with missiles. Israel has vigorously lobbied against the Iran deal from the outset, saying that no deal is better than a bad deal. “Fix it or nix it” has become Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s refrain. But his security chiefs have raised concerns that the collapse of the deal could backfire for Israel. In an interview with Israeli newspaper Haaretz in May, the country’s top military commander, Lt. Gen. Gadi Eisenkot, chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces, said that there was no evidence Iran had breached the deal and that Israel was investing “vast resources” in intelligence to make sure it would know if it were. “Right now, the agreement, with all its faults, is working and is putting off realization of the Iranian nuclear vision by 10 to 15 years,” he said. “If the Americans decide to withdraw from the agreement on May 12, we will have to rethink our strategic risk management.” In a sign of the potential for escalation, the Israeli military asked residents of the Golan Heights to open bomb shelters Tuesday night because of the risk of an Iranian attack and “unusual” movement of Iranian forces inside Syria. Syria’s state news agency later reported that Israeli missiles had been intercepted near Damascus. After Trump’s announcement, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said he would continue to negotiate with Europe, Russia and China about remaining in the nuclear deal. But the U.S. withdrawal and the prospect of intense sanctions raise the possibility of Iranian retaliation, threatening states that were U.S. allies as well as countries where American troops are present. Iran “can increase the costs for the U.S. and for regional countries by engaging in small, deniable activities, to remind people that Iran is not without deterrents,” Hokayem said. “We all know that the Iranians can do something nasty here. It’s not clear that the U.S. and others have internalized this in their policy.” Michael Wahid Hanna, an analyst with the Century Foundation, said it was possible that Iran would show restraint to preserve the deal with Europe or to isolate the United States from its allies. “There are factions in Iran that would like to take the high ground, for public relations or rhetorical purposes,” he said. But at the same time, “I am sure Bashar al-Assad, Haider al-Abadi and Ashraf Ghani are nervous about what comes next,” he said, referring to the leaders of Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan — countries where there are U.S. troops. While those nations “ostensibly have productive relations with the Iranians, their interests aren’t perfectly aligned.” One potential consequence of the United States backing out of the nuclear deal is that the Iranian “means of retaliation” would occur in Syrian, Iraqi or Afghan territory, he said. Despite the regional focus on the consequences of the deal, the accord “was not what has allowed Iran to play a significant role in regional affairs,” Hanna said. He added that a number of irritants predated the deal, including sectarian tensions between the Sunni Gulf states and Iran, the overthrow of Saddam Hussein in Iraq, and a lack of diplomatic engagement with Iran during the first term of the George W. Bush administration. The proliferation of civil conflicts in the Middle East, many with sectarian overtones, had provided Iran with opportunities “to project influence and act as a spoiler,” he said. Despite that history, some of the countries in the region were hoping for a quick fix from the United States — “the deus ex machina that solves everyone’s problems,” Hanna said.

"Trump will pull out of Iran nuclear deal, leading senator predicts","Sun 18 Mar 2018 12.01 EDT   Last modified on Thu 5 Jul 2018 16.46 EDT   The chair of the Senate foreign relations committee has predicted Donald Trump will pull the US out of the nuclear deal with Iran . “The Iran deal will be another issue that’s coming up in May, and right now it doesn’t feel like it’s going to be extended,” Bob Corker told CBS’s Face the Nation in an interview broadcast on Sunday. “I think the president likely will move away from it, unless our European counterparts really come together on a framework. And it doesn’t feel to me that they are. Now, as we get within two weeks of the 12 May date, that could change.” Corker also said he did not think such a move would damage attempts to set up a meeting the same month between Trump and Kim Jong-un, the dictator of nuclear-armed North Korea. The Tennessee senator has clashed repeatedly with Trump and will retire in November. He has been touted in some quarters as a presidential rival in 2020 . In his CBS interview, he said: “This whole situation with North Korea … is somewhat unorthodox, and I think you’re dealing with a leader there that probably doesn’t think the same way that other countries and their leadership might. So I’m not sure that [ending the Iran deal] is gonna end up having a detrimental effect.” Trump has long opposed the 2015 deal, which curtails Tehran’s development of nuclear weapons in return for sanctions relief, partly because his predecessor in the White House, Barack Obama, regarded it as a signature achievement. This week Trump fired the secretary of state, Rex Tillerson , a defender of the deal, and nominated the CIA director, Mike Pompeo, to replace him. “I wanted to either break it or do something and he felt a little bit differently,” Trump told reporters. “So we were not really thinking the same. With Mike, Mike Pompeo, we have a very similar thought process.” Trump is also reported to be close to replacing the national security adviser, HR McMaster, another defender of the deal, with the former Bush UN ambassador John Bolton, a hawk who favours pre-emptive military action. Corker said he thought Pompeo had a good chance of being confirmed by his committee, even though Rand Paul of Kentucky has said he will vote no . Paul spoke to CNN’s State of the Union. “I don’t think you really want people who are eager for war to be running the state department,” he said. “You want a diplomat.” Pompeo, he said, was “too much of an advocate for regime change, really everywhere” and was not a “good fit to be a diplomat”. Paul is also opposed to the appointment of Gina Haspel as Pompeo’s successor at the CIA. He told CBS there was “no evidence [Haspel] was protesting against torture” when she oversaw “enhanced interrogation” under the Bush administration. “There’s every evidence she was covering it up ,” he said. Tillerson, Corker said, was “doing fine” despite reportedly having been fired in an undignified manner: the White House chief of staff, John Kelly, claimed Tillerson took a warning call from him while on the toilet, and Tillerson then learned of the final decision by tweet. Corker added that he thought Trump “likes to hear diverse opinions”. “But once a decision is made,” he said, “I think [Trump] likes to see it move along quickly. And I think that was one of the frustrations he may have had with Secretary Tillerson.”","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/18/trump-iran-nuclear-deal-bob-corker"

The prime minister, who has long railed against the 2015 nuclear deal, gave a dramatic presentation a little over a week before Trump’s May 8 decision, where he unveiled documents Israel secreted away from Tehran that he said proved “Iran lied” about its nuclear program. “I said it from the start, it has to be either fully fixed or fully nixed,” Netanyahu said at the time. “But if you do nothing to this deal, if you keep it as is, you will end up with Iran with a nuclear arsenal in a very short time.” Netanyahu was a vocal opponent of the deal as it was being negotiated and when it was reached during the Obama administration. The agreement lifted painful economic sanctions against Iran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program. Netanyahu has repeatedly argued that the deal will not prevent Iran from gaining nuclear weapons capability after its restrictions expire in the next decade or so. Trump noted the Mossad haul of Iranian documents in his speech announcing the US pullout from the deal, saying they “conclusively” showed Iran’s efforts to obtain nuclear weapons. He however gave no indication his decision was swayed by Israel. In his announcement, the US president said the accord would not prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear arms and he therefore was exiting the agreement and reimposing sanctions. Trump’s decision was sharply opposed by Iran and the deal’s other signatories — Britain, France, Germany, Russia, and China. Those countries are currently working to preserve the accord following the US pullout. Israel considers Iran its arch-enemy, citing Iran’s calls for Israel’s destruction, support for terrorist groups across the region, and growing military activity in neighboring Syria. Israel has warned that it will not allow Iran, whose troops are backing Syrian President Bashar Assad, to establish a permanent military presence in Syria.","https://www.timesofisrael.com/in-recording-netanyahu-boasts-israel-convinced-trump-to-quit-iran-nuclear-deal/"
"The Economist explains","by M.S. When and how did these talks begin? Talks that led to a breakthrough interim agreement agreed in November of 2013, known both as the Geneva Accord and the Joint Plan of Action, began in February of that year . Prior to that there had been numerous (unsuccessful) attempts to negotiate a deal with Iran since 2002 when Iranian dissident groups raised the alarm over the country’s nuclear programme by revealing the existence of two facilities that had not been declared to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN’s nuclear watchdog. Two things have given the current talks real momentum, however. The first was a back channel to Iran opened up by the Obama administration in March 2013 that led to several secret bilateral meetings in Oman. The second was the election in June of 2013 of Hassan Rohani, who 10 years before had served as Iran’s nuclear negotiator, on a platform promising constructive engagement with the international community aimed at lifting harsh economic sanctions and ending Iran's international isolation. The negotiations leading to Thursday’s pact kicked off in March 2014. Several deadlines for a comprehensive agreement were extended. The final deadline has now been set for July 1st of this year, but the White House needed a detailed framework agreement to be in place well before the return of Congress from its Easter break, in order to head off an attempt by Republican critics of any deal with Iran to legislate for new sanctions and thus kill off the talks. Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks. Who are the P5+1? Why not call it the P6? The P5+1 are America, France, Britain, China, Russia and Germany. The first five are all permanent members of the UN Security Council. Germany is there because it was part of an EU3 including France and Britain, that held an earlier series of negotiations with Iran. The European Union is also represented at the talks by its foreign affairs supremo. The UN Security Council has passed a series of resolutions imposing sanctions on Iran since 2006 following reports by the IAEA regarding Iran's non-compliance with its safeguards agreement under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Sanctions were first imposed when Iran rejected the Security Council’s demand that Iran suspend all uranium enrichment-related and reprocessing activities. What did they hope to get out of a deal? In short, the P5+1 wants to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, or at least to stop it from being able to get one either very quickly or clandestinely. To that end the negotiators have compromised over allowing Iran to continue to enrich uranium, concluding that complete dismantling of a huge infrastructure was unrealistic. However, they have sought strict limits on Iran’s enrichment programme, the redesign of a plutonium-producing heavy water reactor under construction and a highly-intrusive inspection regime to prevent cheating. Their aim has been to extend Iran’s “breakout capability”—the key yardstick of the time needed to produce enough fissile material for one nuclear weapon — from the current estimate of a couple of months to at least a year, and to maintain it there for a decade or more. What did Iran hope to receive? For Iran, the pressing need is to gain relief from sanctions that have ratcheted up in severity and are having a crippling effect on its resource-dependent economy. In particular, restrictions on its oil and gas exports, its ability to import technology to exploit its energy resources, and being cut off from SWIFT, the financial-messaging system used to transfer money between the world’s banks, have taken an increasing toll. Iran would have liked all sanctions to end from the moment of a deal being signed, but relief will be staged on the basis of good faith implementation of whatever limits on the nuclear programme are finally agreed. Sanctions related to other aspects of Iran’s behaviour, such as human-rights issues, support of terrorism and its ballistic-missile programme will not be affected. Furthermore, Mr Obama can only suspend sanctions that Congress has legislated. What does the deal actually include? The agreement announced on Thursday night was more detailed than most expected , but nothing is in place until a formal deal is signed before the July 1st deadline. However, under this statement of intent Iran will reduce its installed enrichment centrifuges from 19,000 to 6,000, only 5,000 of which will be spinning. All of them will be first-generation centrifuges: none of its more advanced models can be used for at least 10 years, and R&D into more efficient designs will have to be based on a plan submitted to the IAEA. Fordow, Iran’s second enrichment facility (its main one is at Natanz) which is buried deep within a mountain and thought to be impregnable to conventional air strikes, will cease all enrichment and be turned into a physics research centre. It will not produce or house any fissile material for at least 15 years. Iran has said it will reduce its stockpile of low-enriched uranium (which can be spun further into weapons-grade material) from 10,000kg to 300kg for the next 15 years. Iran’s alternative plutonium path to a bomb also appears to have been satisfactorily dealt with. The heavy-water reactor at Arak will be redesigned and its original core, which would have produced significant quantities of weapons-grade plutonium, will be removed and destroyed. No other heavy-water reactor will be built for 15 years. All these undertakings hinge on the assurance that Iran will abide by them. Without a uniquely intrusive inspection and verification regime, sceptics would still be right to question their worth given Iran’s past history of lying and cheating over its nuclear programme. Under the terms of the framework agreement, inspectors from the IAEA will be able to inspect any facility, declared or otherwise, as long as it is deemed to be “suspicious”. The agreement also states that Iran will address the IAEA’s concerns about what it calls the Possible Military Dimensions (PMDs) of its nuclear programme. Such powers for the IAEA, which will remain in place indefinitely, are a lot more sweeping than those it has under the normal safeguard agreements that are part of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. What needs to happen by July 1st? Basically, a lot more of the technical detail needs to be filled in. The exact nature of the inspection and verification regime is especially important as are the penalties for non-compliance (such as automatic snapback of US and EU sanctions and new UN resolutions). Because the framework agreement was so specific, some of the heavy lifting has been done. But the negotiator’s watchword is that until everything is agreed, nothing is agreed. Who is hoping the deal falls apart? What are the odds they get their wish? The deal has many strenuous critics. The Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, has described it in almost apocalyptic terms (although much of Israel’s security establishment is more sanguine about it); Republican hawks in Congress (and even some Democrats) hate the idea of any deal with Iran that does nothing to address its behaviour as a troublemaker in the Middle East and as a sponsor of designated terrorist outfits, such as Hizbullah in Lebanon. The deal is also opposed by hardliners in Tehran who may still be hoping to win over the enigmatic but ailing supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, to their point of view. Elements of the powerful Iranian Revolutionary Guard (IRG), who control military sites which the IAEA will have to gain access to if it is to address the vital PMD issues, may be quite happy to find a way of sabotaging the deal. The IRG may even wish to see sanctions remain in place, as they have provided money-making opportunities for many of its leaders. However, the problem faced by those who would like to see the deal collapse is that they have yet to offer any attractive alternatives. Ordinary Iranians are desperate to get back to having a normal economy, while American voters have little appetite for going to war with Iran to prevent it getting a nuclear weapon. According to a Washington Post- ABC News poll conducted just before the agreement on April 2nd was announced, Americans support the notion of striking a deal with Iran that restricts the nation’s nuclear program in exchange for loosening sanctions, by a nearly two to one margin . If the deal holds together, what does that mean for the Middle East? That is hard to say. Overall, if the deal does what it is meant to, it should make the region a bit safer, heading off, at least for now, the prospect of a dangerous nuclear arms race involving Saudi Arabia and perhaps Egypt and Turkey as well. Israel will surely be more secure if Iran’s breakout capability is extended to over a year from just a month or so and its whole nuclear programme becomes vastly more transparent. What a deal is most unlikely to do, at least in the short-term, is to make Iran a more cooperative, less aggrandising player in the region’s geopolitics . If Iran feels richer, there is a risk it may actually interfere more. This is an arms-control deal between adversaries, not a friendship hug. Interests will continue to diverge between Iran and the West. Just possibly, however, if Iran’s economy becomes re-integrated with the world, and a degree of trust is established on all sides by Iran's meeting the obligations they have signed up to, something more fruitful could eventually emerge.

"The Wall Street Journal","May 21, 2019 The announced framework for an agreement on Iran’s nuclear program has the potential to generate a seminal national debate. Advocates exult over the nuclear constraints it would impose on Iran. Critics question the verifiability of these constraints and their longer-term impact on regional and world stability. The historic significance of the agreement and indeed its sustainability depend on whether these emotions, valid by themselves, can be reconciled.

"What's the Alternative to Obama's Iran Deal?","More sanctions are unlikely to produce a better nuclear agreement.  Benjamin Netanyahu insists that opposing Thursday’s framework nuclear deal with Iran doesn’t mean he wants war. “There’s a third alternative,” the Israeli prime minister told CNN on Sunday, “and that is standing firm, ratcheting up the pressure until you get a better deal.” There are three problems with this argument. The first is that even some of Netanyahu’s own ideological allies don’t buy it. Netanyahu and many Republican politicians—knowing that the American public doesn’t want war—insist that there’s a diplomatic alternative to the current deal. But over the years, key conservative foreign-policy experts, have said exactly the opposite. Eliot Cohen, a former Bush administration official who teaches at John Hopkins’ School of Advanced International Studies, has written that, “The choices are now what they ever were: an American or an Israeli strike, which would probably cause a substantial war, or living in a world with Iranian nuclear weapons, which may also result in war, perhaps nuclear, over a longer period of time. Understandably, the U.S. government has hoped for a middle course of sanctions, negotiations and bargaining that would remove the problem without the ugly consequences. This is self-delusion.” According to Max Boot of the Council on Foreign Relations, “The only credible option for significantly delaying the Iranian nuclear program would be a bombing campaign.” The Weekly Standard ’s Bill Kristol has argued that, “It’s long since been time for the United States to speak to this regime in the language it understands—force. … We can strike at the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), and weaken them. And we can hit the regime’s nuclear weapons program, and set it back.” And over the last month alone, two other prominent hawks, John Bolton and Joshua Muravchik, have penned op-eds entitled, “ To Stop Iran’s Bomb, Bomb Iran ” and “ War With Iran Is Probably Our Best Option .” Netanyahu may sincerely believe that there’s a preferable diplomatic alternative to last week’s deal. But it’s telling that for years now, many on his ideological side have disagreed. The second problem with Netanyahu’s argument is that it’s based on bizarre assumptions about Iranian politics. According to Netanyahu, if the United States walks away from the current deal, Iran’s desperation to end global sanctions will lead it to scrap its nuclear program almost entirely. But Iran’s nuclear program is decades old and enjoys broad public support. Even Mir-Hossein Mousavi, the leader of the reformist Green Movement, declared in 2009 that if elected, “we will not abandon the great achievements of Iranian scientists. I too will not suspend uranium enrichment.” It’s true that one wing of the current Iranian regime, led by President Hassan Rouhani and Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, will accept substantial limits on Iran’s nuclear program in return for the lifting of sanctions. But Rouhani’s hardline opponents, who benefit politically and economically from the sanctions, fiercely oppose such a deal. Netanyahu thinks a more aggressive American posture, coupled with a demand for near-complete Iranian capitulation, will make Tehran accept terms that today not even Iranian doves accept. To grasp how absurd that it is, just reverse the lens. How would more aggressive Iranian behavior, coupled with a demand for near-complete American capitulation, affect the debate in Washington? Would it turn Tom Cotton into Noam Chomsky? Of course not. It would empower those Americans who most oppose a deal already. It’s the same in Iran. If the United States scuttles Thursday’s deal, Ali Vaez, senior Iran analyst at the International Crisis Group told me, Rouhani and Zarif will “be totally discredited, marginalized. That would be the end of Rouhani’s attempt at talks to resolve this peacefully.” Rand Corporation Iran expert Alireza Nader added that, “If everything collapses and Rouhani has nothing to show for his efforts, the balance may go toward conservatives and ultra-conservatives and they can make it hard for him to go back to table.” Finally, there’s a third, less well-appreciated flaw in Netanyahu’s argument. He assumes that after walking away from the current deal, the United States can “ratchet up the pressure on Iran.” In fact, the pressure will likely go down. Yes, Congress can pass additional sanctions. But more American sanctions alone won’t have much effect. After all, the United States began seriously sanctioning Iran in the mid-1990s. Yet for a decade and a half, those sanctions had no major impact on Iran’s nuclear program. That’s largely because foreign companies ignored American pleas to stop doing business with the Islamic Republic. As Tyler Cullis of the National Iranian American Council explains, the shift came in 2010 when the UN Security Council passed resolutions essentially blessing America’s financial sanctions on Iran. Armed with this UN imprimatur, the Obama administration convinced Europe to stop doing business with Iranian banks and to stop importing Iranian oil. And while China and India didn’t cease Iranian oil imports altogether, they significantly reduced them. Why did the world suddenly crack down on Iran? Partly, it’s because the United States threatened that companies doing business with Iran would lose access to the American market. But America had been leveling that threat since the mid-1990s, and until 2010, foreign governments had largely ignored the threat. In 1996, for instance, after Bill Clinton signed a law giving the United States the right to bar foreign companies that invested in Iran’s energy sector from doing business in the U.S., the European Union threatened to take the United States to the World Trade Organization, and Clinton backed down. Things changed in 2010 because the Obama administration—aided by the antics of then-Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad—convinced European and Asian governments that the only way to get a diplomatic deal with Tehran was to apply economic pressure first. This global pressure has now isolated Iran from the world economy in a way that American pressure alone never could. But if the United States walks away from a deal that European and Asian governments support, those governments will not indefinitely maintain a sanctions regime that lacks domestic political support and costs them money. Last year, a report by the European Council on Foreign Relations warned that “those [in the United States] blocking implementation of a final deal … could endanger the international consensus backing sanctions against Iran.” If Congress torpedoes a deal, the report predicted, Europe might react “by easing its unilateral oil embargo against Iran.” In addition, “China and Russia … may become more sympathetic towards Iran’s position and see an opportunity to further advance their own interests at the expense of the US.” China, in particular, has a history of strong economic ties to Iran, a massive thirst for oil, and little interest in doing America’s bidding in the Middle East. If the United States walks away from a deal that Beijing has endorsed , it’s only a matter of time until China imports large quantities of Iranian crude. Chinese impatience is already starting to show. Beijing imported 30 percent more oil from Iran in 2014 than it had in 2013. As the International Crisis Group’s Ali Vaez observes, “The high-water mark of international sanctions is already behind us.” Netanyahu thinks the United States can blow up the current nuclear negotiations and then “ratchet up the pressure” on Tehran. But if China and other nations respond by busting the international sanctions that have isolated Iran over the past few years, the pressure on Iran won’t go up. It will go down. This doesn’t mean, as President Obama has suggested, that the only alternative to the current deal is war. But it does mean that all the other alternatives are bad. If nuclear negotiations fail, Iran might still stop short of building a bomb. That way it could enjoy the deterrence that comes from “threshold” nuclear status without weaponizing, which might provoke its neighbors to build nukes themselves. It’s even possible that if the U.S. sabotages Thursday’s deal, a future U.S. president might strike another nuclear agreement with Tehran. But by that point, sanctions would likely have eroded and Iran’s nuclear program would be further along. Which means that such a deal, far from being tougher, would be a lot weaker than the current one. The key flaw in Netanyahu’s critique of the Iran deal is his belief that America—having convinced the world to pressure Iran into accepting an agreement that enjoys global support—can now destroy that deal and expect the pressure to increase. It won’t. To the contrary, if America follows Netanyahu’s advice, Iran’s isolation will ease and America’s will grow. Perhaps it’s no surprise that a leader whose policies have so isolated his own country from the world is urging the United States down a similar path.

"President Obama Calls Preliminary Iran Nuclear Deal ‘Our Best Bet’","Advertisement Supported by By  Peter Baker WASHINGTON — President Obama strongly defended last week’s preliminary agreement with Iran as a “once in a lifetime opportunity” to curb the spread of nuclear weapons in a dangerous region while reassuring critics that he would keep all options available if Tehran ultimately cheated. As he sought in an interview with The New York Times to sell the tentative deal to skeptics accusing him of giving away too much, Mr. Obama emphasized to Israel that “we’ve got their backs” in the face of Iranian hostility. And he suggested that he could accept some sort of vote in Congress if it did not block his ability to carry out the agreement. “This is our best bet by far to make sure Iran doesn’t get a nuclear weapon,” Mr. Obama said in an interview with Thomas L. Friedman , an Op-Ed columnist for The Times, published on Sunday. “What we will be doing even as we enter into this deal is sending a very clear message to the Iranians and to the entire region that if anybody messes with Israel, America will be there.” In the interview, held Saturday, Mr. Obama provided new details about how international inspectors would try to access suspected covert nuclear sites and about the sequence that would lead to sanctions being lifted. Both were major issues in the last days of negotiations in Switzerland, and Mr. Obama’s descriptions differed in key respects from Iran’s interpretations. That gap suggested the hardest moments in the negotiations may yet be ahead, given that commitments made last week must still be enshrined in a written document signed by all parties by June 30. But Mr. Obama seemed to gain breathing space as Republicans signaled they would give him until then to see what the final deal looks like before directly intervening. The president’s comments came as the White House embarked on a campaign to sell a preliminary agreement that he hopes will transform security in the Middle East. Under the framework, negotiated with the United States and five other world powers, Iran agreed to scale back its nuclear program significantly for 10 to 15 years and accept intense international inspections. In exchange, the United States and the international community would lift sanctions that have punished the Iranian economy. While in theory preventing Iran from being able to quickly build a bomb, the agreement leaves it with a nuclear program in place, even if much diminished, drawing criticism from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and Republican leaders in Congress as well as skepticism from Arab allies and many Democrats. “Not a single centrifuge is destroyed,” Mr. Netanyahu said Sunday on “State of the Union” on CNN. “Not a single nuclear facility is shut down, including the underground facilities that they build illicitly. Thousands of centrifuges will keep spinning, enriching uranium. That’s a very bad deal.” Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a possible Republican presidential candidate, said it was “probably the best deal that Barack Obama could get with the Iranians because the Iranians don’t fear” him. “Hillary Clinton could do better,” he added, as could all the Republican candidates, “except maybe Rand Paul.” But Mr. Graham said he would wait to see how the final agreement looked. “I don’t mind giving the administration the time between now and June to put this deal together,” he said on “Face the Nation” on CBS. In the interview, the president struck a conciliatory note after weeks of open tension with Mr. Netanyahu, a clash that has worried even some White House advisers. Mr. Obama said “I respect” Mr. Netanyahu’s security argument and agreed that Israelis “have every right to be concerned about Iran,” a country that has threatened “to destroy Israel, that has denied the Holocaust, that has expressed venomous anti-Semitic ideas.” Whether Iran is racing toward nuclear weapon capabilities is one of the most contentious foreign-policy issues challenging the West. He pledged to redouble support for Israeli security. “I would consider it a failure on my part, a fundamental failure of my presidency, if on my watch, or as a consequence of work that I had done, Israel was rendered more vulnerable,” he said. Similarly, he said he wanted to use a meeting he has called at Camp David to “formalize” security aid for Arab allies threatened by Iran. While still resisting what he deemed congressional interference, Mr. Obama reached out to Republicans, calling Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, a “good and decent man.” He did not embrace Mr. Corker’s legislation to give Congress the right to approve or reject the deal. But when asked about a nonbinding vote, the president appeared supportive. “My hope is that we can find something that allows Congress to express itself but does not encroach on traditional presidential prerogatives and ensures that if in fact we get a good deal that we can go ahead and implement it,” Mr. Obama said. Mr. Corker, appearing on “Fox News Sunday,” immediately rejected the idea of a nonbinding vote. “There is strong bipartisan support for a binding vote by Congress,” he said. “Look, the president needs to sell this to the American people, and Congress needs to be involved in this way.” Under the agreement, Iran would limit enrichment of uranium at its Natanz facility to a level useful only for civilian purposes; cut back the number of installed centrifuges by approximately two-thirds; convert its Fordo deep-underground enrichment facility into a research center; and modify its Arak heavy-water reactor to render it incapable of producing plutonium for a bomb. But the structure of international inspections was left vague, as was the timing for lifting sanctions. Mr. Obama said that inspectors would be able to watch “the entire nuclear chain” and that a “procurement committee” would examine Iranian imports to be sure equipment would be appropriate for peaceful nuclear uses, not a weapon. Inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency, he said, “can go anyplace.” But the administration has been vague about how to define “anyplace,” and Iran has said it would not be required to allow inspections of military bases. “Iran could object,” Mr. Obama acknowledged, “but what we have done is to try to design a mechanism whereby once those objections are heard, that is not a final veto that Iran has but in fact some sort of international mechanism will be in place that makes a fair assessment.” Mr. Obama said sanctions would be lifted only after Iran lived up to its commitments. “There are still details to be worked out,” he said, “but I think that the basic framework calls for Iran to take the steps that it needs to around Fordo, the centrifuges and so forth. At that point, then the U.N. sanctions are suspended.” A guide to help you navigate the deal between global powers and Tehran. He said the United States would “preserve the ability to snap back those sanctions if there is a violation.” And he added that separate sanctions imposed for other reasons, namely Iran’s sponsorship of terrorists and its ballistic missile program, would remain in place. Administration officials said they envisioned Iran being able to take the required steps within months or a year of an agreement, at which point nuclear-related economic sanctions would be removed. But a major sticking point in the coming months will be the issue of additional sanctions imposed for other reasons. Mr. Obama said almost nothing about how the United States and its allies would force Iran to answer questions about suspected past work on weapons designs. For years, Iran has blocked inspectors from visiting laboratories where such work is believed to have been conducted. Mr. Obama presented the nuclear agreement in broader terms. He admitted that he remained uncertain about the intentions of the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, with whom he has exchanged letters. “He’s a pretty tough read,” Mr. Obama said. The ayatollah’s letters, he said, are filled with “a lot of reminders of what he perceives as past grievances against Iran.” But Mr. Obama said it was telling that the ayatollah allowed his negotiators to make concessions, and he held out hope that the agreement would empower more moderate figures, although he said he was not counting on it. “Who knows?” he added. “Iran may change.” But if not, he said, the United States retains “the most firepower” to address any contingencies. “It’s not as if in all these conversations, I’m leaving all my, you know, rifles at the door,” he said. Asked about an Obama Doctrine, he said: “The doctrine is we will engage, but we preserve all our capabilities. And I’ve been very clear that Iran will not get a nuclear weapon on my watch, and I think they should understand that we mean it. But I say that hoping that we can conclude this diplomatic arrangement and that it ushers in a new era in U.S.-Iranian relations.” David E. Sanger contributed reporting. Opinion Thomas L.

"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Releases Green New Deal Outline","Danielle Kurtzleben  The Green New Deal legislation laid out by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey sets goals for some drastic measures to cut carbon emissions across the economy. In the process, it aims to create jobs and boost the economy. Amr Alfiky/NPR  hide caption  The Green New Deal legislation laid out by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey sets goals for some drastic measures to cut carbon emissions across the economy. In the process, it aims to create jobs and boost the economy. Whether it's a deadly cold snap or a hole under an Antarctic glacier or a terrifying new report , there seem to be constant reminders now of the dangers that climate change poses to humanity. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., think they have a start to a solution. Thursday they are introducing a framework defining what they call a "Green New Deal" — what they foresee as a massive policy package that would remake the U.S. economy and, they hope, eliminate all U.S. carbon emissions. That's a really big — potentially impossibly big — undertaking. "Even the solutions that we have considered big and bold are nowhere near the scale of the actual problem that climate change presents to us," Ocasio-Cortez told NPR's Steve Inskeep in an interview that aired Thursday on Morning Edition . She added: "It could be part of a larger solution, but no one has actually scoped out what that larger solution would entail. And so that's really what we're trying to accomplish with the Green New Deal." In very broad strokes, the Green New Deal legislation laid out by Ocasio-Cortez and Markey sets goals for some drastic measures to cut carbon emissions across the economy, from electricity generation to transportation to agriculture. In the process, it aims to create jobs and boost the economy. In that vein, the proposal stresses that it aims to meet its ambitious goals while paying special attention to groups like the poor, disabled and minority communities that might be disproportionately affected by massive economic transitions like those the Green New Deal calls for. Importantly, it's a nonbinding resolution, meaning that even if it were to pass (more on the challenges to that below), it wouldn't itself create any new programs. Instead, it would potentially affirm the sense of the House that these things should be done in the coming years. Lawmakers pass nonbinding resolutions for things as simple as congratulating Super Bowl winners , as well as to send political messages — for example, telling the president they disapprove of his trade policies , as the Senate did in summer 2018. The bill calls for a "10-year national mobilizations" toward accomplishing a series of goals that the resolution lays out. (Note: Ocasio-Cortez's office released an updated version of the bill on Thursday. The earlier version, which we had included in a prior version of this story, is still available here .) Among the most prominent, the deal calls for "meeting 100 percent of the power demand in the United States through clean, renewable, and zero-emission energy sources." The ultimate goal is to stop using fossil fuels entirely, Ocasio-Cortez's office told NPR, as well as to transition away from nuclear energy. In addition, the framework, as described in the legislation as well as a blog post — containing an updated version of "FAQs" provided to NPR by Ocasio-Cortez's office — calls for a variety of other lofty goals: Which is to say: the Green New Deal framework combines big climate-change-related ideas with a wish list of progressive economic proposals that, taken together, would touch nearly every American and overhaul the economy. Many in the climate science community, as well as Green New Deal proponents, agree that saving the world from disastrous effects of climate change requires aggressive action. And some of the Green New Deal's goals are indeed aggressive. For example, Ocasio-Cortez told NPR that "in 10 years, we're trying to go carbon-neutral." According to Jesse Jenkins, a postdoctoral environmental fellow at Harvard's Kennedy School, that may be an unreachable goal. "Where we need to be targeting really is a net-zero carbon economy by about 2050, which itself is an enormous challenge and will require reductions in carbon emissions much faster than have been achieved historically," he said. "2030 might be a little bit early to be targeting." Similarly, removing combustible engines from the roads or expanding high-speed rail to largely eliminate air travel would require nothing short of revolutionizing transportation. Likewise, some of the more progressive economic policies — universal health care and a job guarantee , for example — while popular among some Democrats, would also be very difficult to implement and transition into. On top of all that, implementing all of these policies could cost trillions upon trillions of dollars. Altogether, the Green New Deal is a loose framework. It does not lay out guidance on how to implement these policies. Rather, the idea is that Ocasio-Cortez and Markey will "begin work immediately on Green New Deal bills to put the nuts and bolts on the plan described in this resolution." And again, all of this is hypothetical — it would be tough to implement and potentially extremely expensive ... if it passed. Not at all. While the Green New Deal has in the last year or so grown central to progressive Democrats' policy conversations, the idea of a Green New Deal itself is well over a decade old. Environmentalists were talking about it as far back as 2003, when the term popped up in a  San Francisco Chronicle article about an environmentalist conference. It gained traction with a 2007 New York Times column from Thomas Friedman, where he used the phrase to describe the scope of energy investments he thought would be necessary to slow climate change on a large scale. The phrase was also used around President Barack Obama's 2009 stimulus, which had around $90 billion worth of environmental initiatives. While the idea gained some currency in Europe and also in the Green Party, it wasn't until after the 2016 election that it really gained broad popularity on the left in the U.S.  (Vox's Dave Roberts has a more thorough history here ). This latest iteration is different both in the political energy that it has amassed and the grand scope it is taking. While it was a product of the progressive activist community, Ocasio-Cortez has been perhaps the most visible proponent of the plan and has helped it gain nationwide attention. That looks unlikely. Yes, there's some energy for it on the left — some House Democrats have already said they will support the bill . However, there are indications House leadership isn't prioritizing the idea as much as those more liberal Democrats would like — Speaker Nancy Pelosi frustrated Green New Deal proponents by not giving them the kind of committee they wanted to put the policies together. After the deal's Thursday release, she also cast the plan as simply one of any number of environmental proposals the House might consider. "It will be one of several or maybe many suggestions that we receive," Pelosi told Politico . "The green dream or whatever they call it, nobody knows what it is, but they're for it right?" In addition, it's easy to see how the bill could be dangerous for moderate House Democrats, many of whom come from swing districts and may be loath to touch such a progressive proposal. Among Republicans — even those worried about climate change — the package, with its liberal economic ideas, will also likely be a nonstarter. "Someone's going to have to prove to me how that can be accomplished because it looks to me like for the foreseeable future we're gonna be using a substantial amount of fossil fuels," said Rep. Francis Rooney, R-Fla., co-chair of the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus, speaking to NPR before the Green New Deal's text was released. For his part, Rooney is in favor of a carbon tax, a policy he helped propose with a bipartisan group of lawmakers in November. Information from Ocasio-Cortez's office says that the Green New Deal could include a carbon tax, but that it would be "a tiny part" of the total package of policies. Meanwhile, there's little chance of a Green New Deal getting a vote in the Republican-controlled Senate. It's worth talking about because it already is a politically powerful idea among Democrats. Already, presidential candidates are being asked whether they support the idea of a Green New Deal, meaning it's easy to see the issue becoming a litmus test for some voters in both the 2020 congressional elections and the presidential election. To more liberal Democrats, the prospect of such an ambitious economic and environmental package at the center of the 2020 campaign may be particularly energizing. "I think it's like a really weird instinct that the Democratic Party develops to not be exciting intentionally," said Sean McElwee, co-founder of the progressive think tank Data for Progress. "Most of politics is getting people excited enough to show up and vote for you. And I think that a Green New Deal and Medicare-for-all — these are ideas that are big enough to get people excited and show up to vote for you." For her part, Ocasio-Cortez says that a policy like the Green New Deal could get voters excited enough to pressure their Congress members to support it. "I do think that when there's a wide spectrum of debate on an issue, that is where the public plays a role. That is where the public needs to call their member of Congress and say, 'This is something that I care about,' " she told NPR, adding, "Where I do have trust is in my colleagues' capacity to change and evolve and be adaptable and listen to their constituents." That said, it's easy to see how a Green New Deal litmus test could backfire on that front, endangering some Democrats — particularly in swing districts. But it's not just about national politics. The national-level energy for a Green New Deal could boost efforts in cities and states. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo , for example, has been pushing a Green New Deal in his state. Aside from the politics, there's the fact that climate change remains an impending threat — one for which the world has yet to come up with a fix. "It's a big legislation because it's a huge [expletive] problem! We're all going to die," said McElwee. "Every week it seems like the risks of climate change become more real, and the amount of devastation it is going to wreak upon humanity becomes larger, and that means we have to do bigger things."

"Diplomats: EU Wrestling with Iran Nuclear Deal After American Exit","Head of Mission of People’s Republic of China to the European Union Hailong Wu, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarifat, an unidentified Russian official, British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry pose for a photo following negotiations between the P5+1 member nations and Iranian officials about the future of their country’s nuclear program at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne in Switzerland on April 2, 2015. US State Department Photo The Trump administration’s decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal leaves the European Union with the difficult choice of continuing to trade with Iran to keep up its end of the accord but also faces the loss of doing business in the United States, the EU ambassador to Washington said Wednesday. “I think Europe will live up to their commitment in the agreement,” as long as Iran does not resume its work on nuclear weapons. Daniel O’Sullivan said speaking at the Woodrow Wilson Center . He noted that the United Kingdom, France and Germany, for now, all part of the 28-member union, were signatories to the deal, along with Russia and China. All have signaled a willingness to keep the terms of the agreement in place. Lady Catherine Ashton, former vice president of the European Commission, said the agreement was unique because for the first time it brought all these nations working together on resolving a major international issue. With Trump’s decision, Russia, China, Germany, France and the United Kingdom “lose an incredibly important and vital partner” in keeping Iran from moving ahead with a nuclear weapons program to match its missile programs. Secondary sanctions, a threat by the United States to use against any company or nation continuing to trade with Iran, “is going to be a critical issue.” Complicating the relations further is the administration’s laying out the possibility of imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum shipped from the continent to the United States. O’Sullivan said several times during the Washington, D.C., forum that Iran expects an economic boost by opening up trade with other nations when it signed the agreement and lives by its literal terms. If push comes to shove on secondary sanctions for dealing with Iran, “business will make business decisions … in its own best interests,” Ashton predicted. O’Sullivan said so-called blocking actions could be taken by the EU to protect those businesses. By pulling out of the agreement because Iran is moving ahead with its ballistic and cruise missile programs, working surreptitiously to undermine governments in Yemen and other Gulf states, propping up the Syrian regime of Bashar al Assad and backing terrorists, “the U.S. is looking to change the terms of the deal,” O’Sullivan said. The more realistic course to follow was to negotiate these other points separately and keep the original agreement in place, both said in slightly different ways. O’Sullivan cited the recent visits by French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel to Washington urging the United States to work with them to negotiate the other issues with Iran. For all their differences over how to proceed with Iran and whether the American pullout of the nuclear agreement would have any impact on possible negotiations with the United States, the largest security concern for the Europeans remains Russia and what will be its next moves. O’Sullivan described the EU’s and the United States’ relationship with Russia as being a “slightly schizophrenic attitude.” On the one hand the Europeans and the United States “need to be tough and push back” against Russian aggression in Ukraine and Georgia by backing separatists in both nations and threatening other neighboring states on its western and southern borders. Ashton added in those cases and Russia’s attempted assassination by poisoning of a former spy in the United Kingdom it was essential “we stand together [and say] that’s not acceptable” by beefing up security forces and raising the economic price on the Kremlin and its leaders through a series of ever-tougher sanctions. Yet as this was going on, the EU and the United States did come together with Russia over an agreement with Iran on nuclear weapons and have worked together cooperatively in the Arctic, both diplomats agreed. O’Sullivan noted that Russia remains a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council with veto power over actions the Kremlin disagrees with and discussion on a broad range of issues between the West and Moscow were necessary to avoid misunderstanding that could lead to armed conflict. The question for the Europeans is what will their relationship be in 20 to 25 years, Ashton said. For countries on Russia’s borders, other Europeans need to realize that there are long economic and political ties and deep family connections across frontiers. “It’s about people-to-people” in the long view of events, she said.

"The Art of the Deal? Obama’s With Iran Was Much Better Than Trump’s With North Korea","The Singapore statement pales even in comparison with the interim, preliminary Iran deal signed by the U.S. and other world powers in 2013. ISTANBUL — One was the result of 12 years of painstaking negotiations over two U.S. presidential administrations and three changes of government on the other side, with the U.N. Security Council, the International Atomic Energy Agency, and leaders from the capitals of half a dozen countries actively involved. The other was hammered out by two beefy guys with bad hair during the equivalent of a long layover in Singapore. It may be unfair to compare the 159-page Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the Iran nuclear deal , signed by Tehran and world powers in 2015, to the barely two-page Singapore declaration penned by Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un, which is supposed to kick off the process of a deal. But the Singapore statement, which has been praised by Trump supporters and conservative pundits on cable television, also pales dramatically in comparison to the interim deal that Iran, the U.S. and other world powers signed in 2013. That four-page document , called the Joint Plan of Action and signed in Geneva on November 24, 2013, ultimately paved the way for the JCPOA, which arms control experts generally regarded as an imperfect but effective way of preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, but Trump repeatedly has called the “worst deal” ever. Republicans hostile to Barack Obama blasted the Iran deal as appeasing a brutal regime. In contrast, pundits on Fox News lauded Trump for his diplomatic prowess in meeting with North Korea’s leader. “If it was a Democratic president he or she would have been heavily criticized for just sitting down with Kim Jong Un,” said Darryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association. “ The Singapore statement is a very basic framework document that sets out the goals for a future negotiations. It is not a deal. It is not a plan. It is not a clearly spelled out a set of steps.” To the cheers of conservatives in Washington and U.S. allies the Middle East, Trump pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal last month, saying that the agreement failed to serve U.S. interests. He vowed to pressure the other signatories to abide by unilateral American sanctions in order to pressure Tehran into  signing onto a “better deal.” Trump also hopes to best his predecessors by drawing nuclear-armed North Korea into a comprehensive deal that will denuclearize the Korean peninsula and lower tensions across northeast Asia. But critics say that in contrast to the Obama administration’s approach to Iran negotiations, Trump’s has been too vague, has given away too many concessions already, and has excluded allies that could give Washington precious leverage. “We see big headline statements that are going to be hard to assess,” said Ellie Geranmayeh, senior fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, and an expert on the Iran deal. “How you can measure performance, especially in North Korea?” The document the U.S., Iran, E.U., Russia, and China signed in 2013 included specific actions to be undertaken by each party over the following six months, renewable by mutual consent if talks were progressing. “It required Iran to take some significant measures on its nuclear program that were verifiable and measurable in return for some minimal sanctions easing,” said Geranmayeh. In contrast, the Singapore declaration — at least on paper (and what else is there?) — lacks any specific actions or dates, committing Pyongyang to merely “work towards the complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.” From the start of the Iran deal, negotiators understood that any vagueness could spell trouble. In the best case scenario, diplomats and experts spend the months after an initial declaration winnowing down overly broad statements into tangible changes that improve the security architecture of one of the most dangerous regions on the planet. In a likelier scenario, Kim takes advantage of the lack of benchmarks and deadlines, banks his diplomatic successes, keeps his head down, and quietly builds up his arsenal of weapons while hoping Trump gets distracted. In a worst-case scenario, imprecise language leads to misunderstanding. “ This statement is so vague and poorly written, Trump might get spun up into believing the North Koreans are violating the deal and you get back into the cycle of escalatory rhetoric,” said Jarrett Blanc, a former Iran nuclear deal negotiator now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Obama sought to meet with Iran’s moderate president, Hassan Rouhani, but only managed a phone call . Kimball praised Trump for meeting with Kim Jong Un, calling it a bold move that could set the tone for a future agreement. “It’s an effective way of cutting through the bureaucratic morass,” he said. “Sitting down with your adversary is not a concession.” But others criticized Trump for giving Kim other concessions without getting anything in return. Though the deal didn’t stipulate anything about military exercises, Trump at a press conference suggested joint military operations with South Korea would be suspended during the course of any negotiations — this in exchange for a halt to nuclear tests experts say the North Koreans likely no longer need. Trump also discussed lowering U.S. troop numbers, calling the continued American presence on the Korean Peninsula “too expensive,” and floated a possible White House invite for Kim. In the joint statement, Trump also “committed to provide security guarantees” to North Korea, which critics contend was far too big a promise, or just sloppy wording. “In the past the U.S. talks about security ‘assurances’; they talk about a security ‘ guarantee’ — it’s batshit crazy,” said Blanc. “I’m concerned about what appear to be largely unreciprocated concessions from the U.S. And I am more concerned that it genuinely does not seem that Trump understands that he has made concessions.” Again, by comparison every step of the Iran deal was carefully calibrated, with easing of sanctions and freezing of assets coming only in return for verifiable steps in rolling back Tehran’s nuclear program. “There’s really no comparison between the highly structured organized way the Iran process was begun, and this,” said Blanc. Iran’s nuclear program was for years under international scrutiny, with inspections by the U.N.’s International Atomic Energy Agency, or IAEA, tightening as the JCPOA went into effect. North Korea, which withdrew years ago from the international nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, has repeatedly welcomed and booted out inspectors, announcing that it would ramp up enrichment or test weapons. The Singapore declaration makes no mention of any role for the IAEA, which somewhat awkwardly released a statement announcing that it “stands ready” to help out on any inspections. The lack of the IAEA participation underscores perhaps the biggest shortcoming of the Singapore declaration, as well Trump’s Gonzo-style diplomacy, compared to the carefully choreographed process that led up to Iran deal: a lack of cooperation by U.S. allies and other global players. Under both Presidents George W. Bush and Obama, the U.S. worked closely with allies like the U.K. and France and other world powers in efforts to ratchet up pressure on Iran to get it to come to the negotiating table. In contrast, Trump seems to have repeatedly caught the crucial players in the North Korea talks off guard. Announcing the talks in the first place surprised China and Russia, key trading partners of North Korea, and the move to float a possible suspension of military exercises appeared to surprise U.S. allies South Korea and Japan. By failing to coordinate his moves with partners, Trump has foregone precious potential leverage over North Korea. Both Beijing and Moscow are praising the Singapore meeting, but instead of maximizing pressure on Pyongyang, China and Russia and others are scrambling to bolster ties with North  Korea ahead of a potential U.S. rapprochement with the country. Even Malaysia, which severed ties with North Korea last year over the bizarre chemical weapon assassination of Kim’s half brother at the Kuala Lumpur airport, quickly announced it was restoring relations with Pyongyang in the wake of the Trump deal. Though Trump said there would be no easing of sanctions for North Korea until it rolls back its nuclear weapons program, China is already agitating for economic relief. “It was always going to be difficult to get China to pressure North Korea,” said Blanc. “As soon as Trump announced the summit without consulting the Chinese, the pressure was over.” Got a tip?

President Trump made an announcement from the White House, keeping his campaign promise, that the United States would withdraw from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, also known as the Iran nuclear deal. John Fritze reports. John Fritze, USA TODAY WASHINGTON – As he announced Tuesday that he would no longer abide by the Iran nuclear deal, President Trump sent a not-so-veiled message to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. "Today's action sends a critical message: The United States no longer makes empty threats. When I make promises, I keep them," Trump said. Even as he spoke, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was on his way to the Korean Peninsula to lay the groundwork for talks about North Korea's nuclear program. "Plans are being made; relationships are building. Hopefully, a deal will happen," Trump said. The very same issues that caused Trump to pull out of the Iran agreement will also be hurdles in North Korea talks — and in some cases, those hurdles will be higher. Unlike Iran, North Korea already has nuclear weapons. "Ripping up the Iran deal will demonstrate to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un that a deal with the United States can't be counted on. And it will give Kim Jong Un less incentive to make important concessions," said Robert Einhorn of the Brookings Institution, a former State Department adviser on arms control during the Obama administration. Einhorn said Trump's position on the Iran deal could box him in on negotiations with North Korea. On sanctions relief, human rights and missile technology, Trump may be setting a standard on Iran that could be impossible to reach on a North Korea deal. Trump has four major problems with the Iran deal, which was negotiated by President Obama and five other world powers and is formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. •The JCPOA didn't address Iran's ballistic missile program. •It didn't stop Iran's misbehavior in the Middle East. • Provisions of the agreement expire after 10 to 15 years. •It rewarded Iran by unfreezing its assets frozen by years of U.S. sanctions.  Trump is moving quickly toward a historic summit with Kim in the coming weeks, bypassing the years of lower-level talks that preceded the Iran nuclear deal. "The location is picked — the time and the date, everything is picked," Trump said. An Obama-era law requires Trump to make a decision on Iran sanctions every 120 days. The previous time he faced that deadline, Trump waived the sanctions. Tuesday, he signed a presidential memorandum to pull out of the agreement, allowing him to impose the sanctions. "They're not formally linked, but clearly, they’re linked in many people's minds. They're two rogue regimes on different parts of the timeline toward developing a nuclear program," said Bruce Klingner, a former CIA analyst on North Korea now at the conservative Heritage Foundation. Because North Korea is further along on that timeline — it's  suspected of having a nuclear stockpile of as many as 60 warheads — Iran and other potential nuclear states will watch to see what Kim can get away with. "The Trump administration has set a very high bar for success and painted itself into a corner through its very strong opposition — to not just the JCPOA but other agreements with North Korea," Klingner said. An agreement in 1994 with North Korea, negotiated by the Clinton administration and known as the Agreed Framework, slowed North Korea's nuclear program for eight years. The pact collapsed during the George W. Bush administration — in part because of North Korean provocations, but the United States didn't live up to its promise to help North Korea develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. "One would think that the U.S. pulling out of the Iran deal would undermine North Korea's perception that it could trust the U.S. to maintain any kind of agreement with it," Klingner said. "The North Koreans already think that the U.S. political system is fickle. We change our policy every four to eight years." That cuts both ways. Just as Iran learned that a U.S. president might not maintain an agreement his predecessor made, both countries may calculate that the next U.S. president might give them a better deal.","https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/05/08/iran-nuclear-deal-what-does-trumps-move-mean-north-korea-talks/586711002/"
"Who’s Most Endangered By Trump’s Iran Deal Exit? Israel, Say Its Army Chiefs","After months of intense, worldwide speculation, Donald Trump finally pulled the trigger on U.S. participation in the Iran nuclear deal with his May 8 statement decertifying the deal and restoring sanctions on Iran.  He’d been begged by the top leaders of America’s European allies to compromise, to let the deal’s framework stand and give them time to press Iran for improvements. Instead, he snubbed them and adopted the most extreme, most misleading arguments of the deal’s most extreme opponents for full, immediate withdrawal from the deal. The results won’t be pretty. Realistically, the Iran nuclear debate has always come down to diplomacy versus action, probably the military kind. In the coming months we’ll probably witness either a new concordat between Iran, Russia, China and the Europeans, with America shoved powerless to the sidelines, or a U.S.-led invasion to topple the regime, as we did in Iraq 15 years ago. It was the Iraq invasion, in fact, that directly caused the current crisis by removing Iran’s main enemy, Saddam Hussein, and replacing him with a government democratically led by Iraq’s Shia majority, Iran’s natural ally. The U.S. invasion fulfilled Iran’s long-held dream of a Shi’ite Crescent, a continuous land bridge from the Pakistan border westward across Iran and Iraq to Syria and Lebanon on the Mediterranean. Iraqi regime change turned Iran into the regional superpower it is today. Iranian regime change? There’s no telling what unintended consequences it might bring. Trump argued that the deal’s enforcement mechanisms are inadequate, and complained that they are scheduled to expire in a “in just a short time” — a decade from the deal’s 2015 signing — and thus leave Iran “on the cusp of acquiring the world’s most dangerous weapons.” That is, the mechanisms don’t work, and what’s worse, they’re going to expire. Rather like the old Borscht Belt joke about the visitor who complained that the food was lousy and the portions were too small. Trump also argued that Iran continues to harbor ambitions of nuclear weaponry, but falsely claimed it didn’t, meaning the whole deal was based on a lie. That’s supposedly proven by Israeli-acquired documents detailing Iran’s plans — even though the documents date from before Iran accepted the deal. Of course, anyone who’s followed events knows that the West was fully aware of Iran’s lies before, during and after the negotiating. That, in fact, is the reason for the West’s insistence on highly intrusive inspections. Ironically, the actual basis of the deal is an argument that Netanyahu himself put forward years ago. Addressing the United Nations General Assembly in September 2012, memorably armed with a cartoon drawing of a bomb, Netanyahu argued that Iran must be brought to heel precisely because it is a bad actor in the region and would be infinitely more dangerous if it had a nuclear weapons. “Just imagine Iranian aggression with nuclear weapons,” Netanyahu told the U.N. There is, he said, “only one way to peacefully prevent Iran from getting atomic bombs. That’s by placing a clear red line on Iran’s nuclear weapons program.” And that’s what the remarkable global coalition of America, Europe, Russia and China demanded and got from Iran in the 2015 deal. For all that, Netanyahu probably emerges as the biggest winner from Trump’s decision. For years he’s been a lonely voice on the world stage, warning against Iranian nukes as a threat to world peace and to Israel’s very survival. Once the talks got going, though, he moved his own goalposts from preventing a bomb to a none-too-subtle push toward regime change .  At a time when Netanyahu is plagued by corruption probes and a tense coalition, Trump’s timing couldn’t be sweeter. Indeed, quick polls conducted after the Trump announcement show Netanyahu scoring higher in a theoretical election than he has in his nine years in office. And yet, paradoxically, the biggest loser in Trump’s announcement is probably the security of Israel itself in the face of its Iranian foe. That’s the near-unanimous view of Israel’s top military leadership. Just weeks ago, on March 25, four of the six living former chiefs of Israel’s military command shared a stage in Tel Aviv and stated unanimously that canceling the Iran deal would hurt Israel, not help it. Of the other two ex-chiefs, one, former prime minister Ehud Barak, once partnered with Netanyahu in a 2010 plan to bomb Iran’s nuclear facilities. Barak flipped last fall, however, and publicly called for maintaining the diplomats’ deal. The sixth retiree, Gabi Ashkenazi, led the group of security chiefs who thwarted the 2010 Netanyahu-Barak attack plan. In late April Ashkenazi endorsed “nixing” the current deal at a New York symposium, although, given his record, he may have been angling for right-wing support as he prepares to enter politics. Even the current chief of staff, Gadi Eisenkot, has weighed in, declaring in an interview shortly after the ex-chiefs’ forum that the Iran deal, “with all its faults, is working.” At the March forum, the four retired generals were asked their opinion of the nuclear deal, since Trump’s deadline for deciding its fate was just six weeks away. They all agreed that while the deal is flawed, scrapping it would be worse from Israel’s standpoint. For one thing, they said, the deal is working as planned. Iran has halted its bomb program and dismantled its main components. For another, the deal’s partial expiration in 10 years gives Israel and the West a decade to develop other methods of restraining Iran. At the moment, Israel has more urgent problems with growing unrest in Gaza and likely West Bank violence on May 15, the 70th anniversary of Israeli independence that Palestinians mark as the anniversary of their Nakba, or “disaster.” Also on the immediate agenda is the increasing entrenchment of Iran’s conventional military presence in Syria, across Israel’s northeastern border. Yet another critical point was raised by Mofaz and elaborated by former chief of staff Benny Gantz: that an American withdrawal would leave Washington on the sidelines, isolated in world affairs and less able to protect Israel. That could be a strategic setback of monumental dimensions.

"Iran Agrees to Detailed Nuclear Outline, First Step Toward a Wider Deal","Advertisement Supported by By  Michael R. Gordon and David E. Sanger LAUSANNE, Switzerland — Iran and the United States, along with five other world powers, announced on Thursday a surprisingly specific and comprehensive understanding on limiting Tehran’s nuclear program for the next 15 years, though they left several specific issues to a final agreement in June. After two years of negotiations, capped by eight tumultuous days and nights of talks that appeared on the brink of breakdown several times, Secretary of State John Kerry and his Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif, announced the plan, which, if carried out, would keep Iran’s nuclear facilities open under strict production limits, and which holds the potential of reordering America’s relationship with a country that has been an avowed adversary for 35 years. Mr. Kerry and Energy Secretary Ernest J. Moniz, a nuclear scientist who played a crucial role in the last stages of the negotiations, said the pact satisfied their primary goal of ensuring that Iran, if it decided to, could not race for a nuclear weapon in less than a year, although those constraints against “breakout” would be in effect only for the first decade of the accord. President Obama, for whom remaking the American relationship with Iran has been a central objective since his 2008 campaign, stepped into the Rose Garden moments later to celebrate what he called “a historic understanding with Iran.” He warned Republicans in Congress that if they tried to impose new sanctions to undermine the effort, the United States would be blamed for a diplomatic failure. He insisted that the deal “cuts off every pathway” for Iran to develop a nuclear weapon and establishes the most intrusive inspection system in history. “If Iran cheats,” he said, “the world will know it.” Under the accord, Iran agreed to cut the number of operating centrifuges it has by two-thirds, to 5,060, all of them first-generation, and to cut its current stockpile of low-enriched uranium from around 10,000 kilograms to 300 for 15 years. An American description of the deal also referred to inspections “anywhere in the country” that could “investigate suspicious sites or allegations of a covert enrichment facility.” But in a briefing, American officials talked about setting up a mechanism to resolve disputes that has not been explained in any detail. In a move not seen since before the Iranian revolution in 1979, and to the surprise of many in both countries, Iranian government broadcasters aired Mr. Obama’s comments live. In parts of Tehran, people cheered and honked car horns as they began to contemplate a life without sanctions on oil and financial transactions, though the issue of when the sanctions are to be removed looms as one of the potential obstacles to a final agreement on June 30. If that hurdle and the problem of ridding Iran of its huge nuclear fuel stockpile can be fully resolved in the next three months, the preliminary accord will still need to be sold to Iran’s neighbors. The prospect of a deal has inflamed Israel and the Gulf states, alarmed by Iranian muscle-flexing in the Middle East, most recently in Iraq, Syria and Yemen. There is so much concern that Mr. Obama, in a phone call today to King Salman of Saudi Arabia, invited Arab leaders to Camp David this spring to discuss Iran and the turmoil in the region. Analysts have long been worried that Saudi Arabia and other Arab states might mount their own nuclear programs if they decide that Iran is being allowed to retain too much of its nuclear infrastructure. In a telephone call from Air Force One on Thursday afternoon, Mr. Obama told Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, that while the deal was not final, it “represents significant progress towards a lasting, comprehensive solution that cuts off all of Iran’s pathways to a bomb and verifiably ensures the peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear program going forward,” according to an account of the conversation from the White House. Mr. Netanyahu, a strong critic of the deal, was apparently not mollified, and released a statement saying, “A deal based on this framework would threaten the survival of Israel.” Mr. Zarif, for his part, was careful to play down the notion that anything agreed to here would remake the relationship. Any hint of a broader rapprochement is an enormously sensitive issue among hard-liners in the Iranian military and clerical leaders who have made opposition to the United States the centerpiece of their political narratives. “Iran-U.S. relations have nothing to do with this,” Mr. Zarif said emphatically at a university here, where the agreement was announced. “This was an attempt to resolve the nuclear issue.” While saying he hoped the two countries would find a way to melt away their distrust as the agreement was carried out, he hastened to add, “We have serious differences with the United States.” Now, attention will shift to Mr. Obama and Hassan Rouhani, the Iranian president, who was elected on a platform of ending sanctions. They share a common task: selling the agreement at home to constituencies deeply suspicious of both the deal and the prospect of signing any accord with an avowed enemy. The White House has promised a lobbying campaign by the president unlike any seen since he pushed through health care legislation. Mr. Zarif and other Iranian officials may have an even harder political argument to win. They will have to overcome objections in the military and scientific establishments, especially because the accord will force them to cut the number of centrifuges enriching uranium by half, put thousands of others in storage and convert two other facilities into research sites that would have virtually no fissile material — the makings of an atom bomb. Iran has insisted that its nuclear program is for civilian uses only. Mr. Zarif seemed to sense the scope of the challenge in how he framed the agreement. He focused on the fact that Iran would not have to dismantle any facilities — something Washington had initially demanded, especially after helping expose one such secret facility, called Fordo, in Mr. Obama’s first year in office. When, late on Thursday, the White House began distributing a description of what amounted to Iranian concessions, an obviously angry Mr. Zarif challenged the American accounting in several posts on Twitter. Whether Iran is racing toward nuclear weapon capabilities is one of the most contentious foreign-policy issues challenging the West. “There is no need to spin using ‘fact sheets’ so early on,” he wrote in one , only an hour or so after. In another, he suggested that sanctions would have to be lifted far earlier than one might think listening to Mr. Kerry, saying that, in essence, all the economic sanctions would be lifted once a final agreement was signed. That could be another issue for the two sides, in that Washington has insisted that the sanctions be removed in a step-by-step manner as Iran fulfills its obligations under the agreement. At another point, Mr. Zarif cautioned that no one had signed anything in Lausanne, and “nobody has obligations now.” That would come after a final agreement. A guide to help you navigate the deal between global powers and Tehran. Another problem for Mr. Zarif is that the deal he has agreed to is far more restrictive than one he outlined last July in an interview with The New York Times . At that time, he envisioned essentially keeping Iran’s stockpiles and its sprawling nuclear facilities at the levels they are running under a temporary agreement struck 18 months ago. What he agreed to in Lausanne, at least according to those fact sheets, would drastically cut Iran’s capability for 10 years and then allow it to build up gradually for the next five. After that, Iran would be free to produce as much uranium as it wishes — even building the 190,000 centrifuges that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei talked about last summer. That is bound to be a major concern for Congress, the Israelis and the Arab states, because it amounts to a bet that after 15 years, Iran will be a far more cooperative international player, perhaps under different management. The 5,060 centrifuges is a far higher figure than the administration originally envisioned, when it argued that Iran could possess only a few hundred. But in the final negotiations, Mr. Moniz and his Iranian counterpart, Ali Akbar Salehi, the M.I.T.-educated head of Iran’s atomic energy agency, agreed that Iran would drastically cut its stockpile of nuclear fuel, from about eight tons to a little over 600 pounds. The giant underground enrichment site at Fordo, which Israeli and some American officials fear is impervious to bombing, would be partly converted to advanced nuclear research and the production of medical isotopes. About two thirds of its centrifuges would be removed. Eventually, foreign scientists would be present. It would have no fissile material that could be used to make a bomb. But perhaps the most important compromise came in a lengthy battle over whether Iran would be allowed to conduct research and development on advanced centrifuges, which are far more efficient than current models. The Iranians won the right to research, but not to use more modern machines for production for the next 10 years. At Arak, which officials feared could produce plutonium, another pathway to a bomb, Iran agreed to redesign a heavy-water reactor in a way that would keep it from producing weapons-usable fuel. Those conditions impressed two of the most skeptical experts on the negotiations: Gary Samore and Olli Heinonen of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard and members of a group called United Against Nuclear Iran. Mr. Samore, who was Mr. Obama’s top adviser on weapons of mass destruction in his first term as president, said in an email that the deal was a “very satisfactory resolution of Fordo and Arak issues for the 15-year term” of the accord. He had more questions about operations at Natanz and said there was “much detail to be negotiated, but I think it’s enough to be called a political framework.” Mr. Heinonen, the former chief inspector of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said, “It appears to be a fairly comprehensive deal with most important parameters.” But he cautioned that “Iran maintains enrichment capacity which will be beyond its near-term needs.” Thomas Erdbrink contributed reporting from Tehran, and Julie Hirschfeld Davis from Washington. video Advertisement","https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/03/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-talks.html"
"Iran Rallies Against U.S. and Warns Europe Over Endangered Nuclear Deal","Advertisement Supported by By  Thomas Erdbrink and Rick Gladstone TEHRAN — Iran’s hard-line authorities organized nationwide rallies on Friday to denounce the Trump administration’s withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear agreement, burning American flags and warning that Europe might further sabotage the accord. The reaction reflected the view held by many hard-liners that the American withdrawal had vindicated their suspicions that Westerners were treacherous. The anger on display in Tehran and other cities also reinforced the possibility that Iran would now abandon the agreement as well, restarting the nuclear-fuel enrichment that it had halted. Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami, a well-known hard-liner who leads the Friday Prayer services in Tehran, admonished fellow citizens against making any deals with foreigners “since they cannot be trusted.” In his sermon, broadcast on state television, Ayatollah Khatami also criticized Iranian politicians who have looked toward Europe to preserve the nuclear agreement, arguing that the Europeans, too, have broken promises. The outpouring of anger, in demonstrations organized around the country, was the most strident so far to President Trump’s announcement on Tuesday that he was abandoning the nuclear agreement reached with Iran and other major powers three years ago. The agreement relaxed or ended many economic restrictions on Iran in return for its verifiable pledges to never make nuclear weapons, including a freeze on nuclear fuel production for at least 15 years. Mr. Trump called the agreement too weak and described it as a shameful giveaway to Iran by his predecessor, Barack Obama. Mr. Trump’s announcement restored onerous American sanctions on Iran, including penalties for foreign companies that do business with that country. His announcement was widely criticized around the world but drew praise from Iran’s regional enemies, Israel and Saudi Arabia. While European governments have said they want to preserve the accord, the participation of the United States was widely considered to be crucial to its survival. Even before Mr. Trump announced the pullout, non-American businesses were wary about making any financial commitments in Iran, fearful of such an outcome. Many Iranians, who had hoped the nuclear accord would bring a flood of investment and business to the country of 80 million, have been deeply disappointed. Reminding Iranians of this point, Ayatollah Khatami said Europeans had been expected to invest in Iran after the nuclear agreement took effect but most never did. He exhorted listeners to shout “Death to America!” and “Death to Israel!” In response to what Israel has described as its aerial assaults on Iranian bases in Syria, Ayatollah Khatami also said that Iran would “rob the Israeli regime of sleep” and threatened to “raze Tel Aviv and Haifa to the ground.” The American withdrawal from the nuclear accord is considered a serious political blow to Hassan Rouhani, Iran’s president, who had promised that the agreement would end the country’s prolonged isolation and economic travails. The withdrawal also reinforced the anti-American hostility of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, who reluctantly had gone along with Mr. Rouhani and his nuclear negotiators. The mood at Friday Prayer services was defiant in Tehran, where men burned American flags. One worshiper, Hassan Khedri, 24, with spiky hair and a sleeveless shirt, said: “I am an Iranian Kurd and I am ready to fight with America and Israel. I only wait for the command of the chief commander, our Supreme Leader Khamenei.” Another worshiper, Hasan Biagi, 65, said the threat to the nuclear agreement caused by the American pullout showed the true faces of Iran’s enemies. “We cannot even rely on Europe,” he said. “This is a big lesson for us. Never trust the West.” The mistrust was an underlying theme in a statement issued by the government on Thursday denouncing what it called Mr. Trump’s “new extremist administration” for exiting the agreement. “Mr. Trump’s absurd insults against the great Iranian nation indicate the extent of his ignorance and folly,” the statement said. Warning the agreement’s European participants — Britain, France and Germany — the statement said they “must take the necessary action to safeguard the accord and to implement their commitments — which they proved incapable of fully performing even while the U.S. was nominally a party to the deal.” Ayatollah Khamenei also expressed skepticism about whether the Europeans would keep their word. In a speech on Wednesday to teachers in Tehran, he hinted that the nuclear agreement would fail. “I do not trust these three countries either,” he said. “Do not trust them. If you want to sign a contract, ask for actual guarantees. I swear to God, they will do the same thing that the Americans did.” Resentment and resistance toward Mr. Trump’s decision also appeared to be deepening in Europe, where many officials view it as an arrogant act that could force European companies to acquiesce to American policy toward Iran. “Do we want the United States to be the world’s economic gendarme?” Bruno Le Maire, France’s minister of economy and finances, said on the Europe 1 radio station. “Or do we Europeans want to say: ‘We have economic interests, we want to continue trading with Iran within the framework of a strategic agreement. We believe that this is the right approach, so we will continue.’” Even so, there were new signs on Friday that some big non-American companies were heeding the White House’s warning to wind down commercial commitments in Tehran. The Treasury Department, which oversees American sanctions policy, has given businesses 90 to 180 days before it starts enforcing penalties. Two leading shipping companies, Maersk Line and MSC, said they were reviewing their Iran operations, and Indonesia’s state energy company, Pertamina, said it might delay a contract to operate Iran’s Mansouri oil field, Reuters reported. The American restoration of sanctions also annulled the export licenses of leading aerospace companies to sell commercial aircraft to Iran, upending multibillion-dollar orders won by Boeing and Airbus. Boeing has played down the fallout , saying it had not committed to any production for Iran. Airbus, which has already delivered a few aircraft to Iran, has not specified what it will do. Although Airbus is a European company, it needs an American export license because Airbus planes contain some American components. “We’re carefully analyzing the president’s announcement and will be evaluating next steps consistent with our internal policies and in full compliance with U.S. sanctions and export control regulations,” Airbus said in an emailed statement. “That analysis could take a bit of time.” Thomas Erdbrink reported from Tehran, and Rick Gladstone from New York.

"US trying to move forward after quitting Iran nuclear deal","WASHINGTON (AFP) — After leaving the Iran nuclear deal, Washington wants to move forward by offering to build a “coalition” to counter the multiple “threats” posed by the Tehran regime — but Europeans intent on saving the 2015 accord may thwart that effort. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday will unveil a new “diplomatic roadmap” for Iran — how America plans to “address the totality of Iran’s threats,” according to the State Department’s director of policy planning, Brian Hook. Washington is looking to draft a “new security architecture and a better security framework, a better deal,” Hook told reporters ahead of the speech, the first major policy address by Pompeo since he became America’s top diplomat.  Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories  Free Sign Up  “The US will be working hard to put together a coalition,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said, flagging Washington’s bid for a multilateral approach after its unilateral withdrawal from the accord. President Donald Trump has long trashed the deal with Iran — concluded under his predecessor Barack Obama, together with Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia — saying it did not do enough to curtail Tehran’s nuclear ambitions. The Republican leader also said it did not go far enough in restricting Iran’s ballistic missile program, or its intervention in regional conflicts from Yemen to Iraq and Syria. “We need a new — a framework that’s going to address the totality of Iran’s threats,” Hook said. So far, the guidelines of this new strategy are unclear. The big unknown is whether European leaders, who were bitterly disappointed by Trump’s decision to ditch the deal, would be willing to return to talks with his administration any time soon. For now, the European Union is trying to persuade Iran to stay in the 2015 agreement, even without Washington’s participation. The re-establishment of the US sanctions that were lifted after the Iran nuclear deal was signed will force European companies to choose between investing in Iran or trading with the United States. In reality, there is no choice — European companies cannot afford to forsake the US market. And with investment from Europe — which had been the main carrot dangled before the Iranians to right their struggling economy — now stymied, Tehran may have little incentive to hold up its end of the bargain. The Europeans have tried to squeeze a little flexibility out of Washington to help out their firms, but to no avail. “They tell us, ‘We want the sanctions to hurt, there won’t be any exemptions,'” said one European official. Some in the US administration are calling for a “North Korea scenario,” meaning the imposition of sanctions so severe that they force Iran back to the negotiating table. By reimposing the sanctions, Washington aims to “bring economic pressure to bear on Iran,” Hook said. “It was economic pressure that brought the Iranians to the table a few years ago.” But Jake Sullivan, a former Obama administration official who is now a researcher at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said “the idea that we are going to be able to reconstruct sanctions at the same level (as 2015) is a flawed concept.” “The more aggressive the US is in telling the Europeans basically, ‘We have you under our thumbs,’ the more the Europeans are going to say: ‘We will find any means we possibly can to not let you do that to us,'” he said Friday. Washington has meanwhile sought to downplay the differences with its allies. “We agree with the Europeans on much, much more than we disagree on,” said Hook, citing “a lot of progress” during talks with Paris, London and Berlin that aimed to find solutions to Trump’s concerns. The US official also mentioned French President Emmanuel Macron’s proposal of a “new deal,” based on the 2015 accord, but offering a broader strategy on Iran. But those negotiations, and Macron’s proposal, pre-dated the abrupt US withdrawal from the accord. Are they still on the table? And how could an accord be reached now if it was impossible 10 days ago? “We are waiting to see more details,” said a European official. Another European official warned: “But if it is a question of building a coalition to push for regime change in Iran, the Europeans won’t be on board.” For Sullivan, the next phase is one in which “the punishment is the strategy — squeezing Iran and keeping them in the penalty box for as long as possible, and as much as possible, with the hope of regime change, but if it’s not regime change, (then) a weaker regime.”","https://www.timesofisrael.com/us-trying-to-move-forward-after-quitting-iran-nuclear-deal/"
"Nuclear deal Trump seeks with North Korea could mirror Iran deal he hates","President Trump says he wants to strike a nuclear deal with North Korea that would benefit “the whole world” by neutralizing a looming threat, and he is willing to trade economic concessions to help make it happen. That sounds a lot like the bargain President Barack Obama made with Iran in the international nuclear deal that Trump ripped up earlier this month. Trump has cast the Obama administration’s efforts as the work of overeager and naive negotiators who got fleeced by Tehran, while he will bring a master dealmaker’s approach to his talks with Pyongyang. The result, he says, will be a great deal or a return to the “maximum pressure” approach he took toward Kim Jong Un at the start of his presidency. “I think it’s going to be a very big success,” the president said during a May 10 campaign rally in Indiana. “But my attitude is: And if it isn’t, it isn’t. Okay? If it isn’t, it isn’t.” Trump’s divergent views of the two nuclear negotiations, despite their similarities, underscore two of the main drivers of his foreign policy approach — a desire to tear down what Obama put in place and his belief that he can tackle the in­trac­table problems that his predecessors failed to resolve. So far, Trump has revealed little about the specifics of what he wants out of his meeting next month with Kim beyond getting North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons. He has suggested he would like to strike an accord with Kim that would serve as the framework for more detailed negotiations. The Trump administration has given no estimate for how long the negotiation might take. However long the bargaining lasts, the boundaries of a North Korea deal and the basic playbook to get that deal would roughly mirror the Iran pact, diplomats and analysts said. The essential trade-off of weapons or potential weapons for economic and other incentives is a diplomatic staple that long predates Trump. “The Iran nuclear talks were extraordinarily complex and difficult,” spanning 10 years and two administrations from the start of the sanctions pressure campaign to a deal, said former senior State Department official R. Nicholas Burns. “The North Korea case is even more challenging because, unlike Iran, the regime has nuclear weapons and will not want to give them up at all costs. The North Koreans will be frustrating and tendentious and the deal the U.S. likely desires is roughly equivalent to the Iran deal Trump just disavowed.” Trump’s decision on Iran reimposed economic sanctions that had been suspended under the 2015 deal and which have been the model for some of the sanctions architecture erected against North Korea. As with Iran, the North Korea sanctions are a mix of U.S. and international restrictions intended to squeeze the country’s ruling elite and draw the leadership to the bargaining table. The parallels don’t stop there. Both cases involve a secretive nation with a history of nuclear development and alleged deception, as well as a national narrative of enmity with the United States. Iran claims it never sought nuclear weapons but nonetheless agreed under the deal to curb nuclear activity it said was related to energy and other peaceful uses. North Korea already has a nuclear weapons arsenal and claims to be able to target the entire United States. Both cases involve the threat of U.S. military force to stop the advance of a nuclear threat, and the dangling of negotiations as a better alternative. Trump famously threatened last year that he would rain “fire and fury” on North Korea if it menaced the United States or its allies. Both cases involve agreements with other countries that have leverage and a stake in the outcome. The United States would need China and South Korea, at the least, to make any deal with North Korea stick, and the United Nations would probably be asked to back a North Korean nuclear deal much as it backed the Iran accord. Trump hasn’t said how he will negotiate a deal with North Korea that will be superior to past international agreements, except by being willing to leave the table if discussions aren’t going his way. If he secures an agreement, Trump will be under pressure to show how he would address what he called the deficiencies in scope and duration of the Iran deal. Notably for North Korea, Trump blasted the Iran deal for failing to address that country’s ballistic missile capability. Trump also complained that Iran was cheating on the deal, but verifying that North Korea is complying with any agreement could be far more difficult given how opaque it has been to the outside world for decades. Trump and Kim are scheduled to meet on June 12 for an unprecedented face-to-face negotiation that Trump said has one simple goal: “They give up their nukes.” Planning for the meeting is going ahead, Trump said Thursday, despite surprise statements from Pyongyang this week that put the session in doubt. “If the meeting happens, it happens and if it doesn’t we go on to the next step,” Trump said matter-of-factly. “North Korea is talking to us. We are continuing to negotiate when to meet, how to meet. They’ve been negotiating like nothing happened.” His tone was more upbeat last week, but the message was the same: He wants to talk but would not make what he calls the mistakes of his predecessor. “We’re not going to walk into an Iran deal,” he said. Some analysts caution not to draw too close of a comparison between the Iran deal and Trump’s negotiations with Kim. “President Trump’s exiting the Iran nuclear deal is regrettable but not inconsistent with his pursuing North Korea’s denuclearization,” said Patrick McEachern, a public policy fellow and North Korea specialist at the Wilson Center who is the author of a book comparing the Iranian and North Korean challenges. “President Trump’s effort to get North Korea to give up an existing nuclear arsenal and the means to reconstitute it is a much taller task than President Obama’s concentration on preventing a nuclear weapons-free Iran from getting the bomb in the first place.” Comparing the two situations is “a bit apples to oranges,” since Iran did not have a full-fledged weapons of mass destruction program and the goal of the deal was to prevent one, said Jenny Town, editor of the North Korea information clearinghouse 38 North. But more than that difference, Trump’s disdain for the Iran deal is rooted in the fact it was struck under Obama’s watch. “This is more a case of, the deal is bad because it wasn’t his deal, more than anything else,” Town said.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/nuclear-deal-trump-seeks-with-north-korea-could-mirror-iran-deal-he-hates/2018/05/18/e6766ab8-5955-11e8-b656-a5f8c2a9295d_story.html"

"John Bolton will reportedly meet with Israeli national security adviser to ratify joint approach to Iran","US National Security Adviser John Bolton will reportedly meet with his Israeli counterpart, Meir Ben-Shabat, in Washington on Tuesday to discuss a joint approach to Iran. Sources briefed on the trip told Israel's Channel 10 reporter Barak Ravid that the two officials will be ratifying an existing agreement between Israel and the US on how to deal with Iran. The agreement was reportedly reached in December last year and seeks joint coordination to counter Iran's missile program and its proxy network across the Middle East. Sources said the two national security advisers will make changes to the agreement that reflect the "new reality" of the US no longer being party to the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran. Earlier this month, the US formally withdrew from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal , which lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for limits on its nuclear program. President Donald Trump said the deal had "serious flaws" and would not prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Sources added that Bolton and Ben-Shabat will also discuss joint military cooperation in countering Iran's presence in Syria. The move comes as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu prepares to discuss Iran with several European leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron, and UK Prime Minister Theresa May, next week . The three countries remain parties to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, and are scrambling to save the deal's framework .

"","Joint statement by M. Emmanuel Macron, President of the Republic, Ms Theresa May, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and Ms Angela Merkel, Chancellor of Germany [ 1 ] It is with regret and concern that we, the leaders of France, Germany and the United Kingdom, take note of President Trump’s decision to withdraw the United States of America from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. Together, we emphasize our continuing commitment to the JCPOA. This agreement remains important for our shared security. We recall that the JCPOA was unanimously endorsed by the UN Security Council in Resolution 2231. This resolution remains the binding international legal framework for the resolution of the dispute about the Iranian nuclear programme. We urge all sides to remain committed to its full implementation and to act in a spirit of responsibility. According to the IAEA, Iran continues to abide by the restrictions set out by the JCPOA, in line with its obligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The world is a safer place as a result. Therefore we, the E3, will remain parties to the JCPOA. Our governments remain committed to ensuring the agreement is upheld, and will work with all the remaining parties to the deal to ensure this remains the case, including through ensuring the continuing economic benefits to the Iranian people that are linked to the agreement. We urge the US to ensure that the structures of the JCPOA can remain intact, and to avoid taking action which obstructs its full implementation by all other parties to the deal. After engaging with the US Administration in a thorough manner over the past months, we call on the US to do everything possible to preserve the gains for nuclear non-proliferation brought about by the JCPOA, by allowing for a continued enforcement of its main elements. We encourage Iran to show restraint in response to the decision by the US; Iran must continue to meet its own obligations under the deal, cooperating fully and in a timely manner with IAEA inspection requirements. The IAEA must be able to continue to carry out its long-term verification and monitoring programme without restriction or hindrance. In turn, Iran should continue to receive the sanctions relief it is entitled to whilst it remains in compliance with the terms of the deal. There must be no doubt: Iran’s nuclear programme must always remain peaceful and civilian. While taking the JCPOA as a base, we also agree that other major issues of concern need to be addressed. A long-term framework for Iran’s nuclear programme after some of the provisions of the JCPOA expire, after 2025, will have to be defined. Because our commitment to the security of our allies and partners in the region is unwavering, we must also address in a meaningful way shared concerns about Iran’s ballistic missile programme and its destabilizing regional activities, especially in Syria, Iraq and Yemen. We have already started constructive and mutually beneficial discussions on these issues, and the E3 is committed to continuing them with key partners and concerned states across the region. We and our foreign ministers will reach out to all parties to the JCPOA to seek a positive way forward.

"Warsaw ‘Iran’ summit: What lies beneath","Piotr Buras & Ellie Geranmayeh  & Jeremy Shapiro  @EllieGeranmayeh & @JyShapiro  24th January, 2019  ECFR experts share their insight into the manouevres around next month’s US-Poland summit. What does it mean for the JPCOA, and what steps should European countries take in response? This month, US secretary of state Mike Pompeo announced that the United States and Poland would jointly host a summit that will include “an important element of making sure that Iran is not a destabilising influence” in the Middle East. Due to take place in Warsaw on 12-13 Feburary, the conference is viewed as controversial both in European capitals and Tehran. It could signal a gradual unravelling of European unity on Iran policy. ECFR’s experts consider how the summit is viewed from the perspective of the US, Poland, and Iran, and recommend next steps for other European countries.  Jeremy Shapiro What if they held a conference on Iran’s malign influence in the Middle East and nobody came? Well, in the case of the February summit, we may soon find out. Mike Pompeo announced that Poland would host this event during a January eight-country trip to the Middle East. The United States and Poland intend to invite some 70 countries, though pointedly not Iran itself. The purpose of the conference is probably to keep US anti-Iranian activity in the news and sustain the narrative that the US and Pompeo are “doing something”. The foreign ministers of Russia and France, and the European Union high representative, have already said they will not go. The United Kingdom, Germany, and China may well follow suit.  It is not clear what a ‘coalition of the willing’ that includes none of the parties to the Iran nuclear deal besides the United States can really hope to accomplish. A joint communiqué describing Iranian malign influence signed by some Sunni Arab states and a bunch of US allies with no connection to the Middle East is unlikely to further isolate Iran. The moment the idea fell from Pompeo’s lips, speculation ran rampant that the US sought to ‘divide the EU’ over Iran. But as so often in the Trump administration, observers are mistaking the pseudo-random emanations of a confused policy process for some sort of purposeful strategy. Dividing the EU on Iran would not really be that hard, but first the US would have to take the Europeans seriously and design a policy to exploit the seams between the EU countries with influence over Iran, particularly the UK, France, Germany, and Italy. The Trump administration’s blunderbuss approach to Iran policy, by contrast, seems designed to ensure European unity. It is at best indifferent to whether the EU is united or not. Getting Poland, a country with no stake in Iran, to host a conference is quite simply not up to the high standard for dividing the EU set by the Bush administration in the lead-up to the 2003 Iraq war. More probably, the purpose of the conference is simply to keep US anti-Iranian activity in the news and sustain the narrative that the US and Pompeo are “doing something” about the malign influence of Iran. It is consistent with a US policy towards Iran that to date has been much more focused on inputs than outputs. The US wants to keep up the pressure on Iran, but has never really described how it expects to translate that pressure into better behaviour from Iran. Is the US seeking regime change, the wholesale destruction of the Iranian economy, or perhaps to provoke Iranian escalation as a prelude to war? It is not at all clear, even apparently to the administration itself. It is hard to divide the EU if you cannot explain to its members what precisely they should be divided about. At the moment, the EU is united in its belief that, beyond reflexive hostility, the US has no effective strategy toward Iran. A pointless conference in Poland will not change that.  Ellie Geranmayeh It is no surprise that Warsaw’s decision to partner up with the Trump administration in hosting the summit went down poorly in Tehran. Iran’s foreign minister Javad Zarif was quick to tweet a reminder of the time when Iran took in over 100,000 Polish refugees, noting “Polish Govt can't wash the shame: while Iran saved Poles in WWII, it now hosts desperate anti-Iran circus.” Other Iranian officials have described the summit as a “game” being played by Iran’s enemies, and warned that Poland’s miscalculation will be met with a “serious and uncompromising response”. But news of the summit was not a great surprise to Tehran: rumours have circulated for months that the United States planned to hold such a conference. Some speculated that the event is targeted to overshadow the 40 th anniversary of the Islamic revolution the same week. Tehran views the summit an another attempt by the US to isolate the country, and divide European countries over their Iran policy. Iran knows that the Trump administration has exerted considerable effort to persuade European capitals into the “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran, an outcome Tehran is keen to avoid. Iran is angered by Poland’s move, which comes against a backdrop of increasing tensions between EU countries and Iran on an array of issues. There are mixed feelings inside Iran as to whether the US will be successful in its attempt to split EU countries. Regardless of this success, Iran is angered by Poland’s move, which comes against a backdrop of increasing tensions between EU countries and Iran on an array of issues. This has led to a growing sense in Tehran that Europe and the US are teaming up to play ‘good cop-bad cop’ roles aiming to pressure Iran on critical security issues, most notably its missile programme. Indeed there is a widespread sense across political factions inside Iran that Europeans cannot deliver any meaningful economic benefits to Iran on the nuclear deal and will sooner or later be dragged into line with US policy on Iran more generally. In response to the announced summit, Iran has so far summoned Poland’s top envoy in Tehran and cancelled a Polish film festival due to be held later this month. Some have speculated that Iran may tighten visa requirement for Polish tourists and others have argued that Iran should destroy graves commemorating Polish soldiers and refugees from the second world war. It is unclear, beyond this, how Tehran can or will retaliate to create a cost for those countries attending the conference. In an attempt to contain the fallout, a Polish delegation led by deputy foreign minister Maciej Lang visited Tehran this week. The diplomatic outreach has eased some tensions with Tehran although the Iranian authorities say they are unconvinced by Poland’s explanations for hosting the event and excluding Iran. Iran is likely to assess its full retaliation based on what actually comes out of the Warsaw summit and, importantly, the level of European representation at the meeting. Last September, the US administration made a similar attempt to isolate Iran at the United Nations General Assembly by initiating a special Security Council session focused on Iran’s nuclear programme. This backfired: after pressure from European governments (which were keen to avoid a showdown with Washington on the nuclear deal) the US was forced to broaden the agenda to cover wider non-proliferation issues and was faced with firm support by the international community for the nuclear deal. Indeed, the Trump administration has already backtracked from Pompeo’s original framework for this summit, shifting from an anti-Iran discussion to a broader Middle East security. However, the fact that Iran has been excluded from the meeting, and that the US Iran Action Group is reportedly in charge of coordinating the summit, signals that the agenda will have a heavy Iran focus. If the summit ultimately fails it may serve Tehran’s interest not to over-react and instead point to this as another failed attempt by Washington to turn the world against Iran.  Poland is not an obvious choice as the location for the Middle East conference, to say the least. The country’s political and economic stakes in Iran are not high, and its record of engagement in the region is rather moderate. Warsaw is the capital of a central European EU and NATO member state, not a neutral place like Geneva, Helsinki, or Vienna where difficult multilateral negotiations usually take place. The assumption that Poland’s interest in holding the controversial meeting lies primarily in its bid for a special partnership with the US is thus not far-fetched. Polish government representatives have encouraged this reading of the situation by emphasising the symbolic role of the event for Poland’s rising position in the world and strategic cooperation with Washington. In March 2019, US decisions about further enhancement of American military presence in Poland (“Fort Trump”) are expected – a goal  which enjoys absolute priority in current Polish security and foreign policy. This is not the right moment to oppose American demands, especially for a government known for its sympathies with Donald Trump and tense relations with EU partners. But should the conference go beyond these national strategic considerations after all? Warsaw has not given up on its support for the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), and has thus not broken the European Union’s consensus – that was the message conveyed by Poland’s foreign minister Jacek Czaputowicz at the Foreign Affairs Council last Monday. Poland believes that, while the EU should try to rescue the agreement, doing so at any cost would be counterproductive, for several reasons. First, risking a major conflict with the US over Iran would be a mistake. This is why plans for a special purpose vehicle to circumvent possible US sanctions are viewed as adding insult to injury. The countries of central and eastern Europe distrust the way the E3 and Federica Mogherini handle the Iran file, believing that they do not take into account the views of all EU member states while acting on EU’s behalf. Second, Poland supports the US view that Iran’s destabilising role in the Middle East needs to be addressed in parallel with the nuclear talks. Some diplomats in Warsaw argue that, rather than kill the JCPOA, the forthcoming conference can, in fact, help it survive. They maintain that it is wrong to dub the event an ‘anti-Iran conference’. The summit is supposed to address a number of regional issues, including terrorism, Yemen, and weapons proliferation. Some progress on these matters could ‘balance’ the JPCOA and make the further observance of the JCPOA a more plausible choice for the US However, the Polish authorities are instrumental in toning down expectations. Czaputowicz said in a recent interview that he does not expect any formal decisions or declarations from the event, apart from concluding statements by Mike Pompeo and himself as co-hosts of the event. He does not consider criticism of Poland’s decision to be legitimate. At a public event organised by ECFR in Warsaw on 22 January, Poland’s deputy foreign minister, Bartosz Cichocki, said: “[the criticism of Trump] is that he acts unilaterally, not multilaterally. So we host a conference, inviting several dozens of countries to multilaterally discuss one of the most important global problems – peace and stability in the Middle East – but then we hear, ‘No, this conference is not OK’.”  The Warsaw summit has left many European capitals feeling extremely uncomfortable. The E3 in particular want to avoid a new public showdown with Washington over the nuclear agreement. While they broadly agree that Iranian regional behaviour should change, they disagree with the confrontational US approach, fearing that it will feed further destabilising regional instability. There is also concern that the US is directly seeking to drive a wedge between Europeans on the Iran nuclear issue by holding the summit in Poland and circumventing both the E3 and the European Union, which have been in close contact with the US over the past year on Iran. Ultimately, the best-case scenario for Europe would be for the US administration to pull the plug on the summit because of low turnout. A number of European ministers have already declined attendance, citing pre-existing commitments. There are also signs that the US sees a need to reconfigure the summit, moving beyond a focus on confronting Iran, to avoid embarrassment by securing broader attendance. Failing that, European governments should take steps that preserve European unity and avoid undermining Europe’s efforts to preserve the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). While working to address Iran’s regional positioning, they should seek to ensure this does not feed a polarising zero-sum approach.

"Netanyahu Provides Stunning New Evidence That Iranians Planned Sacking Of Babylon In 539 B.C.","TEL AVIV, ISRAEL—Presenting the documents as proof that Iran entered the Joint Comprehensive Plan nuclear agreement in bad faith, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday provided what he is calling “stunning new evidence” that Iranians planned the 539 B.C. sacking of Babylon. “This trove of recently uncovered top-secret information proves Iran is a dangerous nation that withheld key details concerning their sixth-century B.C. conquest of Mesopotamia during nuclear program negotiations,” said Netanyahu, who claimed Mossad agents infiltrated Iranian facilities to capture thousands of pages of charts, maps, and official correspondence detailing the nation’s clandestine efforts to overthrow the Ptolemaic Dynasty and subjugate the Cappadocians. “The Iran nuclear deal’s framework is premised on misleading information—not only did Iran fail to mention attacking Babylon, but we also have proof that Xerxes I planned to cross the Hellespont in 481 B.C. to land 50 war elephants at Byzantium. Israeli intelligence has also obtained proof that thousands of spears and chariots were stockpiled for a surprise excursion into Parthia. As a result, we have no choice but to tear up the nuclear deal.” Netanyahu also claimed to have uncovered secret Iranian plans for the 1979 kidnapping of 52 American citizens.","https://www.theonion.com/netanyahu-provides-stunning-new-evidence-that-iranians-1825694150"
"Europeans scramble to save Iran nuclear deal but face new concerns over U.S. sanctions","PARIS — European leaders opened a diplomatic push Wednesday to salvage the Iran nuclear accord without the United States, starting direct talks with Tehran and considering how to maintain business ties in the face of Washington opposition. “The deal is not dead,” said French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, speaking on France’s RTL radio. “There’s an American withdrawal from the deal, but the deal is still there.” French President Emmanuel Macron — Europe’s leading interlocutor as it sought to persuade Trump not to abandon the deal — spoke with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani by phone Wednesday. “The French president emphasized the willingness of France to continue enforcing the Iran nuclear agreement in all respects,” said a statement from the Elysee Palace. “He underlined the importance that Iran do the same.” Those sentiments were shared in other capitals backing the 2015 accord: Brussels, London, Berlin, Moscow and Beijing. Rouhani has ordered his diplomats to engage with their European counterparts. However, he and other moderates who support the accord, and diplomacy more generally, are under pressure from staunch conservatives who have long opposed it. “I don’t trust these three EU countries either,” Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , tweeted in English. “If the govt. wants to make a contract, they should ask for a guarantee, or else they will all do just as the U.S. did.” When President Trump announced on Tuesday that the United States would be withdrawing from the deal — a signature achievement of President Barack Obama’s administration that placed limits on Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for lifting international sanctions — he complained that its sunset provisions did nothing to stop Iran from seeking nuclear weapons in the future. “The agreement was so poorly negotiated that even if Iran fully complies, the regime can still be on the verge of a nuclear breakout in just a short period of time,” he said. Administration officials who filled in the gaps of Trump’s announcement made clear that the United States plans a full return to pre-deal sanctions, with the potential for new measures, and that there is no plan to issue waivers or allow allies or favored companies to circumvent their full effect. That means European companies and others that have moved into Iran since the deal took effect will have to choose between shutting down operations there or continuing to do business in defiance of the United States — and risk their access to the much larger U.S. market. Among the firms that would be affected is Airbus , a European aviation consortium, which in 2016 won a $19 billion contract to provide 100 planes to national carrier Iran Air. It has delivered three planes so far. (U.S. aviation firm Boeing also won contracts worth about $20 billion.) “We’re carefully analyzing the announcement and will be evaluating next steps consistent with our internal policies and in full compliance with sanctions and export control regulations,” a spokesman for Airbus said in a statement. French oil giant Total is another major beneficiary of the Iran deal’s lifting of sanctions, securing a $2 billion agreement to develop the South Pars oil field, shared between Iran and Qatar. “Today, for Total, is a historic day, the day we come back to Iran,” Patrick Pouyanné, Total’s chief executive, said at a signing ceremony in Tehran in July. Now that agreement is in doubt. Pressures on European companies “are actually intended consequences,” according to a senior State Department official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity under department ground rules. With virtually no existing U.S. economic relationship with Iran, the official said, “secondary sanctions,” primarily affecting Europe and Asia, are among the best ways to squeeze Iran’s economy. The United States used secondary sanctions to isolate Iran before the nuclear agreement, the official said. “That’s what we want to do again. It’s not about sanctioning foreign companies; it’s about using the leverage and engaging the way we did before.” “The sanctions worked last time,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Fox News, and brought Iran to the bargaining table. The goal now is to partner with allies to push Iran to negotiate a new agreement that will cover nuclear activities as well as ballistic missiles and destabilizing Iranian activity in Syria, Yemen and beyond. The administration took Macron’s Tuesday tweet saying he was prepared to “work together on a broader framework,” covering all of Iran’s bad behavior, as evidence “that France is eager to be part of an effort” to pressure Iran, the State Department official said. However, after the new U.S. ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell , tweeted that “German companies doing business in Iran should wind down operations immediately,” Bruno Le Maire, France’s finance minister, fired back that the United States should not consider itself the world’s “economic policeman.” In a statement, the E.U. said that “sanctions lifting has a positive impact on trade and economic relations with Iran. The E.U. stresses its commitment to ensuring that this can continue to be delivered.” Eric Schweitzer, head of the Association of German Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said it is “incomprehensible that the activities of German companies should still suffer” while the E.U. remains committed to the accord. About 120 German companies operate in Iran with their own staff, and 10,000 German companies do business with Iran, according to the German-Iranian Chamber of Industry and Commerce. As explained by the State and Treasury departments, U.S. measures will be implemented in several phases. All new contracts with Iran are immediately banned. All existing contracts must be terminated within 90 days, with the exception of energy-related relationships and contracts, which are being given a 180-day “wind-down” period. “We wanted to be careful on the energy markets, that we had an orderly transition away from Iranian oil,” Mnuchin said. Oil prices rose more than 3 percent Wednesday, hitting the highest levels in more than three years. The administration will also redesignate all Iranian individuals and entities who were specifically sanctioned by the U.S. government before the nuclear agreement went into effect — a total of at least 600. In Europe, the U.S. withdrawal from the accord has been seen as a significant blow to transatlantic relations — more devastating than Trump’s decisions to take the United States out of the Paris climate accords, formally recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and threaten unilateral sanctions on aluminum and steel. No other issue saw European leaders go to such lengths to change Trump’s mind over such a lengthy period of time, and none ended in greater humiliation. There are some measures that European leaders can take to try to protect European enterprise in Iran. “Europeans need to at least debate threatening to impose costs on U.S. action,” said Ellie Geranmayeh, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. She suggested that E.U. leaders could respond to secondary sanctions by targeting American companies in Europe. The question, Geranmayeh said, is “the extent to which the Europeans are going to allow their own companies to be hamstrung by U.S. foreign policy.” But European companies will likely respond to an ultimatum from Washington, political analysts said. Given the size of the U.S. market and the power of U.S. banks, European companies would have comparatively little leverage. “The E.U. can take steps to mitigate the impact of the sanctions,” said Luigi Scazzieri of the London-based Center for European Reform. “But overall, companies will be scared. They will also prioritize their business with the U.S.” DeYoung reported from Washington. Luisa Beck in Berlin, Quentin Ariès in Brussels, Karla Adam in London and Brian Murphy in Washington contributed to this report.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/europeans-scramble-to-save-iran-nuclear-deal-but-face-new-concerns-over-us-sanctions/2018/05/09/39937066-536f-11e8-abd8-265bd07a9859_story.html"
"The Real Achievement of the Iran Nuclear Deal","Right now, a thousand pundits and politicians are debating the details of Thursday’s framework nuclear deal with Iran. That’s fine. I think the details are far, far better than the alternative—which was a collapse of the diplomatic process, a collapse of international sanctions as Russia and China went back to business as usual with Tehran, and a collapse of the world’s ability to send inspectors into Iran. But ultimately, the details aren’t what matters. What matters is the potential end of America’s 36-year-long cold war with Iran. For the United States, ending that cold war could bring three enormous benefits. First, it could reduce American dependence on Saudi Arabia. Before the fall of the shah in 1979, the United States had good relations with both Tehran and Riyadh, which meant America wasn’t overly reliant on either. Since the Islamic Revolution, however, Saudi Arabia has been America’s primary oil-producing ally in the Persian Gulf. After 9/11, when 19 hijackers—15 of them Saudis—destroyed the Twin Towers, many Americans realized the perils of so great a dependence on a country that was exporting so much pathology. One of the unstated goals of the Iraq War was to give the United States a large, stable, oil-producing ally as a hedge against the uncertain future of the House of Saud. What George W. Bush failed to achieve militarily, Barack Obama may now be achieving diplomatically. In recent weeks, American hawks have cited Saudi anxiety about a potential Iran deal as reason to be wary of one. But a big part of the reason the Saudis are worried is because they know that as U.S.-Iranian relations improve, their influence over the United States will diminish. That doesn’t mean the U.S.-Saudi alliance will disintegrate. Even if it frays somewhat, the United States still needs Saudi oil and Saudi Arabia still needs American protection. But the United States may soon have a better relationship with both Tehran and Riyadh than either has with the other, which was exactly what Richard Nixon orchestrated in the three-way dynamic between Washington, Moscow, and Beijing in the 1970s. And today, as then, that increases America’s leverage over both countries. Over the long term, Iran may also prove a more reliable U.S. ally than Saudi Arabia. Iranians are better educated and more pro-American than their neighbors across the Persian Gulf, and unlike Saudi Arabia, Iran has some history of democracy. One of the biggest problems with America’s Mideast policy in recent years has been that, from Saudi Arabia to Pakistan to Egypt, the governments the United States supports preside over populations that hate the U.S. Thursday’s nuclear deal, by contrast, may pave the way for a positive relationship with the Iranian state that is actually undergirded by a positive relationship with the Iranian people. Which brings us to the second benefit of ending America’s cold war with Iran: It could empower the Iranian people vis-à-vis their repressive state. American hawks, addled by the mythology they have created around Ronald Reagan, seem to think that the more hostile America’s relationship with Iran’s regime becomes, the better the United States can promote Iranian democracy. But the truth is closer to the reverse. The best thing Reagan ever did for the people of Eastern Europe and the U.S.S.R. was to embrace Mikhail Gorbachev. In 1987, American hawks bitterly attacked Reagan for signing the INF agreement , the most sweeping arms-reduction treaty of the Cold War. But the tougher it became for Soviet hardliners to portray the United States as menacing, the tougher it became for them to justify their repression at home. And the easier it became for Gorbachev to pursue the policies of glasnost and perestroika that ultimately led to the liberation of Eastern Europe and the disintegration of the U.S.S.R. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, like Gorbachev, wants to end his country’s cold war with the United States because it is destroying his country’s economy. And like Gorbachev, he is battling elites who depend on that cold war for their political power and economic privilege. As Columbia University Iran expert Gary Sick recently noted , Iran’s hardline Revolutionary Guards “thrive on hostile relations with the U.S., and benefit hugely from sanctions, which allow them to control smuggling.” But “if the sanctions are lifted, foreign companies come back in, [and] the natural entrepreneurialism of Iranians is unleashed.” Thus “if you want regime change in Iran, meaning changing the way the regime operates, this kind of agreement is the best way to achieve that goal.” The best evidence of Sick’s thesis is the euphoric way ordinary Iranians have reacted to Thursday’s agreement. They’re not cheering because they want Iran to have 6,000 centrifuges instead of 20,000. They’re cheering because they know that opening Iran to the world empowers them, both economically and politically, at their oppressors’ expense. Finally, ending the cold war with Iran may make it easier to end the civil wars plaguing the Middle East. Cold wars are rarely “cold” in the sense that no one gets killed. They are usually proxy wars in which powerful countries get local clients to do the killing for them. America’s cold war with the U.S.S.R. ravaged countries like Angola and El Salvador. And today, America’s cold war with Iran is ravaging Syria and Yemen. When America’s relationship with the Soviet Union thawed, civil wars across the world petered out because local combatants found their superpower patrons unwilling to send arms and write checks. The dynamic in the Middle East is different because today’s cold war isn’t only between Iran and the United States, it’s also between Iran and Sunni Arab powers like Saudi Arabia and Egypt, neither of which seems particularly interested in winding down the civil wars in Syria and Yemen. Still, a different relationship between the United States and Iran offers a glimmer of hope. In Syria, for instance, one reason Iran has staunchly backed Bashar al-Assad is because it fears the fierce hostility of his successors. The United States cannot entirely alleviate that fear, since some of the groups battling Assad—ISIS, most obviously—are fiercely hostile to Iran and to Shiites in general. But if Iran’s leaders knew that at least the United States would try to ensure that a post-Assad government maintained good relations with Tehran, they might be somewhat more open to negotiating a transfer of power in Syria. Clearly, the United States should push for the best nuclear deal with Iran that it possibly can. But it’s now obvious, almost three decades after Reagan signed the INF deal with Gorbachev, that it’s not the technical details that mattered. What mattered was the end of a cold war that had cemented Soviet tyranny and ravaged large chunks of the world. Barack Obama has now begun the process of ending America’s smaller, but still terrible, cold war with Iran. In so doing, he has improved America’s strategic position, brightened the prospects for Iranian freedom and Middle Eastern peace, and brought himself closer to being the kind of transformational, Reaganesque president he always hoped to be.

"Lessons Of A Collapsed North Korean Nuclear Deal","David Welna  Nearly a quarter-century ago, the U.S. signed an agreement aimed at stalling North Korea's drive for nuclear weapons. That deal collapsed eight years later. SCOTT SIMON, HOST: President Trump announced, of course, that June 12 summit with North Korea's back on and also blamed his predecessors. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: This should've been handled many years ago not only by President Obama but by other presidents. SIMON: The U.S. did strike a nuclear deal with North Korea under President Clinton. It held together for nearly eight years, then collapsed. And North Korea exploded its first nuclear bomb. NPR's David Welna revisits the deal known as the Agreed Framework. DAVID WELNA, BYLINE: In the early 1990s, North Korea appeared hellbent on going nuclear. It rejected proposed international inspections, announced it was pulling out of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and said it intended to produce weapons-grade plutonium. Then former President Jimmy Carter intervened. He went to Pyongyang, brandishing an olive branch. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JIMMY CARTER: The time has come to establish full friendship and understanding. WELNA: That helped lure North Korea, also known as the DPRK, into negotiations. In late 1994, a deal was struck that shut down its plutonium-producing reactor. The top U.S. negotiator was Robert Gallucci. He hailed the so-called Agreed Framework, at the time, as a breakthrough. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ROBERT GALLUCCI: Hundreds of nuclear weapons' worth of material would have been produced by these reactors. These reactors will be frozen now. WELNA: In return for shutting down those graphite reactors, the U.S. promised to supply North Korea with heavy fuel oil and two light water reactors. Joel Wit was the State Department's coordinator for implementing the deal. JOEL WIT: There were provisions to establish diplomatic relations. There were provisions to lift economic sanctions. There were provisions for security assurances. And so for them, all of that was a good deal. WELNA: But in 2002, a different administration did not see the deal good for the U.S. President George W. Bush declared North Korea part of an axis of evil. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GEORGE W. BUSH: North Korea has a regime arming with missiles and weapons of mass destruction while starving its citizens. WELNA: Later that year, the U.S. accused North Korea of secretly pursuing another path to nuclear weapons not through the prohibited plutonium process but by enriching uranium. Donald Rumsfeld, at the time, was defense secretary. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD RUMSFELD: It is a fact. It is a reality that they stand in direct breach of, I guess, four separate agreements. WELNA: The official then in charge of arms control at the State Department was John Bolton, who's now President Trump's national security adviser. Bolton would later write that North Korea's uranium enrichment was, quote, "the hammer I had been looking for to shatter the Agreed Framework." Nicholas Eberstadt, of the American Enterprise Institute, says he and Bolton often discussed that deal. NICHOLAS EBERSTADT: John Bolton's assessment was that the North Korean side was untrustworthy and was negotiating in bad faith. And I'd say that the record, since then, amply bears out misgiving. WELNA: Freed from inspections, North Korea tested its first nuclear weapon in 2006. Last month, a North Korean official declared, in her words, a feeling of repugnance towards John Bolton. But Joel Wit, who is now with the Stimson Center, says, in private, it was a different story. WIT: The North Koreans, who have a good sense of humor and wanted to sort of twist the knife a little bit into the Americans, would thank John Bolton for helping them build a nuclear weapons stockpile. WELNA: The lesson from all this, says Stanford University nuclear weapons expert Siegfried Hecker, is... SIEGFRIED HECKER: If you're going to pull out of a deal, you'd better be prepared for the consequences. WELNA: A lesson he also applies to the recent U.S. exit from the nuclear deal with Iran.

"Experts doubt North Korea really destroyed nuclear test site","Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.  News  By Mary Kay Linge  Submit     June 2, 2018 | 8:05pm Experts are increasingly doubtful that North Korea has destroyed its underground nuclear testing site . The weak explosions on May 24 at entrances to the Punggye-ri test site deep beneath Mount Mantap did not trigger the internal collapses that would put the site out of commission, a U.S. official told CNN , based on seismic data. No geology experts or arms inspectors – just a small delegation of foreign journalists – were allowed to monitor the showy detonations. North Korea removed technical equipment from the tunnel complex before they blew up the entrances, U.S. officials have also confirmed. Kim Jong Un proclaimed the destruction of Punggye-ri as a goodwill gesture ahead of his on-again, off-again summit meeting with President Trump.

"Here's What You Need To Know About What Trump Just Did To The Iran Nuclear Deal","U.S. President Donald Trump has, after months of threatening to do so, signed a memorandum instructing the U.S. government to begin pulling out of the controversial deal over Iran's nuclear programs. His administration has outlined a number of steps it plans to take in the next six months, but it is still not entirely clear when certain provisions will end and what impacts that may have in the near- and long-term with regards to Iran or other international engagements, such as America's ongoing negotiations with North Korea . Trump made the announcement from the White House on May 8, 2018. As a presidential candidate, president-elect, and then president, he has continually railed against the deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA , pledging to either negotiate a new one, or, failing to do that, withdraw from the agreement entirely. The biggest issue, as we at The War Zone have noted before , is that the JCPOA focuses on Iran's nuclear activities to the exclusion of everything else. Iran is, by the U.S. government's own admission, abiding by the letter of the deal. At the same time, however, the United States, as well as Israel, accuse Iranian authorities of violating the spirit of the agreement by not using relief from international sanctions and other tangible benefits to pursue stabilizing policies in the Middle East and elsewhere. Trump outlined this basic argument in his remarks on May 8, 2018: "In theory, the so-called 'Iran deal' was supposed to protect the  United States and our allies from the lunacy of an Iranian nuclear bomb, a weapon that will only endanger the survival of the Iranian regime.  In fact, the deal allowed Iran to continue enriching uranium and, over time, reach the brink of a nuclear breakout. The deal lifted crippling economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for very weak limits on the regime’s nuclear activity, and no limits at all on its other malign behavior, including its sinister activities in Syria, Yemen, and other places all around the world." Many have argued that the JCPOA is therefore inherently unworkable and that the U.S. government should discard it, which the Trump Administration has now chosen to do. At the same time, many criticisms of the deal are based on either honest or deliberate misunderstandings of its mechanisms, which appears to have informed Trump's final decision at least to some degree. So, here's a quick overview of what Trump said and did not say: Regardless, this is what his administration now plans to do: It is without a doubt worth considering whether Iran should be penalized for continuing the various aforementioned malign activities. It's also worth asking whether or not the Iran Deal, which was serving its stated purpose, was worth getting rid of entirely in pursuit of that goal. "The fact is they are going to want to make a new and lasting deal, one that benefits all of Iran and the Iranian people," Trump declared in his remarks, which you can watch in full below. "When they do, I am ready, willing, and able." However, the Iran deal is a multi-national affair and the other parties, Iran, Russia, China, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany have already made it clear they intend to continue within the JCPOA framework for the foreseeable future. The trilateral statement from the U.K., French, and German governments perhaps represent the greatest immediate challenge for the United States, given that Trump pointedly threatened anyone who continued to deal with Iran with additional sanctions. Russia and China have both reiterated their support for the deal, as well. The Israeli government, especially Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is a long time critic of the deal, has openly embraced Trump's decision. Iran already appears willing to try and use the Trump Administration's decision to drive a wedge between it and some of its oldest allies, saying that it will continue to work with the remaining parties to continue with the JCPOA. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani did say he was ordering the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran to begin preparations for restarting enrichment and processing work if the deal completely collapses. "This is a psychological war, we won’t allow Trump to win... I’m happy that the pesky being has left the Barjam," Rouhani said in his own statement after Trump's announcement, using the Farsi acronym for the JCPOA. "Tonight we witnessed a new historic experience... for 40 years we’ve said and repeated that Iran always abides by its commitments, and the US never complies, our 40-year history shows us Americans have been aggressive towards great people of Iran and our region." Trump's decision also comes literally right before newly appointed U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was set to meet with North Korean representatives in that country to iron out the final details about a historic meeting between the American president and premier Kim Jong Un at a still undisclosed location. A central goal of those discussions will be the elimination of North Korea's nuclear arsenal and ballistic missiles, which will already be a tall order . The United States has also been looking to immediately secure the release of three Americans that North Korea is holding hostage. It's not clear how the Trump Administration's decision vis-a-vis Iran might impact the geopolitical situation in the Middle East or elsewhere more broadly, but we might not have to wait long to see the second- and third-order effects.

President Donald Trump’s unilateral decision to withdraw from the multilateral agreement to restrain Iran’s nuclear program will inevitably have far-reaching consequences, including the further destabilisation of the Middle East. More immediately, it risks fracturing a Western alliance that has provided the cornerstone of global security since the end of the second world war. In a joint statement , the leaders of France, Germany and Britain raised the possibility of the US being in breach of a United Nations Security Council resolution endorsing the deal. The resolution remained the “binding international legal framework for the resolution of the dispute,” Emmanuel Macron, Angela Merkel and Theresa May said.   Read more: Why Trump's decertification of the Iran nuclear deal may prove a costly mistake    As such, France, Germany and Britain said they would still adhere to the agreement. The other participants – Russia and China – would also be unlikely to abandon the deal. And Iran itself, in a measured reaction to the Trump announcement, said it, too, would stick with the agreement . This means the Trump administration risks finding itself further isolated from the international community, following his decision to also pull out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Paris Climate Change accords. It is hard to exaggerate the many negative outcomes that may well flow from the decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal, including an escalation of tensions between Iran and US clients in the Middle East. In fact, heightened tensions across the Middle East and an intensification of a regional arms race would seem to be almost inevitable. Following through on his threats during his 2016 presidential election campaign to tear up the Iran deal, Trump could hardly have been more explicit in his rejection of a foreign policy centrepiece of his predecessor’s tenure in his announcement on Tuesday. The fact is, this was a horrible, one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made. It didn’t bring calm, it didn’t bring peace, and it never will. What this announcement confirms – if confirmation is even necessary – is that the US leader has unshackled himself from the moderating influences of advisers who have been shoved out of his national security team in recent weeks. These include Harold McMaster, his former national security adviser, and former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who had both argued strenuously against a withdrawal from the Iran deal. Trump is now in the hands of what is one of the more bellicose teams of advisers assembled by an American president in recent memory. Where this leaves James Mattis, Trump’s defence secretary is unclear. Mattis has called the verification element of the Iran deal “robust” and has been opposed to actions that would undermine an existing treaty.   Read more: Donald Trump backs out of Iran nuclear deal: now what?    Understandably, former President Barack Obama and his secretary of state, John Kerry, have expressed dismay over an unravelling of an agreement that took years to negotiate with the aim of forestalling Iran’s acquisition of a nuclear weapons. In a rare rebuke of Trump, Obama said the decision would make the world less safe. He described it as a “losing choice between a nuclear-armed Iran or another war in the Middle East.” Understandably - as one of the architects of the agreement - Kerry also expressed his dismay . “Instead of building on unprecedented nonproliferation verification measures, this decision risks throwing them away and dragging the world back to the brink we faced a few years ago,” he said. In addition to tearing up the deal, Trump announced a re-imposition – and strengthening – of sanctions against Iran. These will be phased in over 90-day and 180-day periods. What is not clear is what impact these sanctions will have on international companies doing business in Iran. Under a previous sanctions regime, companies risked being shut out of the US economy if they invested in – or traded with – Iran. An interpretation of just what is implied for international business will be an early test of America’s ability to make the sanctions stick. This is sure to get messy. Already, US companies such as Boeing, which had negotiated US$20 billion in aircraft sales to Iran, are finding such business is now in jeopardy. Further complicating the picture is Trump’s proposed face-to-face meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un to put an end to Pyongyang’s nuclear program. Kim may well ask himself what value might be placed on negotiations with Trump. Under these circumstances, neither side would be likely to invest much trust in one another.

"Trump administration gives Russia an ultimatum on Cold War-era arms treaty","BRUSSELS — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Tuesday that the United States would no longer adhere to a Cold War-era arms control agreement if Russia does not come into compliance with the accord within 60 days. The ultimatum, issued during a meeting at NATO headquarters in Brussels, amounted to a softening of the U.S. position after President Trump abruptly announced in ­October that he had decided to “terminate the agreement.” Neither Pompeo nor other NATO officials held out much hope that Russia would destroy the missiles and launchers that the alliance said violate the landmark accord. But European leaders had sought a delay to pressure the Kremlin one last time. “It makes no sense for the United States to remain in a treaty that constrains our ability to respond to Russia’s violations,” Pompeo said after a meeting of NATO foreign ministers. “We hope that they’ll change course, but there’s been absolutely no indication that they’ll do so.” The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, signed by the United States and the Soviet Union in 1987, banned nuclear and nonnuclear missiles with ranges of 500 to 5,500 kilometers, or about 310 to 3,400 miles. It has been a pillar of Europe’s security architecture for more than three decades, but the Trump administration has said it puts the United States at a military disadvantage against China, which is not bound by the treaty. For much of the West, the INF Treaty was a watershed moment in Cold War arms control, eliminating more than 2,600 missiles and ending a years-long standoff with nuclear missiles in Europe between East and West. Trump’s announcement that the United States would exit the treaty raised fears of a return to Cold War tensions when nuclear-tipped missiles across the continent threatened to strike targets within minutes. Pompeo did not detail U.S. plans, but he suggested the Pentagon would quickly start to build its capability. Under the terms of the treaty, either party can give a six-month notice before withdrawing. “There is no reason the United States should continue to cede this crucial military advantage to revisionist powers like China,” Pompeo said Tuesday. European leaders have sought to preserve the arms control framework, even as NATO foreign ministers declared Tuesday that they believed Russia was in violation. “I regret that we now most likely will see the end of the INF Treaty,” said NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, who has spoken of how the Cold War arms buildup shaped his views of security as he grew up in Norway. “We really felt that the world was moving forward when the Soviet Union and the United States in 1987 agreed.” The termination plan was set to go into effect Tuesday, but German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other European leaders persuaded Trump to delay the move to allow for additional consultations, according to diplomats and officials familiar with the discussions. Merkel’s last-ditch effort, which she advanced in a meeting with Trump in Buenos Aires on Saturday, came up against a determined drive by the president’s national security adviser, John Bolton, to withdraw from the accord. U.S. officials braced for an immediate withdrawal last week after Bolton signed and distributed a memo conveying the president’s decision. A copy of the memo, obtained by The Washington Post, underscored a directive for the secretary of state to “make all necessary arrangements” to implement the withdrawal “no later than December 4, 2018.” The defense secretary was also ordered to “develop and deploy ground-launched missiles at the earliest possible date,” the memo said. But the Trump administration tabled the action after Merkel and other European officials told Trump that the rapid withdrawal schedule did not give them enough time to explain the policy change to domestic audiences. “Merkel had a very good meeting with Trump and managed to convince the president to give more time before a pull out,” said one European diplomat who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss diplomatic conversations. The decision to delay the withdrawal marked a rare victory for Merkel, whose frosty relationship with Trump has been marred by disappointment and frustration. But although Trump’s gesture showed some amount of deference to the German leader, it was simply delaying the inevitable, diplomats and experts said. “Is this delay going to satisfy the allies? No, because nothing has changed except delaying the outcome, and the Europeans want a different outcome,” said Daryl Kimball, executive director for the Arms Control Association. Some NATO foreign ministers expressed skepticism that the treaty held value if Russia was violating it. “If you have a treaty, you must comply with it,” said Lithuanian Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicius. Russia is “not complying,” he said, “so what’s the value of the treaty?” European leaders fear that their voters could be sympathetic to a Kremlin argument that the United States is tearing up one international agreement after another, after Trump’s decision to leave the Paris climate agreement and the Iran nuclear deal. Their frustration may have been fueled by Pompeo’s decision to deliver a blistering foreign policy address in Brussels just before the NATO meeting, using a city that serves as a capital for the European Union to lash out at multinational organizations and “bureaucrats.” Trump critics “claim America is acting unilaterally instead of multilaterally, as if every kind of multilateral action is by definition desirable,” Pompeo said. “Our mission is to reassert our sovereignty, reform the liberal international order, and we want our friends to help us and to exert their sovereignty as well,” he said to stony silence from the European audience as he excoriated a long list of multilateral organizations. European officials and Democrats in Congress have complained that the Trump administration’s decision to withdraw was done without due consultation and squandered an opportunity to focus the world’s attention on Russia’s alleged violations of the treaty, which center on its covert development of an intermediate-range, ground-launched cruise missile designated 9M729. The Kremlin says it continues to adhere to the treaty. “The administration’s sudden decision to withdraw unilaterally is a political and geostrategic gift to Russia,” the top-ranking Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations, Armed Services and Intelligence committees said in a letter to Trump on Monday. “It takes the focus away from Russia's transgressions and malign behavior and instead feeds a narrative that the United States is willing to shred our commitments unilaterally without any strategic alternative.” U.S. diplomats say they do not expect Russia will ever return to compliance with the treaty, in part because they think the Kremlin has decided it needs the missile technology to protect itself against China, with which it shares a border. Garrett Marquis, the spokesman for the White House National Security Council, said European leaders should hardly be surprised by the Trump move. “The U.S. has engaged in extensive consultation with our allies on Russia’s violation of the INF Treaty, which has been ongoing for more than five years,” Marquis said in an emailed statment. He also cast the decision to withdrawal as a fait accompli instead of a move still under discussion. “On October 20th, the President made clear the U.S. will terminate the Treaty,” he said.

"","This picture released from North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) on April 16, 2017 shows North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un arriving for a military parade in Pyongyang, April 15, 2017. (STR/AFP/Getty Images) WASHINGTON ( JTA ) – The Trump administration last week endorsed a narrative long promoted by critics of the Iran nuclear deal: It’s North Korea all over again. “An unchecked Iran has the potential to travel the same path as North Korea, and take the world along with it,” Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Thursday at a press availability. He was explaining why President Donald Trump had ordered a review of the Iran nuclear deal reached by his predecessor, Barack Obama. “The United States is keen to avoid a second piece of evidence that strategic patience is a failed approach,” Tillerson said. “Strategic patience” is a rubbery term that critics have applied loosely to presidents – Republican and Democratic – who do not strike back swiftly at evidence of nascent rogue weapons-of-mass-destruction programs, instead preferring diplomatic and economic pressure. It has been applied to North Korea and the policy first instituted by the Clinton administration in 1994, when it signed the Agreed Framework with that country, but also to how President George W. Bush attempted to renegotiate a North Korea deal in the mid-2000s, and to the chemical weapons removal pact Obama negotiated with Russia and Syria in 2013. The North Korea framework collapsed in the early 2000s, during the Bush administration, and in 2006, North Korea tested a nuclear device. Syria’s apparent use of sarin gas in an attack earlier this month that killed 89 civilians in rebel-held territory suggested that the 2013 removal of chemical weapons was not fully implemented. Tillerson’s implication: Without a thorough review of the nuclear deal, Iran could also one day surprise the world with a nuclear test. Is he right? It’s obviously too soon to say. But here are some ways the Iran deal is similar to its failed North Korea predecessor – and ways it is different.  Sanctions relief In both the North Korea and Iran cases, some sanctions relief was up front – critics say that was a recipe for failure. With North Korea, the United States agreed to deliver 500,000 tons of oil to the cash-starved nation. (There were other goodies, but these were attached to progress in the dismantling of its nuclear capacity.) In the Iran deal, the U.S. agreed to unfreeze American-based Iranian assets held since the 1978 revolution, amounting to $400 million, and to lift secondary sanctions targeting businesses in other countries that deal with Iran. (Bans on U.S. business with Iran mostly remain in place.) It’s not clear yet what benefit Iran accrues from the lifting of the secondary sanctions – estimates vary wildly between $40 billion and $150 billion. In addition, non-nuclear sanctions – relating to Iran’s backing for terrorism and its human rights abuses – remain in place. “Tillerson is reflecting concerns that the Iran deal has many of the same inherent flaws as the Agreed Framework and may end up in the same scenario,” said Mark Dubowitz, the executive director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, the preeminent think tank opposing the Iran deal. Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association, which backed the Iran deal, said that unlike in the North Korea deal, the Iran agreement has “snap-back” provisions that allow the United States to reimpose the sanctions should Iran ever be in violation. Critics of the Iran deal counter that while the United States may snap back the sanctions, many other nations that were part of the alliance that imposed international sanctions on Iran in 2011 would not. Deal defenders say the prospect of the United States reimposing sanctions on Iran, even if it does so alone, is enough to keep Iran from breaking the agreement. The North Korea deal required the dismantling of three nuclear reactors, one completed and two under construction. The Iran pact requires 24/7 access to known enrichment facilities and allows inspectors to demand access – albeit with a waiting period of 24 days – at any other facility they suspect of nuclear weapons activity. Tillerson on the day he announced the review of the deal also affirmed that Iran was in compliance. The North Korea agreement referred only in vague terms to inspections beyond the three facilities and did not explicitly count out weapons-enriched uranium, although its ban was certainly implied in the endgame — a nuclear-free Korean peninsula. (The reactors that were shut down enriched plutonium.) The North Koreans fiercely resisted inspections beyond the three facilities. The difficulty is not in detecting whether a nation is violating the agreement – intelligence agencies and satellite surveillance have been proficient at tracking down violations. It was North Korea’s attempt to secretly enrich uranium in the early 2000s that precipitated the collapse of the deal, and the Obama administration exposed the existence of a secret uranium enrichment plant in Fordow, Iran, in 2009 based on intelligence reports. Instead, problems could occur in attempts to inspect sites where inspectors do not have easy access. Dubowitz said the provision allowing inspectors to demand access to suspected sites may be unenforceable: Hard-liners in the Iranian leadership have said repeatedly that access to military sites would be a no-go. “It’s the covert sites that are the big problem,” he said. “If you’re not getting into the military sites, the deal is deeply flawed.” Heather Hurlburt, the director of New Models of Policy Change at New America, a think tank that backed the Iran deal, said the inspections regime is much more intrusive in the Iranian case. “It’s like comparing the security check at a Manhattan office tower with the security check at Ben Gurion,” she said, referencing the Israeli airport known for its stringent measures. Iran is a diverse nation with an ancient tradition of multilateral ties with its neighbors. North Korea is a secretive Stalinist regime and has just one significant relationship – with China. Kimball said the world powers that negotiated the Iran deal granted Iran considerable leverage: Iran does not have the self-contained system that allows Kim Jong-un, North Korea’s leader, to retain power even as his people starve. In order to survive, he suggested, the regime must allow Iranians to trade and thrive. “The Iranians highly, highly value the removal of nuclear sanctions and access to oil markets,” Kimball said. “There was no similar incentive for North Koreans.” Iranians “deeply fear” losing access to the outside world, he said. “As time goes on they will be more accustomed to this liberal environment of trade and investment,” Kimball said, “and that will make it more appealing to them to continue to comply.” Dubowitz said it was Iran’s ambitions in the region that made it more dangerous, adding that Kim was unlikely to strike unless he felt his regime was threatened. The Iranians, Dubowitz argued, could one day use nuclear leverage to support their expansionist claims in the Middle East, including in Syria, where they are backing the Assad regime in quelling the rebellion, in Yemen, in the Persian Gulf – and against Israel. “North Korea is an isolationist pariah nation with a Stalinist ideology that appeals to no one,” he said. “Iran sees itself as guardian of the Islamic world.” The goal of the Framework Agreement was a “nuclear-free Korean peninsula” – no nukes, period. North Korea was to be allowed to get light-water reactors, which are proliferation resistant. Iran, beginning eight years after the 2015 agreement, will be allowed in increments to reactivate centrifuges that could conceivably enrich uranium to weapons grade. That has been a key concern of critics of the Iran deal, known officially as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. “The JCPOA fails to achieve the objective of a non-nuclear Iran,” Tillerson said in his press availability. “It only delays their goal of becoming a nuclear state.” Secretary of State Rex Tillerson speaking about Iran and North Korea at the State Department in Washington, D.C., April 19, 2017. (Mark Wilson/Getty Images) Kimball sounded exasperated at what has become a common misperception. “The deal obliges Iran to never pursue nuclear weapons in the future,” he said. While it is true that the agreement allows Iran to enhance its enrichment capabilities over time, and decreases the breadth of the inspections regime, Iran remains a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. As part of the deal, it signed on again to the “additional protocol” that allows International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors expanded access to sites in perpetuity. (Iran had previously shucked off the additional protocol.) The protocol has no sunset clauses.  Why can’t we be friends? It wasn’t just bad actions by North Korea that killed the deal – it was bad faith and distrust on all sides. President Bill Clinton signed the deal in 1994, but by the time of implementation, an adversarial Republican Congress was in place and frustrated the deliveries of promised heating oil. In both the North Korea and the Iran cases, missile development has been an obstructing factor. Neither deal touched ballistic missiles, but testing the devices, capable of delivering a nuclear weapon, has exacerbated tensions. The United States in the late 1990s began to sanction North Korea for its ballistic missile tests, but North Korea defiantly kept testing them and said the sanctions were eroding the framework agreement. A similar scenario is playing out now. The Obama administration last year and the Trump administration this year issued new sanctions following Iranian missile tests; Iran has said it sees the sanctions as undermining the agreement. Trump made clear he sees the missile tests as the problem, saying this week of Iran that “they are not living up to the spirit of the agreement.” I accept the JTA Privacy Policy .

"The Nuclear Deal Makes America Complicit in Iranian Crimes","Why would the U.S. want to fund the regime’s imperialism? Editor's Note: This article is part of a debate about whether to stay in the Iran deal. Read the other entries here . The fundamental question when discussing a nuclear deal with Tehran is this: Are you prepared to fight over it? If not, then any deal is a good deal. This willingness to go to the mat also affects whether you are prepared to push back against the clerical regime in the Middle East, especially in Syria and Iraq, and even whether and how you are willing to advance a regime-change policy—regime change, incidentally, being what an increasingly big and vocal slice of the Iranian people want. Westerners should appreciate the religio-political evolution of the Islamic Republic. The rebellion against an Islamist clerisy ought to ring our inner chimes and make us realize that the Western and Islamic worlds share a lot of intellectual property, that they are, as V.S. Naipaul astutely noted after traversing the Middle East and landing at Bombay, two branches of the same family. But the debate over the deal illuminates much about the debate over differing approaches to the Islamic Republic. In a recent Atlantic article , Phil Gordon sums up the things I wouldn’t concede to the regime as if those demands were unreasonable: Absolutely, I would never concede advanced centrifuges, long-range ballistic missiles, inspections that never touch Revolutionary Guard bases—where we know the regime once worked on nuclear triggers—and nuclear-weapons research files and personnel that are all off limits to International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors. Just the concession of the last two means in practice that one can never know whether the regime is cheating outside of surveilled sites. This ought to be a critical issue for anyone who cares about the deal’s substance, and not just about punting a problem down the road. Obama conceded an industrial-scale nuclear-weapons industry and all we got in return is a bit of time. Once Iranian engineers perfect high-velocity centrifuges, which will take Ali Akbar Salehi, the atomic “energy” chief, and his merry men no more than a decade, it’s game, set, match. Unless a miracle happens, the Central Intelligence Agency will have no means to detect bomb-grade enrichment at small cascades the mullahs could disperse throughout the country. When we have a deal that Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, Revolutionary Guard Corps Commander Mohammad Ali Jafari, the Quds Force and expeditionary militia overlord Qassem Soleimani, and Salehi all approve of, we have a deal that everyone should run from. Obama did not. I strongly suspect because he had already conceded the bomb. And without a willingness to risk direct confrontation with the regime, regional pushback against Tehran will always just be rhetoric—the type of pro forma comments you heard regularly from Hillary Clinton’s foreign-policy people, or now at Brookings in well-intentioned strategy sessions. If Washington retains the nuclear agreement, even economic pushback against the regime for its barbarism in Syria is an illusion, since any serious coercion runs smack into the guiding principle of the JCPOA: sanctions relief in exchange for temporary nuclear restraint. To punish seriously the mullahs for mass murder in Syria—and the Iranians have been essentially running the savage ground game since the late Revolutionary Guard General Hosein Hamedani took over the Syrian  militia system in 2013—sanctions would need to be big, too big probably for the confines of Obama’s deal. (The Iranians really want to keep the deal because of all its strategic goodies, so they might be willing to endure significant sanctions pain before they call it quits.) In the eyes of the Europeans and most Washington Democrats, acceptable sanctions against Iran for its crimes in the Levant will always be just south of where they might jeopardize the JCPOA. That sad fact may even be why the Trump administration’s sanctions against the Islamic Republic have so far been—with the possible exception of its designation of the entire Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization—pretty lame. The Trump White House’s sanctions—barring the Rev Guard designation—could have been approved by Obama. To put it another way, the JCPOA helped strategically and ethically to enfeeble former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, and former National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster. Former ambassador Frederic Hof, who oversaw Syria policy at the State Department after 2012, claims that concern about the nuclear diplomacy and outreach to the Islamic Republic just morally annihilated the Obama administration’s approach to Syria. I’m willing to accept the contention that Obama would have done nothing in Syria regardless of his outreach to Khamenei because he was deadly serious about downsizing America in the region. The all-critical inflection point for Mr. Obama’s red-line Syria fiasco in 2013 may not have been his dreams of engaging Khamenei but the fear of a Middle Eastern slippery slope. The two aspirations are not, of course, mutually exclusive. Gordon himself wasn’t content with the position that Obama took on Syria. All to his credit, I guess, though I have to ask how he could have squared doing anything serious in Syria and maintaining the JCPOA. They seem mutually exclusive to me. It makes no sense—unless one is scared of war with the clerical regime beyond all else—for the United States to allow the regime more money for its imperialism. Surely among the most embarrassing moments for the Obama administration was when Ben Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser, and Central Intelligence Agency director John Brennan suggested that monies gained through the nuclear agreement would largely go to domestic spending—as if the Islamic Republic were a Western welfare state. The JCPOA has effectively made America a handmaiden to the clerical regime’s adventurism. We will soon see what President Trump will do if he walks away from the atomic accord and whether that act will oblige him to deal more forcefully with Iranian imperialism. His allergy to America in the Muslim Middle East is strong, perhaps as strong as Obama’s. On that depressing note, let me turn to regime change, where things look better. To be clear: I don’t view regime change as an answer to the mullahs’ quest for the bomb. I would support regime change even if the ruling clerical elite and the Revolutionary Guards weren’t gunning for nuclear weapons. And I would not base any U.S. strategy on an atomic timeline. Regime change ought to be the ultimate goal of American foreign policy toward the Islamic Republic for the simple reason that only when the Islamist dictatorship collapses will Iranian malevolence against the United States cease. I do think it’s highly unlikely that, if the theocracy falls, the succeeding Iranian government will develop nuclear-tipped missiles. If the next government is democratic, which is likely given the evolution of Iran’s polity, it certainly won’t, since the clerical regime’s hegemonic ambitions have limited traction in Iranian society, and domestic demands, as we have witnessed in the risings in 2009 and the end of last year, will take precedence. I don’t know if the Islamic Republic is “on its last legs.” Yet the regime experienced a near-death experience during the Green Revolution protests in 2009-2010. The profound regime depression provoked by the provincial demonstrations, which started last December, continues. (This has undoubtedly been helped by Mr. Trump, who scares the regime, and has helped to send the riyal through the basement floor. More credit goes, of course, to the Islamic Republic’s fundamental dysfunction, especially in economics. ) There are many reasons to believe that the theocracy is in serious trouble. When George Kennan wrote his famous article on “The Sources of Soviet Conduct,” he didn’t think the U.S.S.R. was near collapse. The potential imminence of such a collapse is not why we should want it in Iran. We should want it because we recognize the regime’s implacable, virulent hatred of the United States, and its religious-fascist roots that give birth to awful conspiracies and vicious imperialism. One of the most disconcerting things about the Obama administration’s approach toward Iran was how it so misread, miscast, or usually just ignored what the Iranian regime was saying . Iranian president Hassan Rouhani is many things, but a “moderate,” as Western media tends to describe him, is not one of them. Khamenei is way, way beyond “complicated,” to use Mr. Obama’s description. If the Roman God Mendacious came down to earth, he would be Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif. Doing what we can—and yes, we undoubtedly will make stupid mistakes in this effort—to get rid of this regime would be a blessing to us and the region. It’s always good to remember what Bob Kagan remarked about waging foreign policy: Like in baseball, if you bat just a bit north of .300, you’ll probably make it into the Hall of Fame. Concerning past parallels that concern Gordon, I don’t believe that Ronald Reagan single-handedly brought down the Soviet Union. Far from it. The inhumanity—the unsustainable, impoverishing, soul-erasing, fun-obliterating contradictions of communism—brought down the Soviet Union. Reagan’s willingness to build up American defenses and push back, and to state clearly what folks like Henry Kissinger and Jimmy Carter seemed unable to say—that the Soviet Union was an evil empire ready for the dustbin—gave a timely shove. Without Reagan, the U.S.S.R. might have lasted far longer. And Reagan certainly didn’t allow arms-control treaties to stand in the way of the larger mission. Neither should we. We can ratchet up a lot of economic pain for the Iranian regime. Rouhani made a lot of promises before he was elected president, promises that he could not keep. Broken promises and lost hope can provoke internal unrest. Before anything else, the United States has to get the rhetoric right.  President Trump’s statements about tyranny and human rights in Iran have been better than President Obama’s (they could hardly be worse). But there is certainly lots of room for Washington to echo and amplify the cause of those fighting against religious dictatorship. We know from the dissidents behind the Iron Curtain that such rhetorical support kept men and women spiritually, sometimes physically, alive. We should never treat Iranians as if they are somehow different than non-Muslims. I don’t support arming Iranian minorities, even the ones who’ve been cruelly oppressed by the regime. But I certainly do think America can do more to publicize their plight and punish the mullahs economically, diplomatically, and legally for their ghastly behavior. And there is, of course, a place for the CIA. Not a big one. I have been involved in Iranian covert action and read voluminous files about the agency’s covert activities elsewhere: I have no delusions about what can and cannot be done. But Langley could do, I am sure, a lot more to fracture the fraternity of the Revolutionary Guards and bring dissident entertainment to the masses. People like Obama and former Secretary of State John Kerry want to believe that greater commerce with Iran, plus patience, will set us free. That’s the approach they would probably still like with North Korea—bribery as diplomacy, and the illusion that money will soothe the totalitarian beast. But North Korea has nukes, they have thousands of artillery tubes that can level Seoul, and the U.S. has only the option of nuclear retaliation against them to prevent things from getting really awful. The only question that remains is why anyone would want to walk down the same path with the Islamic Republic. The Agreed Framework of 1994 is the JCPOA. I am always amused by how men of the left, whenever the possibility of military confrontation looms, find comfort in the supposedly transformative promise of capitalism. This is a particularly Western—Christian—way of looking at the mainspring of the soul. One would think given the fertile history of capitalism cross-breeding with fascism that American liberals would be more judicious in such hopes. In Iran there is no paralyzing tension between a Revolutionary Guard commander or mullah making millions while plotting the deaths of thousands in Syria, installing in Lebanon ever-better conventional missiles aimed at Tel Aviv, or building nuclear triggers at Parchin. It’s the hardest task but the first commandment in foreign affairs—one that has bedeviled both Democratic and Republican administrations in dealing with the Islamic Republic: Don’t mirror image. We need to take Iranian revolutionaries seriously. They have principles and pride. They have integrity and a cause.  The United States and the clerical regime haven’t had problems, as President Obama sometimes suggested, because we’d failed to reach out and because we misapprehended each other. We haven’t had problems because they seized our diplomats, or because we supported (however lamely) a coup against Mohammad Mosaddeq in 1953.  Look into the archives of the State Department and the CIA and you will see that Washington regularly tried to engage, even before Bill Clinton started apologizing for the British Empire. We remain at odds because we are enemies, because they choose to be our enemy.  For cause: Americans’ most basic beliefs, let alone all the desiderata of modern Western culture, are carcinogenic to them. If Obama and his diplomats had gone into nuclear negotiations with the clerical regime with that understanding guiding them, the JCPOA as it is surely would not exist.

"India-Iran Rice-For-Oil Deal Not Modi Magic, It’s a UPA-Era Scheme","“ Starting 4 November 2018, India will send rice to Iran in the exchange of crude oil. With this modern form of the old fashioned barter system, our dependence on the American dollar will be less and our Indian rupee will get a new life. Modi magic transforming India! ” This message has been posted by Priti Gandhi, who describes herself on Twitter as ‘National In-charge of Social Media- BJP Mahila Morcha’. Gandhi has a significant following of over 3,21,000 and is followed on the platform by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The fake news website Postcard  News published an article extolling this ‘masterstroke’ by PM Modi. It was also tweeted by Mahesh Vikram Hegde, founder of the website. The claim that this is a unique initiative by the Modi government to circumvent currency-related restrictions on trade has also been shared by several individual users on Facebook. From 4 November, US sanctions on the Iranian oil sector will come into effect, obstructing payment avenues to the oil-rich nation. Relations between the US and Iran have been on a downward spiral ever since US President Donald Trump reimposed economic sanctions on Iran after his country withdrew from the nuclear deal framework agreement reached in 2015. With the Indian government reportedly mulling rupee-based trade with Iran, sympathisers of the ruling party are on an overdrive to project this move as ‘Modi magic’. An alternate payment system was devised by Iran and India in the wake of previous sanctions on the West Asian nation. In an ingenious workaround, Iran had agreed to accept payment for oil exports in rupees. The Indian currency earned by Iran could be redeemed to import goods and commodities from India including rice, textiles, tea, coffee and pharmaceutical products. It is worthwhile to note here that the rice-for-oil trade between the two countries is not barter in the literal sense. The rupee-based trading system devised for commercial exchange with Iran is not an initiative of the Modi government. In fact, it was first introduced in 2012 when Iran had borne the brunt of economic sanctions imposed by the Western nations over its nuclear programme. News reports by Times of India , The Hindu and  Live Mint had referred to the payment mechanism that had been threshed out by the two countries. In a report of February 2012, Live Mint had quoted the then Iranian ambassador to India who had stated that 45 percent of the payment will be in Indian currency, which would be utilised by Iran to pay for imports from India. In March 2013, a report by Reuters had highlighted how Iran’s oil revenue was helping Indian rice exporters regain their business which had suffered due to imposition of sanctions. The mechanism was in place till 2015, when payment for Iranian oil was guaranteed in rupees. With the lifting of sanctions in 2015, the two nations had reverted to the traditional mode of exchange. The Islamic Republic of Iran’s nuclear enrichment programme pursued vigorously in the first decade of the new millenium had culminated in a concerted effort led by the US and EU, seeking to cripple Iran with economic sanctions in view of the deadlock that had emerged in negotiations. Iran was accused of clandestinely enriching uranium for military use, a charge Iran vehemently denies, stating that its programme is purely for civilian purposes. The nation’s banking sector was targeted in 2012 – Iran had been locked out of SWIFT – the global transaction network which allowed cross-border transactions with foreign banks. The impasse was broken with the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action , a framework nuclear agreement between Iran, the five permanent members of the UNSC, Germany and the European Union (EU) which lifted restrictions on export of Iranian oil and Iranian funds frozen abroad. This year, the US reneged on the the framework nuclear agreement and reimposed sanctions. This has once again resulted in an arrangement between India and Iran that will guarantee Iranian oil for Indian currency. According to reports, the Indian government is considering a similar arrangement with Russia and Venezuela. The claim by Priti Gandhi, Postcard News and numerous social media users is not true, as India had adopted this mechanism from 2012 to 2015.

"Fact-checking President Trump’s claims about the North Korea deal","Analysis  Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events  Here’s a roundup of claims made by President Trump at a news conference on June 12 and in an interview with George Stephanopoulos of ABC News about his talks in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. North Korea has a long history of making agreements and then not living up to its obligations. The document signed by Trump and Kim was not “very comprehensive” but remarkably vague, leaving it open to interpretation and debate, compared to previous documents signed by North Korea . The statement said North Korea (officially the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, or DPRK) committed to “work towards the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.” The phrase is not defined and “toward” is rather weak. In the past, North Korea viewed “ denuclearization ” to mean the United States removing the nuclear umbrella it provides to Japan and South Korea; there is no indication its definition has changed. Contrast the Trump-Kim statement, for instance, with the Sept. 19, 2005, agreement signed by North Korea, the United States and four regional neighbors, which was much more specific: “The DPRK committed to abandoning all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs and returning, at an early date, to the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to IAEA safeguards. The United States affirmed that it has no nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula and has no intention to attack or invade the DPRK with nuclear or conventional weapons.” Similarly, the Feb. 19, 1992, declaration by North and South Korea was also very detailed. Trump’s national security adviser, former U.N. ambassador John Bolton, was critical in the past of what he considered vague agreements. In his memoir, “ Surrender is not an Option ,” Bolton faulted a follow-on statement to the 2005 agreement, issued Feb. 13, 2007, as “radically incomplete,” even though it included a detailed road map for the “eventual abandonment” of the Yongbyon nuclear facility. He noted that it did not deal with North Korea’s existing stockpile of nuclear weapons, contained “no verification provisions whatsoever” and failed to address the issue of Japanese and South Korean abductees. None of those elements are in the statement Trump signed with such fanfare. Trump apparently offered this unilateral concession to North Korea without consulting with the Pentagon or the government of South Korea . It’s unclear what the annual war games cost. Trump offered no figures for his claiming of saving “a tremendous amount of money.” South Korea pays about 50 percent of the total non-personnel costs of U.S. troop presence on the peninsula, according to the Congressional Research Service . Given that this is a training exercise, troops still need training, so presumably canceling this particular exercise will not reduce such expenses. Oddly referring to the Clinton “regime,” Trump suggests that the United States gave North Korea billions of dollars under the 1994 Agreed Framework negotiated under then-President Bill Clinton, which was an earlier attempt to scrap North Korea’s nuclear weapons programs. Not so. The U.S. contribution was an annual supply of 500,000 tons of heavy fuel oil every year to make up for the theoretical loss of its Yongyon nuclear reactor while new “light-water” ones were built by an international consortium. Between 1995 and 2003, the United States spent about $400 million supplying the fuel oil that was required under the deal. The consortium was called the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO). KEDO’s final annual report , issued in 2006, shows that 30 or so countries funding the project spent about $2.5 billion before it was shut down after the George W. Bush administration accused North Korea of cheating on the Agreed Framework. (Most of the funds, about $2 billion, were contributed by South Korea and Japan alone.) But this money did not go to North Korea; it went to the companies that were building the reactors in South Korea, Japan and the European Union. As for “nothing happened,” that’s incorrect. Until the Bush administration accused North Korea of cheating on the 1994 accord by pursuing uranium enrichment, Pyongyang’s stash of plutonium in spent fuel rods was kept in cooling ponds under the constant supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency. When the deal collapsed, North Korea broke the seals, removed the rods and began building nuclear weapons. Trump has repeatedly said this in recent weeks, but there is little evidence to suggest that Iran’s meddling in regional politics has ceased since he pulled out of the nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers. A presidential-level meeting with a rogue regime is generally reserved for the end of a process. With a summit at the front end, Trump conferred legitimacy and status on a leader regarded as one of the world’s worst tyrants. Trump may believe that is unimportant, but most foreign policy experts view it as a significant concession. President Barack Obama did not pay any money to get detainees back from North Korea or, depending on how you look at it, Iran. Trump’s reference to $1.8 billion refers to the timing of a settlement of a long-standing claim regarding undelivered aircraft made by Iran on the same day four American detainees, including The Washington Post’s Jason Rezaian, were released. A jumbo jet carrying $400 million in euros, Swiss francs and other currencies landed in Tehran as the detainees flew off. That money purportedly was partial payment of an outstanding claim by Iran for U.S. military equipment that was never delivered. Soon after, $1.3 billion in cash followed. State Department officials have insisted that the negotiations over the claims and detainees were not connected but came together at the same time, with the cash payment used as “leverage” to ensure the release of detainees. This is false. Our fact-check on this Four-Pinocchio Trump claim appeared on The Washington Post website during Trump’s news conference. The reality: The United States has a surplus, not a $100 billion trade deficit, with Canada. Nope, nope, nope. Trump never gets this correct. There are two types of funding for NATO: direct funding and indirect funding . Direct funding, for military-related operations, maintenance and headquarters activity, is based on gross national income — the total domestic and foreign output claimed by residents of a country — and adjusted regularly. With the largest economy in NATO, the United States pays the largest share — about 22 percent. Germany is second, with about 15 percent. A significant portion of the U.S. share is operating the Airborne Early Warning and Control System (AWACS) fleet, according to the Congressional Research Service . The U.S. share of the actual military budget is negotiated each year, but largely based on the cost-sharing formula, and amounts to less than $500 million a year, according to Defense Department documents . That’s chump change in a $700 billion military budget. As for indirect funding, since 2006, each NATO member has had a guideline of spending at least 2 percent of gross domestic product on defense spending. At a 2014 summit, responding to Russian aggression in Ukraine, NATO members pledged to meet that guideline by 2024. As of 2017, 12 of the 28 members exceed the guideline — with the United States leading the way at 3.6 percent. But this is simply money that each country would spend on its own military — or on missions that do not include NATO, such as peacekeeping in Africa. A team of Stanford University experts, led by Siegfried S. Hecker, came up with a 10- to 15-year estimate when they produced a detailed road map for dismantlement of the North Korean program. Hecker has visited North Korean nuclear facilities, including one for enriching uranium, four times. “The approach suggested here is based on our belief that North Korea will not give up its weapons and its weapons program until its security can be assured,” the report said. “Such assurance cannot be achieved simply by an American promise or an agreement on paper, it will require a substantial period of coexistence and interdependence.” The report noted that “North Korea has covert facilities that it is unlikely to declare and eliminate initially” and that “the financial costs of each of the steps must be analyzed and anticipated.” Trump’s suggestion that just a 20 percent pullback is irreversible does not make much sense, especially if North Korea has hidden facilities that are not declared. Trump rejected any comparison with Obama’s Iran deal. But he’s wrong to claim, yet again, that Obama paid Iran $150 billion. Trump always makes it sound like this is U.S. taxpayer money — and he always uses a too-high estimate. Because of international sanctions over its nuclear program, Iran had billions of dollars in assets that were frozen in foreign banks around the globe. With sanctions lifted, in theory those funds would be unlocked. But the Treasury Department estimated that once Iran fulfills other obligations, it would have about $55 billion left. (Much of the other money was obligated to illiquid projects in China.) For its part, the Central Bank of Iran said the number was actually $32 billion, not $55 billion. Trump has done a 180-degree turn here. On Nov. 7, 2017, speaking in South Korea , here’s how the president described life in North Korea: “The horror of life in North Korea is so complete that citizens pay bribes to government officials to have themselves exported abroad as slaves. They would rather be slaves than live in North Korea. … Citizens spy on fellow citizens, their homes are subject to search at any time, and their every action is subject to surveillance. In place of a vibrant society, the people of North Korea are bombarded by state propaganda practically every waking hour of the day. North Korea is a country ruled as a cult. At the center of this military cult is a deranged belief in the leader’s destiny to rule as parent protector over a conquered Korean Peninsula and an enslaved Korean people.” The United Nations, in a 2014 report detailing “systematic, widespread and gross human rights violations,” described the country as a ruthless police state where as many as 120,000 people are kept in political gulags under horrific conditions; other prisons, effectively labor camps, hold people for ordinary crimes. Telephone calls are monitored, and citizens are punished for watching or listening to foreign broadcasts. “Throughout the history of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, among the most striking features of the State has been its claim to an absolute monopoly over information and total control of organized social life,” the report said. “The commission finds that there is an almost complete denial of the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, as well as of the rights to freedom of opinion, expression, information and association. The State operates an all-encompassing indoctrination machine that takes root from childhood to propagate an official personality cult and to manufacture absolute obedience to the Supreme Leader.” In other words, people lacking sufficient fervor for Kim probably will find themselves in prison.

"Follow B&B","asdasdasdasdasdasdasdasdasdasd The European Union and its member states have been scrambling to to preserve the economic benefits of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) for Iran following President Trump’s withdrawal from the agreement on May 8. In the last month, the European Commission has moved to add Iran to the investment mandate of the European Investment Bank (EIB), the EU’s long-term lending institution (even in the face of significant resistance from EIB’s management). Similarly, the European Commission’s Directorate-General for International Cooperation and Development (DEVCO) has set-aside a pool of funding to support projects in Iran. The European External Action Service is also coordinating discussions around central bank payment channels and the European Commission’s revival of the blocking regulation , which prohibits European compliance with extraterritorial sanctions. As a core party to the JCPOA, the UK government has a strong interest in seeing these European efforts succeed. However, in March of 2019, at the end of the Brexit process, the UK will likely leave the EU, meaning that it will end its participation as stakeholder in European institutions, including EIB, as well as European legal frameworks, such as the blocking regulation. While the Bank of England is exploring the creation of payment channels with the Central Bank of Iran, the UK government has shown little real initiative to match European efforts to sustain economic engagement with Iran. In recent weeks, Iranian authorities have indicated that they believe bilateral efforts will prove the most successful in delivering solutions to protect trade and investment in the face of US secondary sanctions. Countries like France, Germany, Austria, Italy and Sweden have been exploring whether it may be possible to use state investment vehicles and financial institutions to facilitate investments to Iran. The UK has not, pointing to the EIB's expanded mandate. But given that EIB is unlikely to finance projects in Iran, and given that the UK is set to exit the EU anyway, the UK government can no longer lean on European efforts in devising an economic package for Iran. To demonstrate its commitment to the JCPOA, the UK should parallelize its Iran policy with that of EU member states and seek its own mechanisms through which to support access to financing in Iran’s economy—both because of the clear national security implications of maintaining the the nuclear deal, but also to take advantage of economic opportunities in a major emerging market, particularly one in which UK companies can continue to make inroads from a low base of activity. The reimposition of US sanctions means that the UK government cannot reasonably rely on British private sector financiers to engage in project finance in Iran. Just as European governments are exploring state-owned entities through which to provide financing, so will the UK financing entity need to be state owned. Helpfully, such an institution exists. CDC Group is the overseas investment arm of the UK government. The group is a state-owned development bank overseen by the Department for International Development. It currently overseas an investment portfolio of around GBP 5 billion and primarily funds projects in Africa and South Asia, with a strong focus in countries where were formerly part of the British Empire and now part of the Commonwealth. CDC has a wide portfolio of investments in infrastructure, health, manufacturing, food and agriculture, and construction. The investment philosophy is focused on “sectors where growth leads to jobs” and the institutions “decision-making process ranks sectors based on their likelihood of creating jobs.” Investments take the form of both equity and debt financing. On the basis of its focus on emerging markets and its investment philosophy focused on job creation, there is justification for the UK government to extend the investment mandate of CDC Group to include projects in Iran. Such a move would parallel the EU’s attempted move in regards to EIB and the still planned funding via DEVCO, as well as the various efforts at the member-state level. If CDC’s investment mandate is extended to Iran, the challenge will be to ensure that the relevant capital can be deployed in Iran. For this purpose, the UK government should seek to use the UK-regulated branches of Iranian financial institutions. These institutions will be able to maintain correspondent banking relationships with their Iranian parent banks in the face of US sanctions. If the UK government can institute additional due diligence protocols around the transfer of funds via this channel, it should be possible to deploy capital in Iran without the need to rely on the UK’s tier one banks. Importantly, in order to encourage the UK to make such a move, the Iranian government must be prepared to offer a privileged pipeline of investment opportunities to CDC Group, particularly with regard to public-private partnership projects in Iran that would include the participation of UK multinationals or SMEs. For example, CDC Group financing could help support the strong inroads made by UK solar energy developers in the Iranian market. Furthermore, the Iranian government should explore export credit or sovereign guarantee arrangements that would project CDC Group’s investments in order to lower the assessed risk behind a given project in Iran. The Iranian government should actively seek a UK commitment to facilitate development financing in Iran. Politically, such a move would be consistent with the ambitions of “Brexit Britain” as the UK will need to replace its reliance on EU institutions in regards to engaging global growth through proactive investments. As with bilateral relations with other European countries, an expansion in economic engagement could reduce pressure on political relations. The UK will no doubt expect to see progress on its consular cases as part of trust-building and the deepening of ties with Iran. Beyond challenges of structuring, the continued political uncertainty in the UK, including the recent change in foreign minister, will make such plans complicated to execute. But Iran can leverage its relationships with key stakeholders within the Foreign and Commonwealth Office as well as in the House of Parliament and House of Lords in order to seek a structured dialogue on this matter. Whether through CDC Group or another special purpose vehicle, Brexit Britain should be pushed to at least match EU proposals to support trade and investment in Iran, and thereby to safeguard the nuclear deal.

"Europe’s balancing act on the nuclear deal: wooing Trump without losing Iran","Ellie Geranmayeh  @EllieGeranmayeh  02nd May, 2018  European leaders have been assiduous in lobbying Washington on the nuclear deal. But Europe must step up its diplomacy to ensure it does not lose Tehran in the process For much of Iran’s political elite, and its overwhelmingly young population, the nuclear deal is becoming a story of failure. This situation risks impacting on Tehran’s willingness to engage politically and to reach diplomatic compromises with Western powers. Last week European leaders were in Washington for a last push to keep the United States on board ahead of the 12 May deadline for Donald Trump to issue waivers required under the nuclear deal. During his visit, Emmanuel Macron suggested that the US and Europe could work on a “new deal” with Iran – one which preserves but expands on the 2015 accord. But with Iran kept out of the European-US talks, Hassan Rouhani has questioned the legitimacy of proposals now put forward by Macron and Angela Merkel for Iran to negotiate further deals on its nuclear programme and regional issues. In the process of wooing Washington on this bigger and better deal, Europe must ensure it does not end up losing Tehran, whose buy-in will be essential to succeeding in this effort. Despite increasing pressures coming from Trump, Iran has continued to fulfil its part of the deal, as verified by the International Atomic Energy Agency 11 times since the deal was implemented in January 2016. Iran has waited to see what actions Trump would take and carefully assessed the ability and willingness of Europe to safeguard the nuclear deal. In October, Tehran sent out clear signals that it would consider sticking to the deal so long as Europe, China, and Russia could deliver a package that served Iran’s national security interests. But as talks between the US and the EU3 (Germany, France, and the United Kingdom) have stepped up over the last few months, Iranian thinking on European positioning has begun to sour. Officials and experts from Iran, interviewed on condition of anonymity over the past month, outlined a growing perception inside Tehran that Europe is unable and/or unwilling to deliver on the nuclear agreement without the US. Even those who defend the nuclear deal inside the country are finding it difficult to continue to do so, not just because of Trump but also because of European tactics, which one Iranian official described as “appeasement by Europe to reward the violator of the deal and Iran’s expense”. This perception has contributed to considerably hardened Iranian rhetoric in recent weeks around a possible US withdrawal. The secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council (SNSC), which includes the most important decision-makers inside the country, warned that Iran may not only walk away from the nuclear deal, but also withdraw from the Non-Proliferation Treaty . Such public statements from senior figures signal that a rethink may be taking place over Iran’s foreign policy orientation and openness to engaging with the West. Decision-makers in Europe should be alert to the gravity of such political shifts. Iranian officials have repeatedly outlined that Iran will abide by the nuclear deal so long as the US does not violate the agreement. If Europe wants to keep Iran on board with the agreement in the scenario where Trump does not issue the sanctions waivers required, or to even sell a new European-US framework to Iran, it will need to shore up its fast-diminishing political capital with Tehran. While Macron’s hour-long call with Rouhani on Sunday was a good start, greater activity is urgently needed. First, Europeans should seek to alleviate growing Iranian fears that the price of saving the deal will be a wider “pressure package”, one which returns their relations to the pre-2013 policy of isolation and sanctions. While the focus is understandably now on securing ongoing US support for the deal, the EU3 should not neglect the fact that any new framework agreed will require at least some Iranian buy-in to make it workable. In the current political climate in Iran, this is not a given.  As such, the EU3 should, as a unified coalition, work at the highest level with Iran’s foreign ministry to shore up confidence regarding the nuclear deal. In advance of the 12 May deadline, if it looks increasingly likely that Trump will not waive sanctions, the newly appointed German foreign minister should follow up on Macron’s call to Rouhani with a visit to Tehran to meet with their Iranian counterpart and consider contingencies (some measures for which are outlined below). Second, EU member states should delay the prospect of new sanctions targeting Iranian regional behaviour, at least until firmer guarantees are in place regarding Trump’s decision on the nuclear deal. The timing of such sanctions has reportedly been the topic of heated debate among the 28 member states. At a minimum, the countries supporting such measures should step up their public messaging to communicate the reasons and the targeted nature of new sanctions, including a commitment that these are not the start of more far-reaching sanctions that will hurt the wider Iranian economy. This is particularly the case with Iran’s private sector, which constantly meets new hurdles placed in its way when seeking to do business with Europe. Third, European governments should double down on efforts to maintain Iranian compliance to the nuclear deal if Trump fails to renew waivers due on 12 May. Such action by the White House would result in the snap-back of US secondary sanctions and are likely to be viewed in Tehran as significant non-performance of the nuclear deal. Europe will need to coordinate with Russia and China to persuade Iran to continue adhering to its nuclear obligations, at least for a period of time. The exhaustion of the dispute resolution mechanism under the nuclear deal can buy time (estimated to be between 2-3 months) for contingency planning while allowing Iran to save face. In this scenario, European governments will need to convince the US that it will be in their mutual interest to agree on an amicable separation on the nuclear deal. Europeans will need to argue that such a settlement would allow Trump to claim victory with his base for withdrawing US participation in the JCPOA, while avoiding deeper damage to transatlantic relations and possibly maintaining Europe’s quiet compliance on regional issues. This path should also allow the US to reverse its course (Europeans should continue to encourage such a reversal, whatever the 12 May decision). As part of this contingency plan, to keep Iran on board Europeans will need to offer some degree of economic relief. It will be critical to reach a pan-European deal with the Trump administration to limit the extent to which the US secondary sanctions that may snap back are actually enforced by US regulators. This should include a series of exemptions and carve-outs for European companies already involved in strategic areas of trade and investment with Iran, with the priority being to limit the immediate shock to Iranian oil exports. European governments should further make a strong case to the Iranian government and public as to why the nuclear deal can continue to serve Iran’s security and economic interest even without the US. They should emphasise the immediate economic benefits of continued oil exports to Europe and possible longer-term commitments for investments in the country. Sustained political rapprochement between Europe and Iran could also influence Asian countries that closely watch European actions (such as Japan, South Korea, and India) to retain economic ties with Iran. Finally, regardless of the fate of the nuclear deal, Europe should keep the pathway open for regional talks with Iran. Germany, France, the UK, and Italy should establish and formalise a regular high-level regional dialogue with Iran that builds on those held in February in Munich. It is a positive sign that a second round of such talks is reportedly due to be held this month in Rome. Such engagement will become even more important if the US withdraws from the nuclear deal, increasing the risk of regional military escalation that is already surfacing between Israel and Iran in Syria. Europeans should focus these talks on damage limitation and de-escalation in both Yemen and Syria, to help create an Israeli-Iranian and Saudi-Iranian modus vivendi in both conflict theatres (something which the US seems uninterested in). Ultimately, Iran’s willingness to implement any follow-up measures on regional issues will be heavily influenced by the fate of the nuclear deal and how the fallout over Trump’s actions is managed. Europe may well not be capable of salvaging the deal if the US withdraws from or violates it. But Europe must at least attempt to do so and demonstrate its political willingness through actions that serve as a precedent for the international community. To do otherwise is likely to have an immediate and consequential impact on Iranian foreign policy and significantly reduce Europe’s relevance for the Iranian political establishment. For Iran’s youth, as the largest population bloc in the country, this will be an important experience in how far Europe is willing to go in delivering on its promises to defend the nuclear deal, whose collapse would affect the Iranian psyche and domestic political discourse for years to come.

"From Doomsday to Delay: 5 Scenarios Ahead of Trump’s Decision on the Iran Nuclear Deal","From the U.S. president signing another sanctions waiver to Tehran resuming its uranium enrichment, here are five potential outcomes – all the way up to war in the Middle East U.S. President Donald Trump said Monday that he will announce his policy on the nuclear agreement with Iran on Tuesday. Trump has until May 12 to decide whether to sign the 120-day waiver on U.S. sanctions against Iran. On his own, he cannot determine the fate of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA): Officially, the United States is just one of its signatories, alongside Russia, China, Great Britain, Germany and France – and, of course, Iran . The remaining governments, which all continue to support the Iran deal, could theoretically keep it alive. However, not only did the United States play the key role in achieving the deal under then-President Barack Obama, but its economic and military clout make any American move potentially disastrous for the JCPOA’s chances of survival. Trump could take one of a number of courses of action and, depending on how the other signatories act, it could lead to different results. One scenario that is implausible is that after spending the last two years – both on the campaign trail and then as president – lambasting the JCPOA as the “worst deal ever,” Trump will suddenly back down and endorse his predecessor’s foreign policy legacy. Whether he decides to “fix or nix it,” Trump plans to either radically change the Iran deal or do away with it altogether. Here are the five likeliest scenarios: 1. Waiver signed with caveats – Death by a thousand cuts  After all the hue and cry of the last few weeks, Trump signs the waiver again (as he has done every four months since taking office). But he will do so with a host of caveats. Adding to the pressure, this time the waiver may be for a shorter period than 120 days. Trump will say he is still against the JCPOA, but is giving the European leaders who have beseeched him to stick with the deal one last chance to come up with improvements that are not just “cosmetic.” >> What happens if Trump pulls out of the Iran deal? Analysis | Despite Iran's threats, Israeli army pushes aggressive line against Tehran in Syria | Analysis | Israel vs. Iran: Winds of war in Jerusalem – with backing from Washington | Analysis | Yes, Iran lied about its nuclear capabilities. But so did Israel | Opinion >>  This will serve Trump, as it will shift the pressure away from Washington and allow the administration to focus on preparing for the upcoming summit with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong Un. This is unlikely to save the Iran deal, though – just prolong its demise. The proposals that have so far come from Germany and France have included new sanctions on Iran’s long-range missile plan and proposals for new ways to counter Iran’s machinations in the region, but have failed to satisfy the U.S. administration – particularly because the other signatories refuse to change the JCPOA in order to address the “sunset” time-limit issue. Another waiver, another delay will not save the deal if Trump and his newly appointed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Adviser John Bolton are determined to ultimately kill it by a thousand cuts. The lingering uncertainty over the deal’s future is almost as damaging to the faltering Iranian economy as a resumption of sanctions. But if the painful death can be drawn out for even longer, why not? 2. No waiver, no action, more delay  Another way for Trump to increase pressure while shifting the blame elsewhere is to not sign the waiver, but not rush to re-impose sanctions either. The sanctions that target Iran’s central bank, and are mainly aimed at hampering its international oil deals, do not come into effect for another 180 days – effectively giving the administration and the other signatories five more months to search for a compromise. The clock would be ticking and there would be two new deadlines: In another 180 days, but also over a second, wider batch of sanctions that must be decided upon on July 11. At this point, the Europeans will be scrambling in both directions: To try to find a solution that could still make Trump backtrack and sign the waivers, better late than never; and, at the same time, prevent the Iranians from pulling out of the JCPOA. Not that it would be in Iran’s interest to do so, since that would automatically trigger sanctions, but they have repeatedly issued statements that they will not agree to any prevarication from the other signatories. As Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted two weeks ago, it’s “all or nothing.” Except it never really is all or nothing, and playing for time would probably serve the Iranians just as it serves Trump. 3. No waiver, new sanctions, a split between the U.S. and Europe  The die is cast. Trump not only refuses to sign the waiver, but his administration acts to reimpose sanctions with an accelerated timetable. Whatever these sanctions target – nuclear-related sectors or other Iranian activities – Tehran will cry foul and pronounce the JCPOA dead. But it could still leave the door open to a compensation deal from the other signatories. Russia and China will play along, but they were trading with Iran before the JCPOA as well. This scenario could well be the biggest diplomatic dilemma in the European Union’s history. The EU is also a signatory, but EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini – a valiant cheerleader for the Iran deal – will be powerless if the leaders of Britain, France and Germany won’t agree on a joint policy. Theresa May, Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel will each have to make independent decisions on whether to defy the United States and join a new Iran deal without the Americans, or fall in line with the Trump administration. This is a momentous decision for the main Western European nations. Do they act against their own stated policies, or open up an unprecedented rift between Europe and the United States? The stakes are particularly high for “Brexit Britain,” which is on course to leave the EU next year. If France and Germany stick with the JCPOA, despite Trump, Prime Minister May’s government will have to decide which relationship they are more loath to jeopardize. The stakes are particularly high for Britain, as London is still a major global financial hub both for banks and insurance companies. The City of London played a central role in imposing the sanctions on Iran at the start of the decade – and will be crucial in either renewing the sanctions or trying to counteract them, should Britain join the international coalition trying to save the Iran deal. For Iran, and for Russia and China as well, a major crisis in the U.S.-European relationship, potentially endangering NATO’s cohesion, would be a huge achievement. On its own, it could be a worthwhile incentive for Iran to remain within the JCPOA framework, despite the United States pulling out. 4. Iran symbolically resumes its uranium enrichment  Depending on the severity of the new sanctions and the European response, Iran will have to decide whether to make do with threats to pull out of the JCPOA – but remain with it so as not to lose billions of dollars-worth of sanctions relief – or to pull out for real. Of course, it could first try a middle way. The main component of the deal from the Iranian side is self-imposed limitations on uranium enrichment. With nearly a third of its total of 19,000 centrifuges still operational but currently either not enriching uranium or enriching it only to the relatively low level of 3.67 percent, resuming pre-JCPOA levels to up to 20 percent, or reactivating the centrifuges that the deal still allows to have at the Fordow facility (for research purposes only), would not take long. Recent satellite footage of increased activity around Fordow could point to contingency plans to do just this. Increasing enrichment to pre-JCPOA levels would be in contravention of the deal, but Iran could claim it was the United States that broke the agreement first. And it would not yet be enriching uranium at weapons-grade levels, so it could claim to still be acting within the parameters of the non-proliferation treaty (NPT). Iran would claim it was only asserting its rights for peaceful nuclear research, not working on a weapons program. But it would once again be on the threshold of the “breakout” to a bomb. While such a move would precipitate a crisis, it could still be reversible – a bargaining position. It may serve to make all the sides stop and think. But that’s assuming either the Trump administration or the hard-line faction in Tehran, which has already proven stronger in recent months than the “moderate” faction led by President Hassan Rohani, want to step back from the brink. Another element that could come into play at this stage is Iran’s Revolutionary Guards’ Quds force operating in Syria or Lebanon. According to Israeli intelligence, Iran has for weeks been planning a revenge attack on Israeli targets, following the airstrikes against Iranian bases in Syria attributed to Israel. While the shadow war between Israel and Iran on Syrian soil is seemingly a separate conflict, any escalation on that front will feed directly into the decision-making of all sides on the nuclear issue as well. If a revenge attack is launched, it’s impossible to see how the Trump administration could scale back sanctions or the Europeans make a convincing argument for doing so. 5. Both sides on the brink  The Iran deal was the result of both the United States and Iran reaching the tacit understanding that a diplomatic compromise in the form of an arms-control deal, however unsatisfactory, was preferable to the prospect of war. Obama may have repeatedly said “all options are on the table,” but few in the region were ever convinced he was willing to contemplate the military option against Iran – while Iran trumpeted its rights to nuclear development, but was ultimately prepared to limit those rights in return for the removal of sanctions. Both sides of that equation have fundamentally changed with the election of Trump and the ascendancy of the hard-liner faction in Tehran, which was never in favor of the JCPOA to begin with. How far either side is willing to go now has yet to be seen. The closest thing to a doomsday scenario would see the United States preparing for war in the wake of sanctions, with the biggest military buildup in the Middle East since the eve of the Iraq War in early 2003. That is what it would take if the Iranian response is not just a symbolic ratcheting up of uranium enrichment, but “breakout” – an all-out dash across the nuclear threshold.

In such a case, it will be a no-holds-barred race to prevent Iran from reaching the finishing line that North Korea recently succeeded in crossing. That means war – in Iran, and quite likely in other countries that will be sucked in, including Saudi Arabia, Syria, Lebanon and Israel. Such a scenario still seems far-fetched, but all it would take is a decision in Tehran to change strategy and try to use the period of uncertainty over the JCPOA to win nuclear immunity.

"Oman: The Unsung Hero of the Iranian Nuclear Deal","Select Page By Shohini Gupta | Jul 23, 2015 | Middle East , Viewpoints | 0 |      The US should make Oman its leading ally in the Gulf. T he historic nuclear deal struck between Iran and the P5+1 has been marked by one photo : the foreign ministers of the seven nations standing side by side, beaming. However, this photo is missing a key person in the negotiations: Sultan Qaboos of the Sultanate of Oman. Oman was instrumental in bringing the United States and Iran to the table together, which after decades of sanctions, hostage crises, and opposing security concerns, was a major obstacle to even beginning the discussions that have led to the nuclear deal presented this week. Oman has always had good relations with the United States while also maintaining a strong relationship with Iran ; most other GCC nations actively oppose Iran because they see it as both an economic and ideological threat. Oman’s unique neutral position enabled Sultan Qaboos to mediate between the United States and Iran, the motivations for which mainly regard regional security and personal economic gain . In September of 2011 , Oman facilitated the return of three American hikers jailed in Iran on espionage charges. This first act built confidence within the United States of the Omani commitment to rapprochement between the U.S. and Iran. With this new, successful dynamic in mind, John Kerry (then chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee) met with Qaboos in secret in Muscat in December of that year. Kerry presented the idea of direct discussions with Tehran, an idea which Qaboos greatly encouraged and agreed to facilitate. This meeting set up Oman to become a key player in the future nuclear deal. Muscat hosted the first meeting between the Americans and Iranian officials in July of 2012. In March of 2013, these secret talks continued with Deputy Secretary of State William Burns meeting with Iranian counterpart Majid Ravanchi, where discussions regarding the nuclear deal began. As talks intensified, Qaboos continued to host meetings (some at his own residences) between the two parties through late 2014 , risking his own position within the GCC by keeping news of the meetings secret. During this time, Omani envoys also carried secret messages containing important terms of negotiations between the U.S. and Iran. Even as late as April of 2015 , President Obama made calls to discuss the nuclear deal with Oman, even though P5+1 talks had already ramped up by that point. Oman was instrumental in the easing of relations between the United States and Iran, and was therefore incredibly important to the success of the deal. Most of U.S. foreign policy in the Gulf has been dominated by Saudi Arabia due to its economic, geographic, and ideological influence in the region. However, Oman has proven that it has greater credibility in working cooperatively with the United States to further mutual policy goals in a productive manner. Although its human rights record is somewhat questionable, Oman has not been involved in state-sponsored terrorism unlike its GCC allies. It also has a zero rank on the Global Terrorism Index , a position that very few of its neighbors share. They reserve this position due to a variety of factors. First, both the Consultative and State Councils include representatives from every social faction in the country. These bodies are given the appropriate powers and are not simply figureheads to appease the public. In addition, women are provided equal opportunities in education and careers, a basic right which many nations in the region do not provide. Furthermore, Oman’s official religious narrative called Ihbadi Islam is one of the most tolerant in the faith, a characteristic which has a direct impact on governmental proceedings. What the U.S. needs is a reassessment in the way they approach counterterrorism. While military action may be considered in the immediate future, what is truly needed is governmental reform. However, instead of trying to implement western political structures and ideals, the US needs to encourage models of peace-promoting nations that already exist in the region. Oman is perfect for this function. Although it is still an un-democratic nation, it is a model of political and social stability that and can be described as progressive when it comes to religious and cultural tolerance. If Middle Eastern nations were encouraged to copy their format, transitions to new governments would be much smoother and less contentious and would create less anti-American sentiment. To encourage this process, the U.S. needs to make Oman its leading ally in the Gulf. By fostering stronger economic and political ties with the sultanate, the U.S. will gain greater political legitimacy in the region due to its backing by a nation which has stayed independent even through various pressures. Both Middle Eastern and Western nations will be able to appreciate Oman’s role as a bridge between two ideologies. The U.S. road to counter-terrorism should step away from complete reconstruction; what it needs now is a stable regional ally, and Oman is perfectly poised to take on this role.

"‘Iran lied’: Netanyahu drops a Mossad bombshell on the Iranian nuclear deal","David Horovitz is the founding editor of The Times of Israel. He is the author of "Still Life with Bombers" (2004) and "A Little Too Close to God" (2000), and co-author of "Shalom Friend: The Life and Legacy of Yitzhak Rabin" (1996). He previously edited The Jerusalem Post (2004-2011) and The Jerusalem Report (1998-2004). Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday dropped a Mossad intelligence bombshell on Iran, and on the Obama administration-led international community that negotiated the 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran. He showcased a vast archive of Iran’s own documentation demonstrating that Tehran worked to develop a nuclear weapons arsenal, lied to the international community about it, and has taken the steps necessary to ensure it can proceed to the bomb within the framework of the 2015 deal. In a brief, devastating presentation at the Tel Aviv Defense Ministry headquarters, Netanyahu unveiled what he described as one of Israeli intelligence’s greatest ever achievements — getting its hands on Iran’s own archived nuclear weapons program paperwork: 55,000 pages, and another 55,000 files on 183 CDs, he said. That archive faithfully records the progress of Iran’s comprehensive program to build nuclear weapons, named Project Amad, he noted — speaking in English, for maximal international resonance. And by obtaining that material, he declared, Israel could now incontrovertibly demonstrate that Iran’s leaders have “brazenly” lied to the world, and that the 2015 accord is founded on Iranian “deception.” “100,000 files right here prove that they lied,” he declared, detailing the finds in a slideshow while standing in front of displays of files and CDs.  Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories  Free Sign Up  Watching the prime minister’s presentation in a TV studio, the former head of Military Intelligence in the Israeli army, Amos Yadlin, called the material “conclusive proof” of Tehran’s duplicity — vindication of Israel’s consistent claim that Iran had a nuclear weapons program, continued to work on it in recent years, and duped the world about it. The captured archive material contains “no smoking gun since 2015,” Yadlin observed, because that most recent material presumably hasn’t been archived yet. However, since Iran now demonstrably lied to the world until 2015, Yadlin added dryly, “it has presumably continued to lie since then as well.” Netanyahu said he had already shared the material with the United States, and that the US could vouch for its authenticity. He said he would also share it with other countries and the International Atomic Energy Agency. The prime minister has always opposed the 2015 deal, negotiated by the P5+1 powers led by President Barack Obama. His presentation on Monday was plainly designed, among other factors, to advance his “fix it or nix it” demand — a stance, crucially, shared by US President Donald Trump, who has to decide in less than two weeks whether to withdraw from the accord. The prime minister was notably non-specific regarding what action he thinks the US and the other P5+1 countries should take. As in, should they fix it, or should they nix it? He simply said that he was certain Trump would do “the right thing — the right thing for the United States, the right thing for Israel, and the right thing for the peace of the world.”  jwplayer('DYbH1wGK-50719428').setup({

	}); For the first time anyone could recall, Netanyahu had skipped his scheduled speech at Monday’s opening of the new Knesset session in order to marshall his material and prepare his speech. That cancellation, which came just hours after a reported major raid on an Iranian base in Syria, sparked a mini-panic among some Israelis. Awaiting Netanyahu’s address, the news anchor at Israel’s Hadashot TV news assessed, with only a small degree of exaggeration, that “every household in Israel” was now bracing for the prime minister’s address and wondering whether war with Iran was “inevitable.” “No,” came the succinct answer from military analyst Roni Daniel. Elaborating, a widely respected former Defense Ministry official, Amos Gilad, said in the studio: “Let’s reassure the public: There is no danger of war. And Iran is not attacking us.” Gilad, however, then rather undermined his attempts at defusing panic by adding: “Iran is determined to get rid of Israel. They take the historical view… They are developing missiles. They say the agreement with Obama allows them in eight years time to develop nuclear weapons if they want to…” It is that patient Iranian approach, that relentless Iranian threat, that Netanyahu was determined to highlight in his presentation. To that end, his speech had several complementary goals: First, showing the Iranians the potency of Israel’s security and intelligence apparatuses — capable of removing Iran’s own closely guarded material from right under its nose (and consequently capable of identifying the key personnel, like Mohsen Fakhrizadeh , leading the nuclear weapons program). Second, detailing, stage by stage, the progress of the Iranian nuclear weapons program as gleaned from Iran’s own documents, map, photos and videos — in five stages that he showcased slide by slide: from designing nuclear weapons, to developing nuclear cores, to building nuclear implosion systems, to preparing nuclear tests and, finally, to integrating nuclear weapons on missiles. Third, giving the international community extraordinary evidence on which to formulate a more appropriate response to Tehran’s terrifying duplicity. And, fourth, providing Trump with the intelligence information he needs to take the firmest stance against the maintenance of the 2015 deal in its current form — no matter how derisive or threatening the Iranian response. Will it work? Will the P5+1 countries suddenly discover a new iron will when it comes to confronting the malevolent ayatollahs? Netanyahu, for one, evidently puts little faith in that. But, as he detailed, he has been coordinating with the Trump administration. And the president, within minutes of Netanyahu’s presentation in Tel Aviv, was declaring on the White House lawn that Netanyahu had sent the right message, and that an Iranian path to the bomb in seven years is “not acceptable.” Netanyahu argued Monday, as he has argued consistently all along, that the 2015 accord is “a terrible deal” that “should never have been concluded.” Now, he said, he had the proof. The Obama administration claimed that no deal would have satisfied Israel, but that was always untrue. Israel wanted to see a deal that would dismantle Iran’s entire nuclear weapons program; the 2015 deal simply didn’t do that. Again, Netanyahu now had the proof. Even Monday, armed with that Iranian archive of danger and duplicity, Netanyahu did not demand that the deal be scrapped. He stressed, rather, that the accord, as it stands, gives Iran a clear path to a nuclear arsenal, and asserted that the material he was presenting shows without a shadow of doubt that the Iranians fully intend to follow that path — to enrich mountains of uranium, to develop their ballistic missiles, to weaponize. His message to the world on Iran’s rapacious leaders and their nuclear goals: They’re dangerous. They’re duplicitous. They have to be stopped. And… it’s not too late.","https://www.timesofisrael.com/iran-lied-netanyahu-drops-a-mossad-bombshell-on-the-iranian-nuclear-deal/"
"Trump administration reimposes Iran sanctions lifted under Obama nuclear deal","US PRESIDENT Donald Trump has reimposed Iran sanctions lifted under the nuclear deal. But experts are divided on what his endgame is exactly. The price of a tank of gas has been rising, and coming U.S. sanctions on Iran mean drivers could be in for even more pain at the pump. But that’s not the whole story. WSJ’s Sarah Kent explains why global oil prices are on a knife-edge. Trump administration reimposes Iran sanctions lifted under Obama nuclear deal. Picture: AFP Source:AFP THE United States will add 700 individuals and entities to its Iran blacklist and pressure the global SWIFT banking network to cut off Tehran when expanded sanctions are put in place next week. The aim is to cripple the Iranian economy to pressure Tehran to halt its nuclear activities and what the US says is broad support for “terrorism” in the region, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said. The reimposition of sanctions “is aimed at depriving the regime of the revenues it uses to spread death and destruction around the world,” Mr Pompeo explained. “Our ultimate aim is to compel Iran to permanently abandon its well-documented outlaw activities and behave as a normal country.” US President Donald Trump signs a document reinstating sanctions against Iran after announcing the US withdrawal from the Iran Nuclear deal. Picture: AFP Source:AFP President Trump tweeted what looks like a movie-style poster that takes creative inspiration from the TV series “Game of Thrones” to announce the reimposition of sanctions against Iran. He tweeted a photo of himself with the words “Sanctions are Coming”. However, eight countries will be able to continue importing Iranian oil at lower levels in order to avoid upsetting global crude markets when the sanctions take effect on Monday, the US later said. The sanctions come six months after President Donald Trump withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal struck between world powers and Iran. At the time, he began reimposing sanctions that had been suspended or removed by his predecessor Barack Obama. That process will be completed starting from midnight Sunday, US eastern time, when sanctions on the regime’s banks, shippers, shipbuilders and oil sector are imposed. The impact remains in question as other countries, particularly Washington’s European allies, resist joining its effort to economically strangle the Tehran regime. The European Union has gone so far as to protect businesses that operate in Iran. It has announced plans for a legal framework through which firms can skirt US sanctions, although few major corporations have been eager to risk the wrath of penalties in the world’s largest economy. During the last sanctions period between 2010 and 2015, most of the world lined up behind Washington, and Barack Obama, to help enforce embargoes aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear program. Picture: AFP Source:AFP “This is not 2012 when the world was united behind sanctions against Iran. This is the Trump administration trying to force the rest of the world to go along with a policy that most countries do not accept,” said Barbara Slavin, an Iran expert at the Washington-based Atlantic Council. “The US has had some success in terms of frightening away major corporations. The sanctions hurt a lot. But Iran is still going to be able to sell oil,” especially to China, she said. Mr Pompeo said the US will grant exemptions to eight countries that have pledged to or have already cut back on purchases of petroleum from Iran, which has long depended on crude exports to power its economy. He did not name the eight countries, but they are believed to include India, Japan, South Korea, and possibly China. Mr Pompeo said the countries agreed that the payments for the oil will go into offshore accounts that Iran will only be able to tap for “humanitarian trade, or bilateral trade in non-sanctioned goods and services.” “Maximum pressure means maximum pressure,” he said. President Hassan Rouhani said Iran could resume uranium enrichment “without limit” in response to Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from the nuclear deal in May. Picture: AFP Source:AFP To punish Iranian banks, US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said the global financial network SWIFT — which enables secure bank-to-bank communications and transactions — will also be subject to US sanctions if it provides services to Iranian financial institutions on the US blacklist, which includes most major Iranian banks. That could make it very hard for Iran to do business with other countries. “SWIFT is no different than any other entity,” Mr Mnuchin said. Justifying the action, Mr Pompeo has issued a list of demands for Iran that go well beyond the nuclear program that was the focus of Mr Obama’s deal. He wants the Shiite clerical regime to withdraw from war-ravaged Syria, where it is a critical ally of President Bashar al-Assad, and to end longstanding support to regional militant movements Hezbollah and Hamas. The US also wants Iran to stop backing Yemen’s Huthi rebels, who are facing a US-supported air campaign led by Saudi Arabia. But experts don’t expect Iran’s leaders to immediately throw in the towel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivers a speech, with the words “Iran lied” behind him, on Iran's nuclear program at the defence ministry in Tel Aviv in April. He said he had proof of a “secret”nuclear weapons program. Picture: AFP Source:AFP “It’s basically magical thinking. The Iranians have been able to continue their support to regional proxies and allies for 40 years despite economic pressure,” said Ali Vaez of the International Crisis Group. He said the Trump administration believed that a constrained, struggling Iran would see its influence erode. But the final goal, he said, was unclear. “I think the endgame depends on who you’re asking. The president himself is interested in having a broader, better deal with the Iranians, but I believe that most of his national security team are interested in either destabilising Iran or assuring a regime change in Tehran,” Mr Vaez said.

"Trump Accidentally Just Triggered Global Nuclear Proliferation","Argument:  Trump Accidentally Just Triggered Global Nuclear Proliferation  Trump Accidentally Just Triggered Global N...  On Feb. 1, the Trump administration made good on its threats and began the official withdrawal process from the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty between the United States and Russia. As others have pointed out , this was a short-sighted decision. By withdrawing from the INF Treaty, the Trump administration has eliminated any consequences of Moscow’s alleged noncompliance, leaving it free to deploy as many intermediate-range missiles as it wants. U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to throw out the rulebook instead of trying to enforce it greases the wheels for a return to U.S.-Russian nuclear arms racing—with potentially dire consequences for international security. But there is another outcome of the end of INF Treaty that is less examined and no less dangerous: It will undermine global efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons to countries that don’t yet have them. As an instrument of arms control, the INF Treaty has done much more than limit the capabilities of the individual parties involved. For over 30 years, it has quietly been a central part of the international nonproliferation regime, too. This collection of treaties, informal agreements, and institutions that keep the spread of nuclear weapons in check is often cast in architectural terms: an edifice held up by pillars built on a weathered but enduring foundation. In reality, the nonproliferation regime is a complex and deeply intertwined network that more resembles a spiderweb: stronger than the sum of its parts but likely to unravel if individual threads start to break. Perhaps the most important thread in this tapestry is the long-running tradition of close cooperation between Washington and Moscow on nuclear issues. The INF Treaty itself is a product of their joint efforts, as are the 1968 Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons (commonly known as the NPT), the Nuclear Suppliers Group, and International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards, among others. U.S.-Soviet partnership on nonproliferation remained sacrosanct even during the worst moments of the Cold War, in part thanks to regular interaction between Russian and American officials across a host of treaties and other frameworks. As the historical record shows, just talking to one another, almost regardless of outcome, built up trust and personal rapport that kept cooperation going when times got tough. From this vantage, the INF Treaty’s demise is not just symptomatic of the deep crisis between the two nuclear powers—it is also a contributor to it. Its collapse means the elimination of an official channel for Russian and American interaction at a moment when there are precious few other options. The Special Verification Commission, the pact’s dispute resolution mechanism, convened 30 meetings through the early 2000s but was sorely underutilized in recent years. It would have been the natural setting to address noncompliance allegations—and could have helped to get relations back on track—but this opportunity came off the table when the treaty was scrapped. The importance of U.S.-Russian relations to nonproliferation means that the end of the INF Treaty will affect other areas of the regime, too. As many experts have observed , New START—now the last bastion of bilateral arms control—is probably the most susceptible to contagion. Set to expire in just two years, this 2010 agreement can be extended for up to five years if both parties agree. Emboldened by its withdrawal from the INF Treaty, however, the Trump administration might pass over this silver bullet for the freedom to pursue maximum flexibility in its military options. If this happens, the nuclear arms race that follows might well cause states that have foregone their own deterrent—such as Iran, Saudi Arabia , or even Germany —to reconsider their decisions. Avoiding this outcome was part of the rationale for negotiating both  treaties in the first place. A development like this would be especially dangerous at a time when there is no legally binding instrument that prohibits nuclear testing. The U.S. withdrawal from the INF Treaty or, more precisely, the reasons it did so are relevant here, too. The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT)—which should fill this void—is unenforceable in part because the United States has yet to ratify it. CTBT opponents in Washington often argue that ratification is not in the U.S. interest, however, citing long-debunked stories of Russian covert testing that refuse to die. While the Obama and Trump administrations agree that Russia violated the INF Treaty, scrapping that agreement rather than using the Special Verification Commission to address these allegations (or Russian concerns about U.S. compliance) lends credence to the myth that Moscow is a perennial cheater with whom verification doesn’t work. This story is one that will be hard to un-tell even if a new U.S. administration seeking CTBT ratification is elected in 2020. Both of these outcomes weaken the nonproliferation regime in and of themselves, but they also stand to do real damage to the credibility of the NPT. The cornerstone of the nonproliferation regime, the NPT lays out a bargain between the treaty’s designated nuclear weapon states, which agree to cease the arms race and pursue disarmament, and states that do not already possess nuclear weapons, which pledge not to acquire them. The validity of this bargain has been under scrutiny for decades, particularly by those who feel that the pace of disarmament has been unacceptably slow. This perception will be reinforced by the unraveling of the INF Treaty, which constitutes not just a plateau in arms control but, in the eyes of many, a step backward. Similarly, over the 50 years since the NPT was negotiated, its parties have agreed by consensus on clarifications to the obligations of the designated nuclear weapons states. In 1995, for instance, its parties identified “the determined pursuit by the nuclear-weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally” as a condition for the treaty’s indefinite extension. The INF Treaty’s demise and its related implications for other arms control measures are tangible evidence that these commitments not being fulfilled either—a reality that is unlikely to go unnoticed when the NPT is reviewed in 2019 and 2020. The scrapping of the INF Treaty could lead some observers to conclude that commitments made under the NPT can be ignored, particularly when the political situation isn’t conducive to upholding them. This conclusion is dangerous, and it’s one that will make for a weaker nonproliferation regime at a time when it can ill afford to be anything but robust. As the West grapples with North Korea’s nuclear weapons program, the slow unraveling of the Iran nuclear deal, the need to keep pace with potentially destabilizing new technologies, and the weaponization of nontraditional domains such as space and cyberspace, success will require using the full complement of nonproliferation instruments. This necessarily entails both U.S.-Russia engagement and robust arms control, and with the INF Treaty effectively dead, it comes up short on both scores. The sad irony is that filling the gap the treaty leaves behind will take much more political will than preserving it would have, with few obvious gains. Much of the concern over the end of the INF Treaty has understandably centered on its implications for missile proliferation, the U.S. relationship with NATO, and whether a replacement agreement that includes China can possibly be negotiated. While these are all valid, however, it’s also worth appreciating just how widespread the impact of the end of the treaty is likely to be—particularly with respect to nonproliferation. The international community, experts, and policymakers should start bracing for the ripple effect of its demise. It has the potential to be much more significant—and more pervasive—than they may appreciate.

"Obama official says he pushed a ‘narrative’ to media to sell the Iran nuclear deal","One of President Obama’s top national security advisers led journalists to believe a misleading timeline of U.S. negotiations with Iran over a nuclear agreement and relied on inexperienced reporters to create an “echo chamber” that helped sway public opinion to seal the deal, according to a lengthy magazine profile. Ben Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser for strategic communications, told the New York Times magazine that he helped promote a “narrative” that the administration started negotiations with Iran after the supposedly moderate Hassan Rouhani was elected president in 2013. In fact, the administration’s negotiations actually began earlier, with the country’s powerful Islamic faction, and the framework for an agreement was hammered out before Rouhani’s election. The distinction is important because of the perception that Rouhani was more favorably disposed toward American interests and more trustworthy than the hard-line faction that holds ultimate power in Iran. On Friday, White House press secretary Josh Earnest disputed the notion that there was anything misleading about the administration’s advocacy of the agreement. “I haven’t seen anybody produce any evidence that that’s the case,” he said at his daily briefing. “I recognize there might be some people who are disappointed that they did not succeed in killing the Iran deal. Maybe these unfounded claims are the result of sour grapes. The truth is, the administration, under the direction of the president, engaged in an aggressive campaign to make a strong case to the American people that the international agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon enhanced the national security of the United States.” Rhodes, 38, said in the article that it was easy to shape a favorable impression of the proposed agreement because of the inexperience of many of those covering the issue. “All these newspapers used to have foreign bureaus,” he said. “Now they don’t. They call us to explain to them what’s happening in Moscow and Cairo. Most of the outlets are reporting on world events from Washington. The average reporter we talk to is 27 years old, and their only reporting experience consists of being around political campaigns. That’s a sea change. They literally know nothing.” Rhodes set up a team of staffers who were focused on promoting the deal, which apparently included the feeding of talking points at useful times in the news cycle to foreign policy experts who were favorably disposed toward it. “We created an echo chamber,” he told the magazine. “They [the seemingly independent experts] were saying things that validated what we had given them to say.” The manager of the White House’s Twitter feed on Iran, Tanya Somanader, said one reporter, Laura Rozen of the Al-Monitor news site, became “my RSS feed. She would just find everything and retweet it.” Rozen, in an email, said she does not know Somanader and that David Samuels, the author of the magazine piece, did not ask her about the staffer’s claim before publishing his story. “As I read it, [Somanader] says my Twitter feed was a source of info for her . . . Samuels seems to mischaracterize that to say the opposite.” She said she has had a long interest in U.S. policy on Iran and covered “over 20 rounds of the Iran nuclear deal negotiations” over four years. “I do retweet lots of info, from lots of sources” — including, she noted, the Russian Ministry of Defense, “which I hardly expect most to take at face value or as an endorsement.” She maintained that her coverage of the Iran nuclear diplomacy “was certainly not done as a favor to or in support of any administration.” Rhodes’s assistant, Ned Price, told the newspaper that the administration would feed “color” — background details — to their “compadres” in the press corps, “and the next thing I know, lots of these guys are in the dot-com publishing space, and have huge Twitter followings, and they’ll be putting this message out on their own.” In the article, Rhodes speaks contemptuously of the Washington policy and media establishment, including The Washington Post and the New York Times, referring to them as “the blob” that was subject to conventional thinking about foreign policy. “We had test-drives to know who was going to be able to carry our message effectively, and how to use outside groups like [the anti-nuclear group] Ploughshares, the Iran Project and whomever else. So we knew the tactics that worked,” Rhodes says. Speaking of Republicans and other opponents, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Rhodes adds that he knew “we drove them crazy.” In the piece, he also casts doubt on the moderate nature of Iran’s regime: “I would prefer that it turns out that Rouhani and [Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad] Zarif are real reformers who are going to be steering this country into the direction that I believe it can go in, because their public is educated and, in some respects, pro-American. But we are not betting on that.” Rhodes’s boss, President Obama, has been a strong and consistent advocate for the agreement with Iran, which requires the country to curtail its nuclear program — notably its ability to produce fissile material that could be used in nuclear bombs — in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. He reinforced the misleading administration timeline in announcing the agreement last July. “Today, after two years of negotiations, the United States, together with our international partners, has achieved something that decades of animosity has not,” he said then. Rhodes’s freewheeling and cynical comments reminded several White House and national security reporters of an infamous 2010 story in Rolling Stone magazine in which Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, and aides mocked civilian government officials, including Vice President Biden. McChrystal apologized for the comments but later tendered his resignation, which Obama accepted. The Times article notes that Rhodes is a published short-story writer and aspiring novelist who is a skilled “storyteller.” “He is adept at constructing overarching plotlines with heroes and villains, their conflicts supported by flurries of carefully chosen adjectives, quotations and leaks from named and unnamed senior officials,” Samuels wrote. “He is the master shaper and retailer of Obama’s foreign-policy narratives.”","https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/obama-official-says-he-pushed-a-narrative-to-media-to-sell-the-iran-nuclear-deal/2016/05/06/5b90d984-13a1-11e6-8967-7ac733c56f12_story.html"
"Sen. Cardin critical to preserving Iran nuclear deal","President Trump is planning to announce next week that the Iran deal is not in the U.S. national security interest and that additional sanctions should be imposed on Tehran to prevent it from restarting its nuclear program at some point in the future, according to a person briefed by the White House. (Oct. 5, 2017) President Trump is planning to announce next week that the Iran deal is not in the U.S. national security interest and that additional sanctions should be imposed on Tehran to prevent it from restarting its nuclear program at some point in the future, according to a person briefed by the White House. (Oct. 5, 2017) Over the next three months, the fate of the Iran nuclear agreement and U.S. relations with Iran fall to President Donald Trump and congressional leaders. There is no one as important as Sen. Ben Cardin in determining the fate of this relationship. In the early 1970s, I served as a Peace Corps Volunteer in Mahallat, Iran, a small town between Tehran and Esfahan. Today, I belong to the Peace Corps Iran Association, which works to improve relations between our countries. At least 1,500 volunteers served between 1962 and 1976. We have very strong and fond memories of our Iranian friends, colleagues and communities. We saw how deeply Iranians value their history as a nation and a great culture. And we experienced the hospitality for which Iranians are renowned. Peace Corps left Iran before the revolution and ensuing events, but we have held out hope that in time the rift between our countries would be overcome. The nuclear agreement is a monumental step in that direction. I write today out of deep concern over reported negotiations Senator Cardin has had with Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee and National Security Advisor Herbert R. McMaster. As I understand it, they are trying to draft legislation to fulfill President Trump’s Jan. 12 ultimatum regarding the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), commonly known as the Iran nuclear deal. For months President Donald Trump’s top advisers and a chorus of national security and defense experts have been telling him that the U.S. should stick to the Iran nuclear accord negotiated by the Obama administration in 2015. Despite the fact that the deal isn’t perfect, it still may be our last... The president’s ultimatum has four conditions: The president’s unilateral demands could well bring down the nuclear agreement. Attempting to impose these conditions serves neither our security nor that of our allies. Working within the framework of the existing agreement is a far safer and more promising path to addressing outstanding issues in the future. Several of these conditions are unnecessary. For others, the timing and unilateral intent are wrong. For example, inspections already are an integral part of the JCPOA, and the International Atomic Energy Agency has “multilayered oversight over Iran’s entire nuclear supply chain.” And by all reports, Iran is complying. In other words, the JCPOA is keeping Iran from developing nuclear weapons. Within the 10- to 15-year time frame of the agreement, additional control options may be developed. The issue of missiles is better addressed in conjunction with other countries. Just this fall, U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron expressed willingness to do just this. Sen. Ben Cardin is losing his role as the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, ending a run that began almost three years ago with the tricky politics of the Iran nuclear deal . Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Tuesday that Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey would return... Senators Cardin and Corker, General McMaster and Congress itself face a quandary: Any of these four demands would scuttle the agreement. Perhaps that is the president’s intention, but I would wonder if he has thought through the consequences. I realize that Senator Cardin voted against the agreement, but I also know from speaking with his staff that he understands the importance of honoring the agreement and making sure it works, now that it is in place. At this time the world needs more diplomacy, not more conflict. Already, threats of nuclear war are emanating from both the White House and North Korea. To back away from this agreement or to instigate its collapse would empower Iran to pursue nuclear weapons. Quite possibly, this action could even launch a nuclear arms race between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Reneging on our agreement undermines the credibility of the United States. It creates ill will and deep distrust from all our partners in the agreement, including the United Kingdom, France, Germany, the European Union , China, Russia and Iran, and makes it much harder to resolve issues with Iran — short of war — in the future. In the ancient world, King Croesus of Lydia consulted the Oracles of both Delphi and Thebes to determine whether to invade the Persian Empire of Cyrus the Great. Both oracles gave the same reply, which was, “If you make war on the Persians, you will destroy a great empire.” He went to war and the prophecy was fulfilled. Unfortunately, the empire that was destroyed was his own. I implore Senator Cardin, along with his colleagues on the Foreign Relations Committee including Ranking Member Bob Menendez, not to make any compromises that would jeopardize the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.","https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/oped/bs-ed-op-0212-iran-cardin-20180208-story.html"
"Iran: The case for protecting humanitarian trade","Ellie Geranmayeh & James Miller    13th September, 2018  New US sanctions will put the health of ordinary Iranians at risk. Europe can take concrete steps to minimise this – steps which also support its ongoing commitment to the nuclear deal A crisis is looming in Iran’s healthcare sector: patients are reporting shortages in life-saving medicine. The situation is expected to worsen once US sanctions on Iran are reimposed in November. European and US companies that can provide the advanced medicine and equipment needed to treat chronic diseases inside Iran are grappling with how to sustain their operations. The goods that are making it into Iran are being sold at soaring prices due to a sharp currency downturn following Donald Trump’s sanctions decision. Millions of ordinary Iranians are bracing themselves for the impact of these sanctions. The UN special rapporteur for human rights warned that the sanctions will undermine human rights in the country, drive people into poverty, and make imported goods unaffordable. The impact of incoming sanctions on the humanitarian sector contradicts the US administration’s repeated statements in support of the Iranian people. In this series of commentaries, ECFR assesses the likely impact of US sanctions on economic ties between Europe and Iran, covering strategically important areas such as trade in essential goods, energy, and banking. The series examines how European governments can minimise the fallout of their attempts to maintain Iranian compliance with the nuclear deal. Part 1: Trump’s Iran sanctions: an explainer on their impact for Europe Part 2: Iran: The case for protecting humanitarian trade Part 3: Can Iran weather the oil-sanctions storm? Part 4: Bankless task: can Europe stay connected to Iran? Part 5: Iran oil exports: 8 waivers and the upcoming OPEC meeting Part 6: Trading with Iran via the special purpose vehicle: How it can work Iranians experienced similar hardship between 2012-2013 when the United States and Europe introduced the severest of sanctions to pressure Iran to restrict its nuclear programme. At the time, the US Treasury provided broad authorisation and exceptions for the sale of medicine and medical devices. Yet only a limited number of Western companies managed to operate under these conditions. Many were forced to halt or downsize trade due to disruptions in banking and high operational costs. A repeat of this situation must be prevented. Unilateral US sanctions must not be allowed to needlessly cause suffering to millions of Iranian citizens. This is especially the case given that Iran continues to implement restrictions on its nuclear programme under the 2015 deal. Europe, China, and Russia have also vowed to uphold the agreement. The overarching hurdle facing many companies that export medical goods and services to Iran is related to securing banking services and finance to enable such transactions to happen. This includes a recent foreign currency shortage with which to reimburse European companies. The lack of clarity over how the US will enforce its sanctions has exacerbated these problems. For example, while the latest US OFAC guidelines reaffirm that there is broad authorisation for humanitarian transactions, there is ambiguity over how extensively the US will use secondary sanctions to target private Iranian banks. Since the nuclear deal, such banks were clearly exempt from secondary sanctions. That meant that non-US companies could establish ties with such banks to facilitate payments for the sale of humanitarian goods to Iran. Their position is now unclear. The US has outlined plans to sanction the Central Bank of Iran (CBI); but it is inevitable that any local private Iranian bank will have to transact with the CBI. Under the current US sanctions framework it is unclear if this would trigger a designation for that local bank, meaning that European banks would most likely refuse to transact with that entity. Such uncertainty can effectively block payment channels into Iran and prevent life-saving assistance from reaching doctors and Iranian patients. Indeed, several leading pharmaceutical companies currently engaged in Iran have shared with us their concerns that banks, insurance companies, and distribution channels that have facilitated humanitarian trade with Iran are getting cold feet, fearing they could fall foul of US sanctions. Competing interpretations of the OFAC guidelines also are causing over-compliance by European companies whose board members are reluctant to accept reputational damage in the US even for humanitarian exchanges with Iran. Sanctions have repeatedly hit ordinary people the hardest and resulted in a negative impact on health in the targeted country For Iranians, access to basic healthcare is a constitutionally protected fundamental human right. In recent years, health conditions in Iran have been gradually improving for underprivileged patients. In part this has been due to the easing of international sanctions that have made healthcare products more affordable and easily accessible. President Hassan Rouhani’s government also introduced new reforms that offer healthcare to almost 11 million previously unprotected people. Treatment for chronic diseases is a major challenge for Iran where successful treatment requires advanced devices, training, and pharmaceuticals that are often provided through Western companies. Protecting access of such companies to Iran is therefore imperative. As global powers look to salvage the nuclear deal despite the US withdrawal, they should seek to preserve humanitarian trade with Iran. Despite opposing views between Europe and the US on the nuclear agreement, saving the lives of Iranians should not be a topic of debate. Brian Hook, the newly appointed US special representative for Iran, recently stated that the US and Europe should be working together to “find lasting solutions that truly support Iran’s people”. Europe should press the US to fulfil this offer by working to immediately facilitate and remove obstacles to humanitarian trade with Iran. European governments should urge the US Treasury to quickly clarify the ambiguities created by its latest guidelines and ensure that a reasonable number of Iranian private financial institutions remain exempt from US secondary sanctions. The European Union should double down on efforts to ensure payment channels with Iran are preserved, including Iran’s access to the SWIFT financial messaging service. As a matter of priority it should aim for banks in Europe to remain open for humanitarian trade with Iran. To help foreign companies sustain the profit margins of operations inside Iran, the Iranian government could also offer cost-saving incentives for companies that import medicine and medical goods into the country. The European Commission recently announced it will provide an €18m economic package for the social benefit of ordinary Iranians. If required, it should introduce similar new provisions after November to bridge any gaps in funding and payment facilities for medicine exported by European companies. This lending mechanism (in euros as opposed to US dollars), should be large enough to at least cover the import of life-saving medicine into Iran and should be flexible enough to respond to new needs. The EU and Iran could also consider establishing a medical fund for donating pharmaceuticals and equipment to Iran. In such instances, no banking transactions will be required and therefore the risks to European companies will be reduced. The EU could also encourage expanded scientific cooperation with Iran in medical research and training. Relative to many countries in the Middle East, Iran has advanced public and private medical research institutions that are likely to welcome such bilateral cooperation. In fact, Iranian and US scientists have long engaged in successful health diplomacy projects. European governments can support and facilitate such humanitarian-focused projects. Such measures from Europe can demonstrate that their commitment to the humanitarian needs of Iranian people goes beyond rhetoric. Many Western governments view sanctions as an effective economic tool to alter the actions of adversary states. Yet sanctions have repeatedly hit ordinary people the hardest and resulted in a negative impact on health in the targeted country. The human cost of sanctions in countries such as Iraq, Iran, Syria, and Venezuela has been severe. Going forward, the international community must implement safeguards to fully protect humanitarian sectors of trade. As Europe pledges to demonstrate its commitment to the Iran nuclear deal, it could take a lead in this dialogue and provide concrete solutions.

"Iranian ships fire rockets as US aircraft carrier enters Persian Gulf","ABOARD THE USS JOHN C. STENNIS IN THE PERSIAN GULF (AP) — A US aircraft carrier sailed into the Persian Gulf on Friday, becoming the first since America’s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal and breaking the longest carrier absence in the volatile region since at least the September 11 terror attacks. The arrival of the USS John C. Stennis comes as Iranian officials have returned to repeatedly threatening to close off the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf through which a third of all oil traded by sea passes. Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps vessels shadowed the Stennis and its strike group, at one point launching rockets away from it and flying a drone nearby. The long absence of a carrier, however, could become a standard practice here as now-outgoing Defense Secretary Jim Mattis sought to shake up naval operations and American air bases spanning the region can scramble fighter jets and drones.  Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories  Free Sign Up  “We are trying to be more operationally unpredictable,” said Lt. Chloe Morgan, a spokeswoman for US’s Bahrain-based 5th Fleet. “Now we’re switching it up because our adversaries are watching closely. We want to be operationally unpredictable to our enemies, but strategically predictable to our partners.” The Navy invited journalists to ride on the nuclear-powered Stennis, whose homeport is Bremerton, Washington, as it transited the Strait of Hormuz. The strait at its narrowest point is 33 kilometers (21 miles) wide, in the waters between Iran and Oman. Despite being so narrow and within the territorial waters of those two nations, the strait is viewed as an international transit route. American forces routinely travel through the area, despite sometimes tense encounters with Iran’s Revolutionary Guard, a paramilitary force answerable only to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. For Iran’s part, they compare the American presence to Tehran sending warships to the Gulf of Mexico. Tensions have been high since US President Donald Trump’s May withdrawal from Iran’s nuclear deal, which saw sanctions lifted for Tehran limiting its uranium enrichment. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, a relative moderate within the country’s Shiite theocracy whose major achievement was the deal, has repeatedly warned any attempt to stop Iran’s export of crude oil could see it close off the strait. However, the 5th Fleet says it has not seen any “unsafe and unprofessional” actions by Iranian naval forces in the Persian Gulf since August 2017 before the Stennis’ transit through the strait. Throughout its trip Friday, some 30 Iranian Revolution Guard vessels trailed the Stennis and its strike group. One small vessel launched what appeared to be a commercial-grade drone to film the American ships. Photographers and videographers on the Iranian boats could clearly be seen also filming the Stennis while journalists on board the aircraft carrier filmed them. “The Iranian craft drove in front of our ship and stopped and tried to capture their own sort of picture of what was going on,” said Capt. Randy Peck, the commanding officer of the Stennis. There was no immediate mention of the Stennis’ arrival to the Persian Gulf in Iranian state media. The long gap between carrier deployments in the Persian Gulf represents a change in US military strategy dating back to the first Gulf War in 1991 and the overflights of Iraq that followed for years after. Mattis, as the head of the US military’s Central Command, himself demanded two carrier groups in the Persian Gulf as he led the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Since then, Mattis has said he wants a more unpredictable Navy to respond to Russia and China, which he sees as the “great power competition” America now faces. “The way you do this is we ensure that preparation for great power competition drives not simply a rotation schedule that allows me to tell you, three years from now, which aircraft carrier will be where,” Mattis told a US House committee in April. “That’s a great way to run a shipping line. It’s no way to run a Navy.” It’s unclear, however, whether Mattis’ strategy will continue. The defense secretary resigned Thursday after clashing with Trump over the abrupt withdrawal of US troops from Syria. The US military also operates air bases in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, as well as a major Army base in Kuwait and its Navy base in Bahrain. That offers the American military a variety of locations both in the Persian Gulf, as well as other bases in the wider Mideast, to launch strikes. “Carriers were needed to support many of the initial strikes in Afghanistan in 2001, some attacks in Iraq in 2003, and most tactical missions in Syria in 2011,” said Bryan Clark, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments. “After access to adequate ground bases was obtained for today’s operations in Syria and Iraq, carrier-based aircraft were not as essential for these missions.” “The US does not need carriers in the Persian Gulf,” he added. As military operations wind down in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, that likely will mean less need for airstrikes as well. However, the 5th Fleet still maintains a fleet of 21 ships from Bahrain and other Navy ships will continue to transit the strait. “The American Navy is showing they’re committed to regional stability all across the globe but particularly in the Gulf region,” Peck said. “It’s a very economically important area for the entire world, so we’re going to continue to go wherever we can internationally, in international waters.”","https://www.timesofisrael.com/us-aircraft-carrier-enters-persian-gulf-after-longest-post-9-11-absence/"
"Trump slaps Europe in the face with Iran deal pull-out","By Georgi Gotev | EURACTIV.com with AFP  German Chancellor Angela Merkel (L) talks to French President Emmanuel Macron (R) and US President Donald J. Trump (C) at the beginning of the plenary session of the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany, 7 July 2017. [Felipe Trueba/EPA/EFE] Comments  Print    In the aftermath of Donald Trump’s announcement to withdraw from a landmark deal curbing Iran’s nuclear programme, the leaders of Britain, France and Germany who signed the agreement published a joint statement saying they will continue to stick by it. President Donald Trump pulled out from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPoA), the official name of the 2015 deal curbing Iran’s nuclear on Tuesday (8 May), defying European pleas and prompting international outcry. Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iran deal drew comparisons with his move last June to pull out from the Paris climate agreement. Similarly, the European reaction to continue with the Paris deal bears resemblance with the vow to forge ahead with the Iran deal. European leaders reacted with anger and defiance after President Donald Trump yesterday (1 June) announced the United States, the world’s second biggest carbon emitter, was quitting the 2015 Paris Agreement. The big difference however is that this time the US prepares to slam heavy sanctions on its allies who are doing business in Iran. Another aspect is the toxic effect of this announcement for the Middle East, the EU’s backyard. Trump's decision to withdraw from #IranDeal is his biggest slap in the face to date to US allies.

Statement on the Iran Nuclear Deal: https://t.co/O3SpryCKkc — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 8, 2018 Slapping aside more than a decade and a half of careful diplomacy by Britain, China, France, Germany, Iran, Russia and past US administrations, Trump called for a “new and lasting deal.” That grand bargain, he said, would have to include not just deeper restrictions on Iran’s nuclear programme, but on its ballistic missiles and support for militant groups across the Middle East. “We cannot prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb under the decaying and rotten structure of the current agreement,” he claimed. “We will not allow American cities to be threatened with destruction and we will not allow a regime that chants ‘Death to America’ to gain access to the most deadly weapons on Earth.” It remains far from clear if the international community, or Iran, will play along. Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani — whose standing at home now risks being undermined by the deal’s collapse — was furious, accusing Trump of “psychological warfare”. Trump’s onerous demands and his warning that Iranians deserve better than their current “dictatorship” will only heighten suspicions his ultimate goal is regime change. “If the regime continues its nuclear aspirations, it will have bigger problems than it has ever had before,” he warned. Hawkish US officials believe that after 38 years in power, Iran’s clerical regime is substantially weakened by domestic economic pressure, changing demography, public demonstrations, and costly foreign military adventures. The decision marked a stark diplomatic defeat for Europe, whose leaders, repeatedly and in person, begged the mercurial US leader to think again. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Wednesday (2 May) that the nuclear deal with Iran should not be cancelled but its negotiating framework needed to be broadened. In a joint statement, Germany’s Angela Merkel, Britain’s Theresa May and France’s Emmanuel Macron voiced their “regret and concern” at Trump’s decision.

The European Union is determined to act in accordance with its security interests and to protect its economic investments.” Washington’s new ambassador to Berlin, Richard Grenell, said on Twitter: “US sanctions will target critical sectors of Iran’s economy.

German companies doing business in Iran should wind down operations immediately. — Richard Grenell (@RichardGrenell) May 8, 2018 And Treasury Secretary Stephen Mnuchin made it clear that Washington was acting “under both our primary and secondary sanctions authorities,” meaning that European firms with investments or operations in the United States could be targeted if they continue to trade with Iran. In a sign of the depth of European displeasure, plans are already being drawn up in Brussels to introduce measures blocking US sanctions, an extremely rare move against an allied government. While Iran’s arch foes in Israel and Saudi Arabia welcomed Trump’s decision, signatories to the existing deal vowed to plow ahead without the United States. Trump’s decision offers him a domestic political victory, fulfilling a longstanding campaign promise and underscoring his no nonsense political brand. But the long term impact for American foreign policy and for the Middle East was less clear. Former US president Barack Obama — whose administration inked the deal — made a rare public criticism of his successor, describing Trump’s decision to abandon the Iran nuclear deal as “misguided” and a “serious mistake.” “The consistent flouting of agreements that our country is a party to risks eroding America’s credibility, and puts us at odds with the world’s major powers.” In contrast, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who last week released a trove of intelligence on a pre-2003 Iranian plan to develop a nuclear weapon which Trump cited approvingly in his speech, was overjoyed. “Israel fully supports President Trump’s bold decision today to reject the disastrous nuclear deal,” Netanyahu said, in a televised address. Shortly after, Syrian state media reported nine pro-government fighters were killed in an Israeli missile strike near Damascus, where Iranian proxies are known to operate. Israel had already opened bomb shelters and put the military on high alert in case of attack from the Iranian forces deployed in Syria in defence of Bashar al-Assad’s regime. Energy industry insiders say Trump’s tough stance on Iran will probably keep oil prices higher than they would otherwise be. The European Commission was unable yesterday to answer questions how would higher oil prices impact on the European economies. . @realDonaldTrump 's verdict on #Iran deal will be not only his most important decision on diplomatic front-the economic impact may be huge too.

"","“We are not worried about America’s cruel decisions ... We are prepared for all scenarios and no change will occur in our lives next week,” Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani said. | Atta Kenare/AFP/Getty Images 'We are not worried about America’s cruel decisions,' Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said Monday. By QUINT FORGEY Updated 05/07/2018 09:13 AM EDT President Hassan Rouhani of Iran claimed the Middle Eastern power “will continue to remain committed” to the multinational nuclear agreement the Obama administration brokered in 2015 — even if President Donald Trump terminates U.S. involvement in the deal later this week. “We are not worried about America’s cruel decisions ... We are prepared for all scenarios and no change will occur in our lives next week,” Rouhani said Monday in a speech broadcast live on state television and reported by Reuters. “If we can get what we want from a deal without America, then Iran will continue to remain committed to the deal. What Iran wants is our interests to be guaranteed by its non-American signatories ... In that case, getting rid of America’s mischievous presence will be fine for Iran.” Story Continued Below Trump seems poised to withdraw from the deal on Saturday, when a decision is due on whether to extend a suspension of sanctions against Iran — fulfilling a campaign trail pledge and satisfying hawkish Republicans in Congress who have long opposed the atomic agreement. "It was insane. Ridiculous. It should have never been made," Trump said late last month, warning that Iranian officials are “going to have big problems, bigger than they've ever had before” if they restart their nuclear program. “If they want to make sure that we are not after a nuclear bomb, we have said repeatedly that we are not and we will not be,” Rouhani said Monday. “But if they want to weaken Iran and limit its influence whether in the region or globally, Iran will fiercely resist.” Rouhani’s announcement comes as Vice President Mike Pence is set to meet Monday with U.K. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson — the third European ally to descend upon Washington, D.C., in recent weeks in an attempt to persuade U.S. officials to maintain the pact with Britain, China, France, Germany, Iran and Russia.

But speaking to journalists before leaving the U.S., Macron said his efforts were largely unsuccessful. “I can hear. I seemed to constantly hear that he [Trump] had no serious desire to maintain or defend” the agreement, the French president said. “I consider that it’s a campaign pledge he made long ago … I don’t know. Rational analysis does not lead me to think he will stay in the deal.” To help justify American withdrawal from the deal, Trump may invoke a spate of documents Israeli forces recently obtained from an Iranian “atomic archive.” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel heralded the new intelligence as revelatory in a televised address last month, though the seized files predate the 2015 nuclear deal do not reveal a technical violation of the agreement. “Iran lied. Big time. After signing the nuclear deal in 2015, Iran intensified its effort to hide its nuclear files,” Netanyahu said, arguing the deal was negotiated in bad faith. “These files conclusively prove that Iran is brazenly lying when it said it never had a nuclear weapons program," he added. "This atomic archive clearly showed that Iran planned at the highest levels to continue work on nuclear weapons under different guises." During a White House news conference following the Israeli leader's remarks, Trump said: "That is just not an acceptable situation.” The president also warned that Iran was not merely "sitting back idly," but declined to say whether he would pull out of the agreement. “We’ll see what happens," Trump said. "I’m not telling you what I’m doing, but a lot of people think they know.” Missing out on the latest scoops? Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning — in your inbox.

"President Trump plans to 'decertify' Iran nuclear deal next week","Updated 7:37 AM ET, Fri October 6, 2017 Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump plans to "decertify" the Iran nuclear deal next week, declaring the Obama-era pact not in US interests and launching a congressional review period on the accord, according to two senior US officials. Stockpiles & centrifuges: The deal has curbed Iran's nuclear program, reducing its stockpiles of enriched uranium by 97 percent and cutting the number of its centrifuges by two-thirds. Uranium enrichment: It still allows Iran to continue enrichment -- enough for civil use to power parts of the country, but not enough to build a nuclear bomb. Inspections: Iran is required to provide inspectors from the UN's nuclear watchdog access to monitor its declared nuclear facilities. Compliance: Every 90 days, the US President must certify to Congress that Iran is keeping up its end of the deal. If the President does not certify the agreement, Congress has a statutory 60-day period to decide whether to reimpose sanctions. Sanctions: If Iran doesn't comply, US, European Union, and UN nuclear-related sanctions on the Iranian economy would be reinstated. A number of non-nuclear-related sanctions currently remain in place.","https://www.cnn.com/2017/10/05/politics/trump-iran-deal-deadline-plan/index.html"
"Here’s What Happens if Trump Really Decides to Decertify the Iran Deal","Lawfare:  Here’s What Happens if Trump Really Decides to Decertify the Iran Deal  Here’s What Happens if Trump Really Decid...  The Washington Post  reported yesterday that next week, U.S. President Donald Trump may announce that he will “decertify” the Iran nuclear deal because it is not in the interest of the United States to continue implementing it. The administration faces an Oct. 15 deadline to certify to Congress that Iran is complying with the agreement and that it remains in the United States’ interest to follow it, as mandated by the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act (INARA). The announcement would be part of the broader introduction of a new U.S. strategy toward Iran that would address the country’s support for terrorism, involvement in Middle East violence, and ballistic missile development, in addition to the nuclear issue . In a meeting with senior military leaders yesterday, Trump once again criticized Iran’s behavior and asserted that the country has “not lived up to the spirit of their agreement.” He did not say that Iran has violated any of its concrete obligations under the agreement. However, the Washington Post report makes it clear that no final decisions have been made at this point. It also indicates that even if Trump decertified the agreement, he would “hold off on recommending that Congress reimpose sanctions.” This caveat suggests that decertification might not immediately lead to the reinstatement of U.S. nuclear sanctions against Iran. Additional measures, either congressional or executive, would be necessary to actually reimpose sanctions. The Iran nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), was concluded between Iran and the members of the P5+1 , as well as the European Union, in July 2015. Iran agreed to concessions regarding its nuclear program in return for extensive sanctions relief. The agreement was endorsed by United Nations Security Council Resolution 2231 . Subsequently, on JCPOA “implementation day” on January 16, 2016, the United States and the EU lifted most of their respective sanctions imposed in connection with Iran’s nuclear program, after the International Atomic Energy Agency verified that Iran has implemented its nuclear-related obligations under the JCPOA. Previous Security Council resolutions regarding Iran’s nuclear program have been terminated. The Barack Obama administration maintained that the JCPOA was not legally binding and, therefore, did not require Senate approval. The U.S. could stop implementing it at any time without violating its obligations under international law (see Jimmy Chalk’s post ). In order to fulfill the United States’ commitment, the administration relied on pre-existing authorities that gave the president discretion in the application of sanctions against Iran (see Jack Goldsmith’s post and lecture ). Specifically, the administration utilized existing waiver authorities that previous sanctions legislation had granted to the president. Executive orders allowed the president to impose other sanctions and could be withdrawn with relative ease. The Obama administration’s stance that congressional approval was not necessary for concluding the Iran deal drew the ire of legislators and led to the enactment of INARA, an amendment to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. The act required the president to submit any nuclear agreement with Iran for congressional review and imposed additional reporting and certification requirements to allow congressional oversight of the implementation of such an agreement. For current purposes, the key provisions are those regarding certification of compliance. INARA requires the president to certify every 90 days that Iran is in compliance with the JCPOA and that it remains in U.S. interest to suspend sanctions as part of the implementation of any agreement: (d)(6) COMPLIANCE CERTIFICATION — After the review period provided in subsection (b), the President shall, not less than every 90 calendar days — (A) determine whether the President is able to certify that — (i) Iran is transparently, verifiably, and fully implementing the agreement, including all related technical or additional agreements; (ii) Iran has not committed a material breach with respect to the agreement or, if Iran has committed a material breach, Iran has cured the material breach; (iii) Iran has not taken any action, including covert activities, that could significantly advance its nuclear weapons program; and (iv) suspension of sanctions related to Iran pursuant to the agreement is — (I) appropriate and proportionate to the specific and verifiable measures taken by Iran with respect to terminating its illicit nuclear program; and (II) vital to the national security interests of the United States; and (B) if the President determines he is able to make the certification described in subparagraph (A), make such certification to the appropriate congressional committees and leadership. Despite his vocal criticism of the JCPOA and repeated claims that it is inadequate, Trump has previously certified that Iran is in compliance with the agreement. So far, the Trump administration has also extended the Iran sanctions waivers. If President Trump really does decertify the JCPOA, he would probably trigger major political and diplomatic blowback from the other parties to the agreement and, perhaps more importantly, from Iran. The mere prospect of decertification has already provoked statements from multiple parties to the JCPOA urging the United States to continue implementing the agreement. However, decertification would have no automatic consequences in terms of U.S. implementation of the agreement with respect to the continued suspension of sanctions that had been waived or rescinded under the JCPOA. In order to have such an effect, decertification must be accompanied by measures to reimpose sanctions. Sanctions could be reinstated in several ways. Congress could introduce legislation to reimpose sanctions within 60 days of the deadline for certification. Such legislation would be entitled to INARA’s expedited consideration procedures. Alternatively, the president could decline to exercise the waivers that have suspended the implementation of sanctions legislation thus far. The president could also reinstate designations of Iranian persons and entities as Specially Designated Nationals (SDNs) pursuant to executive order. Such designations would also trigger secondary sanctions like those provided for in the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010, a law that restricts the access of third-country financial institutions with ties to Iran-related SDNs to the U.S. market. Finally, the United States could move to reimpose U.N. sanctions by triggering the “snapback” mechanism agreed upon in the JCPOA (more on that here ). So far, the administration has not indicated that it intends to take any of those steps to unilaterally reimpose sanctions. Thus, the Post ’s report that the Trump plans to “hold off on recommending that Congress reimpose sanctions on Iran” is somewhat puzzling. The president does not really need Congress in order to reinstate sanctions that were lifted in the framework of the nuclear deal. He can do so by exercising authorities that he already has through waivers or executive orders. (For more information, see this Congressional Research Service report that concluded: “It is unlikely that the President would require the approval of Congress” for unilaterally reimposing sanctions.) Trump’s statement suggests that, in reality, the administration might not be in a hurry to gut the JCPOA by reneging on the United States’ core obligations under the agreement. Decertification without reintroducing sanctions would allow the administration to express its dissatisfaction with the terms of the JCPOA for political gain while preserving the core of the agreement and providing an incentive for Iran to continue meeting its nuclear obligations. (Unless, of course, Congress moves to reinstate sanctions in response to the president’s decertification of the JCPOA.) The move might also intend to create leverage for potential renegotiation of the JCPOA, although there seems to be no appetite for that among the other parties to the agreement. In any event, it seems that the ball is now in Congress’s court.

"Trump Can Make the Most of a Bad Iran Deal","Advertisement Supported by Op-Ed Contributor By  Michael Singh WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said last month that United States policy toward Iran shouldn’t begin and end with the nuclear deal. Washington’s issues with that country are far wider, Mr. Tillerson said, citing Iran’s meddling in Syria and Iraq, and its support for terrorist groups like Hezbollah. The secretary of state is certainly right about that. But he elided an important point: Without a stable approach to the nuclear deal, questions about its fate will distract from and ultimately hobble broader American diplomacy on Iran and other crucial issues in the Middle East. President Trump — who campaigned on promises to tear up the nuclear deal — has indicated that in mid-October, when the next 90-day deadline for recertifying Iran’s compliance with the agreement arrives, he will find that Iran has violated it. This could lead to the deal’s collapse. But there seems to be little evidence that Iran is actually cheating in any significant way. The Iranians appear to be exploiting loopholes in the deal and trying to get away with what they can when it comes to the deal’s limits on certain nuclear activities like the production and storage of heavy water. Likewise, they seem to be ignoring injunctions on missile launches levied by the United Nations but not actually included in the nuclear agreement itself. None of these appear to constitute a material breach of the agreement. The problem the United States faces is not Iranian compliance, but the very terms of the agreement. Mr. Trump isn’t wrong when he says it’s a “bad deal.” It’s too narrow in scope, permitting Iran to work on its missile and centrifuge technology even while uranium enrichment is paused. More worrying, it’s only temporary. Some of its strictures begin to phase out in less than a decade, during which time Tehran can expand its power in the Middle East, just as the United States’ tools for trying to keep it in check — in particular, sanctions — are limited. But like it or not, the clock is not so easily turned back. Any realistic Iran policy must take this as its starting point. Rather than ripping up the deal or simply acquiescing to it, the Trump administration should strengthen both the deal and the policy framework of which it is a part. Stability on the issue of the nuclear agreement will eliminate a distraction and create leverage to rally international support for a better Middle East strategy. That’s why the United States should work with allies to more strictly interpret the existing text of the accord. Along with Britain, France and Germany — sometimes known as the E.U.3 — the United States should close any loopholes being exploited by Iran, increase intelligence cooperation on Iran’s nuclear activities and push international inspectors to interpret their mandate more broadly. These allies should also agree to enforce United Nations rules that aren’t included in the agreement, like those strictly limiting Iran’s arms trade. Working with these same allies, the United States should also tackle issues omitted from the nuclear deal, like Iran’s missile program. Through a package of sanctions, export controls, interdictions and missile defense, they should aim to prevent Iran from acquiring an intercontinental ballistic missile and from continuing to export missile technology. The United States and the E.U.3 should also address the problem of the nuclear deal’s expiration date by jointly declaring now that they intend to expand and extend the agreement, rather than allow Iran’s nuclear activities to suddenly increase when it expires. In parallel, they should seek to strengthen global nonproliferation efforts so that even if nuclear restrictions specific to Iran cannot be extended, Tehran faces more challenges to weaponization when the deal does lapse. All of this must go hand in hand with a larger strategy to counter Iranian aggression in the Middle East. Iran’s leaders appear to be increasingly self-confident, perceiving success in Syria , Iraq and Yemen . And Iran is steadily expanding its network of proxies . To reverse these trends, the United States must move from generalities about countering Iran to specific aims — for example, preventing Iranian forces from entrenching in the Golan Heights , or deterring the use of anti-ship cruise missiles in the Bab el Mandeb Strait off Yemen’s coast. American officials need to communicate these boundaries to Iran and back them up with a range of tools, including sanctions, diplomacy and limited military force if necessary. These measures require help from America’s allies, who are not eager to fiddle with the nuclear agreement or face up to the problem of Iran’s regional policies. This is where diplomacy comes in. Allies in Europe and elsewhere know the deal is controversial in Washington, and they take seriously Mr. Trump’s threats to stop honoring it. Policy makers in Washington should make clear that their allies’ cooperation with efforts to strengthen the deal and counter Iran are required to avoid that outcome. The United States cannot subordinate its entire policy toward Iran or the Middle East to the preservation of the nuclear accord. And it shouldn’t shoulder sole responsibility for addressing Iran’s threats while Europe enjoys the deal’s benefits. Even then, this would constitute only the start of a policy for addressing the challenge of Iran. Iran is adept at exploiting chaos, which is endemic in the Middle East. Washington will need sound approaches to the wars in Syria and Yemen, Iraq’s fragility and other regional challenges like the fight between Qatar and its neighbors . But none of this will be possible if there is an international crisis every time there’s a new deadline for certifying compliance or waiving sanctions.

"Iran’s Supreme Leader Says Sanctions Must Lift When Nuclear Deal Is Signed","Advertisement Supported by By  Thomas Erdbrink and David E. Sanger TEHRAN — Iran ’s supreme leader on Thursday challenged two of the United States’ bedrock principles in the nuclear negotiations, declaring that all economic sanctions would have to be lifted on the day any final agreement was signed and that military sites would be strictly off limits to foreign inspectors. The assertions by the leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , could be tactical, intended to give both the negotiators and himself some political space to get Iran’s hard-liners accustomed to the framework of the nuclear deal reached a week ago with the United States and other world powers. But they sharply illustrated the difficult hurdles that lie ahead as Secretary of State John Kerry and a large team of diplomats, energy experts and intelligence officials try to reach a June 30 deadline that would ensure that Iran could not race for a bomb for at least a decade — and would establish a permanent inspection regime to catch any cheating. In his remarks, Ayatollah Khamenei added several stinging criticisms of Iran’s regional competitor, Saudi Arabia — calling its new leaders “inexperienced youths” — a sign of rising regional tensions that could pose another threat to the negotiations, even as diplomats strive to keep the issues on separate tracks. King Salman, the country’s newly installed leader, is 79, though many around him are a generation younger. Saudi Arabia is currently allied with the United States against Iran in the developing civil war in Yemen, which is fast becoming a major source of regional instability. Mr. Kerry accused Tehran this week of direct military support to the rebels there and warned Tehran to back off. Ayatollah Khamenei’s comments were the first time he has discussed the framework that emerged from the nuclear talks last week in Lausanne, Switzerland. His pronouncements are considered vital because they shape the “red lines” for Iranian negotiators, though they have often showed considerable flexibility in working out details that seem to adhere to his literal meaning while still accommodating some Western demands. For example, he had previously required that no nuclear facilities could be closed, but under the framework accord one of them — Fordo, a deep underground enrichment site — is being converted to a research center where fissile material is banned. Another, a heavy-water reactor, is being redesigned to prevent it from making bomb-grade plutonium. On Tuesday night the director of the C.I.A., John O. Brennan, said he believed Ayatollah Khamenei had been persuaded, over the past two years, that an accord was necessary to avoid an economic free fall in Iran. But the ayatollah himself said Thursday that he saw no need to make a clear pronouncement on the deal because no signed agreement yet existed. But he emphasized his longstanding position about the sanctions, saying that they “should be lifted all together on the same day of the agreement, not six months or one year later.” The Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, who spoke at a different event on Thursday, echoed the supreme leader’s remarks but with a potentially crucial difference, saying the sanctions have to be lifted on the day a deal is put in place, potentially months after a signed agreement. “We will not sign any agreement unless all economic sanctions are totally lifted on the first day of the implementation of the deal,” Mr. Rouhani said during a ceremony for Iran’s nuclear technology day, which celebrates the country’s nuclear achievements. While the June 30 deadline is still months away, the ayatollah’s comments pose some significant potential challenges to Mr. Kerry and his negotiating team. Mr. Kerry and President Obama have been saying that sanctions would be suspended in phases, as Iran complied with its obligations. That is critical to American leverage in making sure that Iran follows through on its commitments to vastly reduce its uranium stockpile — a process that will take months, if not longer — and decommissions centrifuges, placing them in storage. On Wednesday night, on the “PBS NewsHour,” Mr. Kerry said that in any final agreement, Iran would also have to resolve outstanding questions with the International Atomic Energy Agency over suspected military dimensions of the nuclear program . “It will be part of a final agreement,” he said. “It has to be.” American and Iranian officials are using different words to describe elements of the preliminary agreement to limit Iran’s nuclear program. Mr. Kerry’s assurances did little to mollify the deal’s many congressional critics, who pounced on Ayatollah Khamenei’s comments as proof that the nuclear deal is unworkable. “As each new day reveals a new disagreement, it’s increasingly clear that Iran, in fact, failed to reach agreement with the United States and its partners on a political framework that addresses all parameters of a comprehensive agreement,” said Senator Mark Kirk, Republican of Illinois. who has led an effort to impose new sanctions on Iran — a step President Obama says is clearly intended to blow up any progress that has been made. In his remarks Thursday, Ayatollah Khamenei seemed to rule out any inspections inside military bases or compounds. That could become problematic. While Mr. Obama and Mr. Kerry have said the inspection requirements they have negotiated would be among the most intrusive in history, they have not said whether they would extend to military sites. Several of the sites the United States is most concerned about in Iran are on military bases, including Fordo. Inspectors have visited the site regularly, and the atomic energy agency has, periodically, been allowed onto other military bases. Similarly, the timing of sanctions relief is far more complicated than simply setting a date. Even with cooperation from the Iranian side, the technical issues are so complex that agency officials say resolving them will be a lengthy process. As Iran and world powers including the United States try to reach a deal on nuclear controls in exchange for the lifting of sanctions, Iranians from all walks of life are watching and hoping for a new start. Mr. Obama can suspend some of the United States sanctions with the stroke of a pen, but actually terminating them would require congressional action. Other sanctions are based on United Nations Security Council resolutions. Mr. Kerry said in Lausanne last week that under a final deal, if one is reached, a new set of resolutions would be passed, ending many of the sanctions but keeping proliferation controls in place. Even if sanctions are legally eliminated, major corporate players may initially be reluctant to do business in Iran. Banks have been heavily fined for violations and would want assurances about the new rules. Investors may fear that sanctions could “snap back” if there was a dispute between Iran and the West, leaving their investments stranded. Ayatollah Khamenei may have thrown another new factor into the equation by suggesting there was plenty of time to consider a deal and review the actions of opponents, and said the deadline of June 30 was in no way sacred. “They might say that we have only three months left. Well, if three months becomes four months the sky won’t come falling down,” he said. “Just as the other side pushed the negotiations back by seven months,” he added, referring to an extension decided in November. A guide to help you navigate the deal between global powers and Tehran. However, June 30 is the date at which the current extension of negotiations runs out. So unless it is renewed — something both sides have previously rejected — the temporary limits on Iran’s enrichment activities will terminate that day. And after June 30, Congress has threatened to impose new sanctions if a satisfactory deal is not in place. Ayatollah Khamenei did not criticize those details of the framework that had already been agreed to, even though some of them, if put in place, would represent big compromises from all parties, including Iran. He repeated that while he was not optimistic about negotiating with world powers — especially with the United States — he did support the talks and Iran’s diplomatic team. “I have agreed to this particular instance of negotiations and I support the negotiators,” Ayatollah Khamenei said, according to his official website, Khamenei.ir . In recent days, almost all major figures in the Iranian establishment have come out in support of the framework agreement , while adding the usual caveat that Iran’s rights must be guaranteed. Most, including Friday Prayer leaders and military commanders, have said they supported the talks. Yet, speaking to an audience of religious chanters in his Tehran office, the ayatollah said the government should allow critics of the deal to speak their minds, “as it will help unity” in the country. It must be clear, the ayatollah said, that the negotiations were not going beyond the nuclear field. “But,” he continued, “if the other side refrains from its normal bad actions, this will become an experience that we can continue on other issues. If we see that once again they repeat their bad actions, it will only strengthen our experience of not trusting America.” With the ayatollah’s unusually strong remarks about the Saudis on Thursday, the sectarian-tinged fighting in Yemen seemed potentially to be developing into yet another wedge between Washington and Tehran.

                                            Please read the rules before joining the discussion. The Mueller report will not change political opinions of President Donald Trump. Democrats will continue to hate the president and Republicans will continue to think Trump got a raw deal because two years of his presidency were inhibited by an investigation that turned up no collusion. Special counsel Robert Mueller will get plaudits for uncovering the depths of the Russian meddling but will have to answer questions about why he didn’t move to compel Trump to testify. Ultimately, most Americans will conclude that the best way to sort this out is through an election. Trump faces the voters in 2020 and they will have all of this information to consider as they make their decision. Whether Democrats impatient for an early end to the Trump presidency force impeachment remains to be seen. There will be legal analysis ad nauseum about obstruction, but here are five political takeaways that jumped out to me: 1.The extent of the Obama administration’s failure on Russia is breathtaking. The Mueller report flatly states that Russian interference efforts began in 2014, continued in 2015 and blossomed into a full-blown effort to meddle in the 2016 presidential election. The report found no evidence that the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia on election meddling, but substantial confirmation that the previous commander-in-chief failed to stop a hostile foreign power from invading our democracy. Why? Obama’s top priority was getting Russia into the Iranian nuclear deal , which explains why his administration turned a blind eye toward Russian electoral interference. Russian meddling is a mess of Obama’s making, and Trump should order immediate steps to use the Mueller report as a roadmap for stopping them in the future. When you consider that Obama failed to prosecute Julian Assange after his 2010 attack on America, and that he then went on to help Russia meddle in the 2016 election, Obama just looks horrible on this entire ordeal. Special counsel Robert Mueller's redacted report  (Photo: Jon Elswick/AP) 2. Democrats have two options — impeach the president or win an election. With their hopes dashed that Mueller would kick in the White House door and frog march the president to jail, Democratic remedies for getting rid of Trump are purely political: impeach the president for obstruction of justice, or work as hard as possible to win the next election. The House Democratic leadership was having trouble tamping down impeachment talk before, and it won’t get any easier now given the relentless focus on the obstruction section of the report. The bloodthirsty among them will grow even thirstier and calls for impeachment are likely to increase. Can Speaker Nancy Pelosi stop them? I have my doubts that she can herd her impeachment cats away from their hyper-partisan impulses. Further, Democrats must think hard about their future investigatory paths and how it affects their collective credibility in 2020. There will be skepticism among the voting public for any Democratic investigation in the future because their promises of collusion turned out to be false. 3. Mueller must speak. Attorney General William Barr said he had no objection to the special counsel appearing before Congress, and he should do so. It would be a shame, however, if most of his time is focused on Trump and not on helping the federal government prevent Russia election interference in the future. He has done a terrific job uncovering the depth of the interference, including indicting the Russians responsible. Given that they are unlikely to ever see the inside of a U.S. courtroom, Mueller’s legacy should be to create the framework for inoculation against future Russian shenanigans. 4. Congressman Adam Schiff really hurt Democrats by raising the bar on collusion. For two years, Schiff and other Democrats in Congress repeatedly claimed there was evidence of collusion. Time and again, Schiff said he had “ direct ” evidence of Russian collusion and, since Barr’s initial summary letter, has yet to back down. In fact, Schiff has doubled down on his claims, going even further out on a limb that Mueller sawed off today. Politically, Schiff blew up a balloon for the Democrats that Mueller popped. Loudly. Keeping quiet or at least making more measured statements would have kept the egg of the collective face of the Democratic Party. Schiff failed as a Democrat and as a leader on the House Intelligence Committee . He should step down as Chairman immediately, as he clearly was more interested in politically damaging Trump than getting to the truth. Democrats would be better served as a party if he resigned from Congress and went away altogether. 5. Bottom line for Trump — no collusion. The report flatly states, just as Barr said it would, that “the evidence we obtained did not establish that the president was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference.” This has been the central question of the Trump presidency, and Mueller has closed the door on what would have been treason. The president is within his rights to attack the Democrats and media who have promised their partisan audiences something that just didn’t happen. I expect little movement in the president’s approval ratings in the aftermath of this report, and unless Democrats move on impeachment this report will be a distant memory come the fall of 2020, when he faces reelection.

"Mr. President, Decertify the Iran Deal and Then Walk Away","National Review  DOD: Iranian Threats ‘Put on Hold’ Thanks to U.S.   Time Flies: Johnny Walker Lindh, the ‘American Taliban,’ Is Scheduled to Be Released This Week   Crenshaw: Navy SEAL Should Face War-Crimes Trial Before Trump Considers Pardon   The U.S. Is Outplaying Iran in a Regional Chess Match   On Iran and Accepting Risk   The Warmonger Canard   Combating the Chinese-Telecom Threat   A Debate about War Where One Side Hasn’t Shown up Yet   The Many Downsides of War with Iran   Countering Foreign Disinformation on Social Media   Will Anyone Explain America’s Conflict with Iran?

Of course he should. Indeed, he must: Even if we set common sense to the side, federal law requires it.  Instead, there are two questions.   Advertisement    if ( "undefined" !== typeof googletag && ! window.nr_is_logged_in ) {
							googletag.cmd.push( function() { googletag.display("div-gpt-ad-native_mobile"); } );
						}       1. Why has President Trump recertified the deal, not once but twice?  This is shameful. Remember, Trump insisted throughout the 2016 campaign that the deal — formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) — was the worst and most dangerous in the history of deals. Just two weeks ago, addressing the U.N. General Assembly, he described it as an “embarrassment” and “one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into.” Yet, under the statute that calls for presidential findings every 90 days, the president, in recertifying, represented to Congress and the American people (a) that Iran is “transparently, verifiably, and fully implementing the agreement” and (b) that continuing the JCPOA is “vital to the national security interests of the United States.”  These assertions insult the intelligence.  The U.N.’s International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is charged with what laughably passes for the “monitoring” of the JCPOA and related “side agreements,” which the Obama administration shielded from congressional inspection. Last week, the IAEA fessed up: The agency has been unable to verify that Tehran is implementing the deal. The regime has barred inspectors from inspecting military sites. Consequently, as the invaluable analyst Omri Ceren points out , the IAEA has no way of verifying that Iran has refrained from “activities which could contribute to the design and development of a nuclear explosive device” (as required by the JCPOA’s Annex 1, Section T — see here , at p. 27).   Advertisement    if ( "undefined" !== typeof googletag && ! window.nr_is_logged_in ) {
							googletag.cmd.push( function() { googletag.display("div-gpt-ad-inline_2_mobile"); } );
						}      This admission is not news. It just makes the obvious — the inevitable — explicit. It has been widely known from the first that the JCPOA is not verifiable, despite the Obama administration’s guarantees that it would be. It has long been known, moreover, that Iran is not in compliance with many of the JCPOA’s terms. That, too, illustrates the duplicity by which Obama sought his foreign-policy legacy monument: To get the deal approved by Congress — or, at least, to get it not disapproved under the cockamamie Corker-Cardin legislation — the prior administration solemnly pledged to hold the mullahs to the letter (and, of course, that this could be done verifiably). Obama officials further vowed that sanctions would “snap back” if Iran failed to comply. Once the deal got its congressional stamp of non-disapproval, though, we learned that Obama was quietly waiving violations left and right, and had even agreed to limits on what the IAEA could report — the better to conceal Iran’s breaches.   Advertisement    if ( "undefined" !== typeof googletag && ! window.nr_is_logged_in ) {
							googletag.cmd.push( function() { googletag.display("div-gpt-ad-inline_3_mobile"); } );
						}      Bottom line: Iran has never, not for a moment, been “transparently, verifiably, and fully implementing” the JCPOA. The Obama administration knew this all along — and knew it would go this way. The Trump State Department, which is chockablock with Obama holdovers and has heavily lobbied the new president to stand by the deal, has known it from Day One.  And what about that second representation: vital to the national-security interests of the United States?  Seriously? With a straight face?  Quite apart from violating the terms of the JCPOA and refusing to permit verifiable inspections from the start, Iran continues to be the world’s No. 1 sponsor of anti-American terrorism, backing Hezbollah, Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the Taliban, a network of Iraqi cells, and the Houthis in Yemen, to cite just the best-known examples. That’s not just me talking; the regime continues to be one of just three countries on the U.S. government’s official terrorist list (the others are Syria, which is Iran’s cat’s-paw, and Sudan, which has longstanding ties to the regime in Tehran). Iran continues to be the world’s No. 1 sponsor of anti-American terrorism.   Advertisement    if ( "undefined" !== typeof googletag && ! window.nr_is_logged_in ) {
							googletag.cmd.push( function() { googletag.display("div-gpt-ad-inline_4_mobile"); } );
						}      Moreover, Iran maintains its aggressive program of ballistic-missile development in defiance of Security Council resolutions. In fact, less than three months ago, Trump imposed new sanctions on regime officials and abettors. Iran is exporting arms and personnel to fortify Assad’s barbarism in Syria. It continues to threaten Israel’s destruction — in fact, two of the ballistic missiles it has test-fired were inscribed in Hebrew “ Israel must be wiped out .” The mullahs are substantially responsible for the massive Hezbollah build-up (including an arsenal estimated at well over 100,000 missiles ) that raises the distinct possibility of a catastrophic war. And, still proud to be the “Death to America” regime, Iran continues to abduct American hostages and menace American naval vessels.   Advertisement    if ( "undefined" !== typeof googletag && ! window.nr_is_logged_in ) {
							googletag.cmd.push( function() { googletag.display("div-gpt-ad-inline_2"); } );
						}      Now, as you take all that in, understand: The tens of billions of dollars’ worth of sanctions relief Tehran has gotten under the JCPOA, including pallets stacked with billions in ransom cash that Obama threw in for good measure, are helping to pay for all of this anti-American malignity. Yet, we are told — multiple times — that maintaining this arrangement is somehow in the vital national-security interests of the United States.   Advertisement    if ( "undefined" !== typeof googletag && ! window.nr_is_logged_in ) {
							googletag.cmd.push( function() { googletag.display("div-gpt-ad-inline_5_mobile"); } );
						}      On what planet?   2. What should Trump do after (finally) decertifying?  It is time to walk away.  As our former colleague Eliana Johnson reports at Politico , a scheme is afoot in the Trump administration to decertify the Iran deal without killing it. The idea is that the administration would keep the deal alive rather than push Congress to reinstate the sanctions, while endeavoring to persuade Iran and the other parties to the deal to renegotiate it.  This is a terrible plan.  To begin with, how much more betrayal are we supposed to endure? The Obama administration started down this path assuring the nation that Iran would be prevented from acquiring nuclear weapons. Obama then struck a deal that, by its own terms (i.e., even if there were no cheating), merely delayed Iran while paving its way to the acquisition of nuclear weapons. Obama officials promised exacting verification protocols and then made an agreement in which Iran’s performance of its obligations could not be verified. Obama officials promised full disclosure but withheld key portions of the deal, then conspired with Iran to conceal its lack of compliance — even as Iran continued its anti-American provocations.   Advertisement    if ( "undefined" !== typeof googletag && ! window.nr_is_logged_in ) {
							googletag.cmd.push( function() { googletag.display("div-gpt-ad-inline_6_mobile"); } );
						}      We were encouraged to swallow hard and accept all of this on the assurance that the sanctions could and would be “snapped back” into place if the deal failed to change Iran’s behavior. Now, with Iran’s behavior as appalling as ever, Trump — the guy who campaigned on what a lousy deal it is — reportedly has cold feet about snapping back the sanctions.  The rationalization for keeping the JCPOA is that Iran has already gotten most of the deal’s goodies. Abandoning the deal now would hurt us more than the mullahs, the thinking goes, because it would relieve them of the deal’s burdens.  That’s preposterous. Under the terms of the JCPOA and its undisclosed side deals, we do not and cannot know whether Iran is performing its obligations. More significantly, even if we could verify and even if Iran were in compliance, the deal does not prevent Iran from acquiring nukes; it just slows the mullahs down for a few more years.  Plainly, then, the deal is not in American interests. “But wait,” the decertify-but-don’t-kill-it crowd argues, “we will make it in our interests by improving it.”  Nonsense. If you keep the JCPOA, you have to try to fix it within the framework of the JCPOA . . . under circumstances in which Iran insists it will not renegotiate and our “partner” nations — who now have lucrative financial intercourse with Tehran — will balk. In other words, you would already be negotiating in order to try to preserve something that should never have been agreed to in the first place — and from there, you’d have to plead for accommodations.  It is better to walk away. If you keep the JCPOA, you have to try to fix it within the framework of the JCPOA .  What the Iran-deal apologists never mention is that the United States still has enormous leverage in the form of the American economy. Even with the relief Iran has gotten, it is still feeling the pain of being walled off from commerce in U.S. dollars. An aggressive sanctions regimen would punish not only Iran but governments and corporations that do business with Iran. As former Senate staffer Richard Goldberg recounts , this kind of pressure works.  Would there be caterwauling by countries, their heavy-hitter businesses, and even such American companies as Boeing that chase profits in Iran ? Yes, of course. If the Trump administration were serious, though, these calculating players would understand in short order that, if they want access to the $19 trillion U.S. economy, they must shun Iran.  They would shun Iran. And while Iran might not change its behavior, what I am proposing presents the only realistic chance of convincing Iran to change its behavior, especially if we unapologetically pursue other ways to squeeze the regime — as opposed to preserving the JCPOA, which obliges us to be supportive of the regime.   Advertisement    if ( "undefined" !== typeof googletag && ! window.nr_is_logged_in ) {
							googletag.cmd.push( function() { googletag.display("div-gpt-ad-inline_3"); } );
						}      Trump the Businessman has long maintained that the art of the deal is knowing when to walk away from the table — when to take a tack antithetical to Obama’s no-concession-is-too-big approach. It is time to walk away from the table. The JCPOA is an atrocious deal that deserves to die. If the president wants to negotiate, let it be on a new deal and on America’s terms — which, you may remember, are that Iran does not get nuclear weapons, must honor its obligations on weapons development and proliferation, and must cease promoting terrorism.  No other deal is worth having.   — Andrew C. McCarthy is a senior fellow at the National Review Institute and a contributing editor of National Review .

"China is taking charge of a key element in Iran's nuclear deal","createPerformanceMark('first image displayed'); Iran's Ali Akbar Salehi speaks during a meeting in Beijing on Friday. Simon Song Iranian Vice-President Ali Akbar Salehi, who is also head of the country's Atomic Energy Organisation, on Friday said China would play "a leading role" in redesigning the Arak heavy-water reactor to significantly reduce its plutonium output. Selahi's comment, made as he wrapped up his meeting with Chinese nuclear experts and officials in Beijing, again highlighted China's role in the recent nuclear deal reached by Iran and the world powers, as well as the two countries' close cooperation in energy projects. As one of the key elements of the deal on Iran's nuclear programme with the P5+1 group - comprising China, Russia, the United States, Britain, France and Germany - Iran has agreed to redesign the Arak reactor, which is already in its final stage of construction, to reduce its annual plutonium production from 10kg to less than 1kg to "remove the concerns", according to Salehi. "China has accepted … a leading role in a working group that would look into the redesign and refurbishing of Arak. Americans will also participate very seriously," he said. Salehi held meetings with Foreign Minister Wang Yi and China Atomic Energy Authority chairman Xu Dazhe. Under the nuclear deal framework, a trilateral meeting between China, Iran and the US was expected to take place in mid-September on the sidelines of the International Atomic Energy Agency's general conference, despite internal political wrestling between the congress and the administration on the deal within the US , according to Salehi. In this photo released by the Iranian Presidency Office, President Hassan Rouhani, left, speaks as he is accompanied by the head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization Ali Akbar Salehi on a visit to the Bushehr nuclear power plant. AP Photo/Iranian Presidency Office, Mohammad Berno The Iranian vice-president said the country was also seeking Chinese assistance to build two small nuclear reactors with a capacity of 100 megawatts each. The two sides had discussed the issue "at length" and were expected to close deals "in the coming months", he said. China had "indicated readiness" to finance the projects, he added.

REUTERS/Brendan Smialowski/Pool Salehi said Iran would also look into the possibility of building larger nuclear power plants, with capacities of 1,000MW each, as the country aims to build 20,000MW of nuclear power capacity in 30 years. Iran has previously signed agreements with Russia to build two 1,000MW nuclear reactors. With economic sanctions on Iran lifted after the implementation of the nuclear deal, the multibillion-dollar trade relationship between China and Iran is set to expand. China is expected to invest more heavily in Iran's oil, gas and industrial sectors. Foreign Minister Wang was earlier quoted by state-run Xinhua as saying the deal "created more favourable conditions for the development of the China-Iran relationship".","https://www.businessinsider.com/chinas-role-in-iran-nuclear-deal-2015-8"

It so certified to Congress, most recently in July, as required by law. Before the second certification, Trump asked repeatedly for alternatives to acquiescing yet again in a policy he clearly abhorred. But no such options were forthcoming, despite “a sharp series of exchanges” between the president and his advisers, as the New York Times and similar press reports characterized it.

						}       Abrogating the Iran Deal: The Way Forward   I.  Background:  The Trump Administration is required to certify to Congress every 90 days that Iran is complying with the July 2015 nuclear deal (the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action — JCPOA), and that this agreement is in the national-security interest of the United States. 1 While a comprehensive Iranian policy review is currently underway, America’s Iran policy should not be frozen. The JCPOA is a threat to U.S. national-security interests, growing more serious by the day. If the President decides to abrogate the JCPOA, a comprehensive plan must be developed and executed to build domestic and international support for the new policy.   Advertisement    if ( "undefined" !== typeof googletag && ! window.nr_is_logged_in ) {
							googletag.cmd.push( function() { googletag.display("div-gpt-ad-native"); } );
						}      Under the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015, the President must certify every 90 days that:   (i) Iran is transparently, verifiably, and fully implementing the agreement, including all related technical or additional agreements;   (ii) Iran has not committed a material breach with respect to the agreement or, if Iran has committed a material breach, Iran has cured the material breach;   Advertisement    if ( "undefined" !== typeof googletag && ! window.nr_is_logged_in ) {
							googletag.cmd.push( function() { googletag.display("div-gpt-ad-inline_4_mobile"); } );
						}       (iii) Iran has not taken any action, including covert activities, that could significantly advance its nuclear weapons program; and  (iv) Suspension of sanctions related to Iran pursuant to the agreement is –   (I) appropriate and proportionate to the specific and verifiable measures taken by Iran with respect to terminating its illicit nuclear program; and  (II) vital to the national-security interests of the United States.  U.S. leadership here is critical, especially through a diplomatic and public education effort to explain a decision not to certify and to abrogate the JCPOA. Like any global campaign, it must be persuasive, thorough, and accurate. Opponents, particularly those who participated in drafting and implementing the JCPOA, will argue strongly against such a decision, contending that it is reckless, ill-advised, and will have negative economic and security consequences.  Accordingly, we must explain the grave threat to the U.S. and our allies, particularly Israel. The JCPOA’s vague and ambiguous wording; its manifest imbalance in Iran’s direction; Iran’s significant violations; and its continued, indeed, increasingly, unacceptable conduct at the strategic level internationally demonstrate convincingly that the JCPOA is not in the national-security interests of the United States. We can bolster the case for abrogation by providing new, declassified information on Iran’s unacceptable behavior around the world.   Advertisement    if ( "undefined" !== typeof googletag && ! window.nr_is_logged_in ) {
							googletag.cmd.push( function() { googletag.display("div-gpt-ad-inline_5_mobile"); } );
						}      But as with prior Presidential decisions, such as withdrawing from the 1972 ABM Treaty, a new “reality” will be created. We will need to assure the international community that the U.S. decision will in fact enhance international peace and security, unlike the JCPOA, the provisions of which shield Iran’s ongoing efforts to develop deliverable nuclear weapons. The Administration should announce that it is abrogating the JCPOA due to significant Iranian violations, Iran’s unacceptable international conduct more broadly, and because the JCPOA threatens American national-security interests.   Advertisement    if ( "undefined" !== typeof googletag && ! window.nr_is_logged_in ) {
							googletag.cmd.push( function() { googletag.display("div-gpt-ad-inline_2"); } );
						}      The Administration’s explanation in a “white paper” should stress the many dangerous concessions made to reach this deal, such as allowing Iran to continue to enrich uranium; allowing Iran to operate a heavy-water reactor; and allowing Iran to operate and develop advanced centrifuges while the JCPOA is in effect. Utterly inadequate verification and enforcement mechanisms and Iran’s refusal to allow inspections of military sites also provide important reasons for the Administration’s decision.   Advertisement    if ( "undefined" !== typeof googletag && ! window.nr_is_logged_in ) {
							googletag.cmd.push( function() { googletag.display("div-gpt-ad-inline_6_mobile"); } );
						}      Even the previous Administration knew the JCPOA was so disadvantageous to the United States that it feared to submit the agreement for Senate ratification. Moreover, key American allies in the Middle East directly affected by this agreement, especially Israel and the Gulf states, did not have their legitimate interests adequately taken into account. The explanation must also demonstrate the linkage between Iran and North Korea.  We must also highlight Iran’s unacceptable behavior, such as its role as the world’s central banker for international terrorism, including its directions and control over Hezbollah and its actions in Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon. The reasons Ronald Reagan named Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism in 1984 remain fully applicable today.   II.  Campaign Plan Components  There are four basic elements to the development and implementation of the campaign plan to decertify and abrogate the Iran nuclear deal:   1. Early, quiet consultations with key players such as the U.K., France, Germany,  Israel, and Saudi Arabia, to tell them we are going to abrogate the deal based on outright violations and other unacceptable Iranian behavior, and seek their input.   2. Prepare the documented strategic case for withdrawal through a detailed white  paper (including declassified intelligence as appropriate) explaining why the deal is harmful to U.S. national interests, how Iran has violated it, and why Iran’s behavior more broadly has only worsened since the deal was agreed.   3. A greatly expanded diplomatic campaign should immediately follow the  announcement, especially in Europe and the Middle East, and we should ensure continued emphasis on the Iran threat as a top diplomatic and strategic priority.   4. Develop and execute Congressional and public diplomacy efforts to build  domestic and foreign support.   III. Execution Concepts and Tactics   1. Early, quiet consultations with key players  It is critical that a worldwide effort be initiated to inform our allies, partners, and others about Iran’s unacceptable behavior. While this effort could well leak to the press, it is nonetheless critical that we inform and consult with our allies and partners at the earliest possible moment, and, where appropriate, build into our effort their concerns and suggestions.  This quiet effort will articulate the nature and details of the violations and the type of relationship the U.S. foresees in the future, thereby laying the foundation for imposing new sanctions barring the transfer of nuclear and missile technology or dual use technology to Iran. With Israel and selected others, we will discuss military options. With others in the Gulf region, we can also discuss means to address their concerns from Iran’s menacing behavior.  The advance consultations could begin with private calls by the President, followed by more extensive discussions in capitals by senior Administration envoys. Promptly elaborating a comprehensive tactical diplomatic plan should be a high priority.   2. Prepare the documented strategic case  The White House, coordinating all other relevant Federal agencies, must forcefully articulate the strong case regarding U.S. national-security interests. The effort should produce a “white paper” that will be the starting point for the diplomatic and domestic discussion of the Administration decision to abrogate the JCPOA, and why Iran must be denied access to nuclear technology indefinitely. The white paper should be an unclassified, written statement of the Administration’s case, prepared faultlessly, with scrupulous attention to accuracy and candor. It should not be limited to the inadequacies of the JCPOA as written, or Iran’s violations, but cover the entire range of Iran’s continuing unacceptable international behavior.  Although the white paper will not be issued until the announcement of the decision to abrogate the JCPOA, initiating work on drafting the document is the highest priority, and its completion will dictate the timing of the abrogation announcement.  A thorough review and declassification strategy, including both U.S. and foreign intelligence in our possession should be initiated to ensure that the public has as much information as possible about Iranian behavior that is currently classified, consistent with protecting intelligence sources and methods. We should be prepared to “name names” and expose the underbelly of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard business activities and how they are central to the efforts that undermine American and allied national interests. In particular, we should consider declassifying information related to activities such as the Iran-North Korea partnership, and how they undermine fundamental interests of our allies and partners.   Advertisement    if ( "undefined" !== typeof googletag && ! window.nr_is_logged_in ) {
							googletag.cmd.push( function() { googletag.display("div-gpt-ad-inline_3"); } );
						}       3. Greatly expanded diplomatic campaign post-announcement  The Administration, through the NSC process, should develop a tactical plan that uses all available diplomatic tools to build support for our decision, including what actions we recommend other countries to take. But America must provide the leadership. It will take substantial time and effort and will require a “full court press” by U.S. embassies worldwide and officials in Washington to drive the process forward. We should ensure that U.S. officials fully understand the decision, and its finality, to help ensure the most positive impact with their interlocutors.  Our embassies worldwide should demarche their host governments with talking points (tailored as may be necessary) and data to explain and justify abrogating JCPOA. We will need parallel efforts at the United Nations and other appropriate multilateral organizations. Our embassies should not limit themselves to delivering the demarche, however, but should undertake extensive public diplomacy as well.  After explaining and justifying the decision to abrogate the deal, the next objective should be to recreate a new counter-proliferation coalition to replace the one squandered by the previous Administration, including our European allies, Israel, and the Gulf states. In that regard, we should solicit suggestions for imposing new sanctions on Iran and other measures in response to its nuclear and ballistic-missile programs, sponsorship of terrorism, and generally belligerent behavior, including its meddling in Iraq and Syria.  Russia and China obviously warrant careful attention in the post-announcement campaign. They could be informed just prior to the public announcement as a courtesy, but should not be part of the pre-announcement diplomatic effort described above. We should welcome their full engagement to eliminate these threats, but we will move ahead with or without them.  Iran is not likely to seek further negotiations once the JCPOA is abrogated, but the Administration may wish to consider rhetorically leaving that possibility open in order to demonstrate Iran’s actual underlying intention to develop deliverable nuclear weapons, an intention that has never flagged.  In preparation for the diplomatic campaign, the NSC interagency process should review U.S. foreign-assistance programs as they might assist our efforts. The DNI should prepare a comprehensive, worldwide list of companies and activities that aid Iran’s terrorist activities.   4. Develop and execute Congressional and public diplomacy efforts  The Administration should have a Capitol Hill plan to inform members of Congress already concerned about Iran, and develop momentum for imposing broad sanctions against Iran, far more comprehensive than the pinprick sanctions favored under prior Administrations. Strong congressional support will be critical. We should be prepared to link Iranian behavior around the world, including its relationship with North Korea, and its terrorist activities. And we should demonstrate the linkage between Iranian behavior and missile proliferation as part of the overall effort that justifies a national-security determination that U.S. interests would not be furthered with the JCPOA.  Unilateral U.S. sanctions should be imposed outside the framework of Security Council Resolution 2231 so that Iran’s defenders cannot water them down; multilateral sanctions from others who support us can follow quickly.  The Administration should also encourage discussions in Congress and in public debate for further steps that might be taken to go beyond the abrogation decision. These further steps, advanced for discussion purposes and to stimulate debate, should collectively demonstrate our resolve to limit Iran’s malicious activities and global adventurism. Some would relate directly to Iran; others would protect our allies and partners more broadly from the nuclear proliferation and terrorist threats, such as providing F-35s to Israel or THAAD resources to Japan. Other actions could include:  &dash; End all landing and docking rights for all Iranian aircraft and ships at key allied ports;  &dash; End all visas for Iranians, including so called “scholarly,” student, sports, or other exchanges;  &dash; Demand payment with a set deadline on outstanding U.S. federal-court judgments against Iran for terrorism, including 9/11;  &dash; Announce U.S. support for the democratic Iranian opposition;  &dash; Expedite delivery of bunker-buster bombs;  &dash; Announce U.S. support for Kurdish national aspirations, including Kurds in Iran, Iraq, and Syria;  &dash; Provide assistance to Balochis, Khuzestan Arabs, Kurds, and others — also to internal resistance among labor unions, students, and women’s groups;  &dash; Actively organize opposition to Iranian political objectives in the U.N.

						}       IV.  Conclusion  This effort should be the Administration’s highest diplomatic priority, commanding all necessary time, attention, and resources. We can no longer wait to eliminate the threat posed by Iran. The Administration’s justification of its decision will demonstrate to the world that we understand the threat to our civilization; we must act and encourage others to meet their responsibilities as well.     1  Although this paper will refer to “the JCPOA,” the abrogation decision should also encompass the July 14, 2015, statement by the Security Council’s five permanent members and Germany, attached as Annex B to Security Council Resolution 2231. The JCPOA is attached as Annex A to Resolution 2231.

"Trump’s decision to blow up the Iran deal is a massive attack on Europe","Few ideas are as holy in President Trump’s international liturgy as the concept of national sovereignty. His National Security Strategy speaks of a “beautiful vision—a world of strong, sovereign, and independent nations,” and the Trump himself is keen to repeat some form of “sovereignty” as often as he can. Sovereignty to Trump seems to mean that the United States can do whatever it wants without taking the interests of others into account. It’s the ultimate embodiment of “America first.” In reality, other actors have the right to their sovereignty, which is what the National Security Strategy proudly proclaims. But Trump’s decision to try to blow up the nuclear deal with Iran is, in its execution, nothing less than a massive assault on the sovereignty of others — most notably that of Europe. The president has now directed maximum economic sanctions to be applied. But with few exceptions (Boeing is the one of significance), these sanctions don’t really affect American business or activities. They have already, in one way or the other, been blocked from business with Iran. Instead, the brunt of the sanctions offensive directly affects business in Europe . For instance, in a tweet, the new U.S. ambassador to Germany was quick to give orders to German companies on how they should behave. This is nothing less than a massive assault on the sovereignty of European states and the European Union. They are deprived of their right to decide on their policies and actions by brutal dictates from a foreign — and allegedly friendly — country. This is utterly unacceptable from a European point of view, as well as a violation of the preaching of Trump himself. It relegates Europe to just abiding by and implementing policies with which it profoundly disagrees. We have been here before. Once upon a time, the United States tried to enforce so-called secondary sanctions on European companies doing business with Cuba, among others. But the E.U. reacted by using blocking regulation, prohibiting companies from following dictates from the United States. Eventually, a face-saving solution to the dispute was found, and the United States had to back down. European economies can certainly survive without trade with Iran, but European sovereignty in foreign affairs can hardly survive passive compliance with the new dictates from the White House. Compliance would mean few would trust the E.U. as a sovereign actor in foreign and security policies. I guess few tears would be shed in the White House if that were to happen. Key people there are known to despise the efforts of European states to try to work together within the E.U. framework. Beyond the deep disagreements on policies relating to climate, trade and Iran, it would be most unwise to underestimate the long-term damage to the transatlantic relationship caused by Washington’s assault on Europe. Strong voices are now demanding that Europe stand up for its sovereignty by being more confrontational with Trump. It’s tricky, and unlikely to be completely successful, but possible. I certainly disagree with Trump’s policies on the Iran nuclear agreement, but I’m even more opposed to his assault on Europe’s sovereignty.

"John Bolton Is a National Security Threat","Shadow Government:  John Bolton Is a National Security Threat  John Bolton Is a National Securit...  Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster is out as Trump’s national security advisor, and former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations (and current Fox News contributor) John Bolton is in. This is no mere rotation of on-screen personalities in the latest episode of “The Trump Show.” It is a move with potentially profound implications for the direction of U.S. foreign policy. Indeed, Bolton’s ascendance increases the risk of not one but two wars — with North Korea and Iran. McMaster was no dove. But Bolton falls into an entirely different category of dangerous uber-hawk. Fifteen years ago, Bolton championed the Iraq War, and, to this day, he continues to believe the most disastrous foreign-policy decision in a generation was a good idea. Bolton’s position on Iraq was no anomaly. Shortly before the 2003 invasion, he reportedly told Israeli officials that once Saddam Hussein was deposed, it would be necessary to deal with Syria, Iran, and North Korea. He has essentially maintained this position ever since. Put plainly: For Bolton, there are few international problems where war is not the answer. As the nuclear crisis with North Korea enters a critical period, Trump’s choice of Bolton as national security advisor dims the prospect of reaching a peaceful solution. Bolton, like McMaster, sees Kim Jong Un as fundamentally irrational and undeterrable — a view that seems to justify launching a preventive war if North Korea refuses to denuclearize. But McMaster supported diplomacy and, as a military man with extensive combat experience, understood the costs of war. Bolton, on the other hand, has spent his entire career sabotaging diplomacy with Pyongyang and seems downright giddy about a possible military confrontation. A little history is helpful here. Bolton was undersecretary of state for arms control and international security when President George W. Bush’s administration made the fateful decision in 2002 to kill the 1994 Agreed Framework with North Korea. The Bill Clinton-era accord froze North Korea’s plutonium program under effective verification. But when it was discovered that Pyongyang was pursuing a separate uranium enrichment program with the help of Pakistan, a key decision had to be made: re-engage in diplomacy to expand the agreement to prohibit uranium enrichment or tear it up, isolate a member of the “Axis of Evil,” and push for regime change. Bush, guided in part by Bolton, chose the latter approach. And once the Agreed Framework collapsed, North Korea took the secured plutonium under its control and built about half a dozen additional nuclear weapons, testing its first in 2006. For many arms control and nonproliferation experts, this case represents a cautionary tale about the risks of foreclosing diplomatic engagement. In Bolton’s mind, however, North Korea’s actions simply prove that diplomacy doesn’t work with rogue states and that the only solution is to end these regimes all together, through U.S. military might if necessary. More than a decade later, Bolton continues to cling to this dark worldview. In a Sept. 3, 2017, Fox News interview , Bolton declared that the only option left to address the North Korean nuclear challenge is “to end the regime in North Korea” and strike first. “Anybody who thinks that more diplomacy with North Korea, more sanctions, whether against North Korea or an effort to apply sanctions against China, is just giving North Korea more time to increase its nuclear arsenal,” Bolton warned. “We have fooled around with North Korea for 25 years, and fooling around some more is just going to make matters worse.” In an echo of the rationale that drove the United States to topple Saddam’s regime, Bolton painted an apocalyptic picture of the gathering danger posed by Kim’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs. The North Koreans “are very close to being able to hit targets all across the United States … with thermonuclear weapons,” Bolton said. “Moreover, this regime will sell anything to anybody for hard currency. They could sell these weapons, ballistic missiles and the nuclear devices themselves, to Iran in a heartbeat.… The metaphor of the Axis of Evil is not really a metaphor — it is a reality. North Korea can sell these devices to terrorist groups around the world. They can be used as electromagnetic pulse weapons … destroying our electrical grid’s capabilities. They can be used for nuclear blackmail.” If we fail to act, “it would be a lesson to every would-be nuclear state in the world that if you just have patience enough, you can wear the United States down.” Instead, “we should heed Franklin Roosevelt’s advice.… When you see a rattlesnake poised to strike, you don’t wait until it has struck before you crush it.… I would argue that today North Korean nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, and Iran’s while we’re on the subject, are the rattlesnakes of the 21st century.” To further lay the groundwork for taking military action, Bolton penned an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal just last month titled “The Legal Case for Striking North Korea First.” Recalling the Bush administration’s flawed analysis in the run-up to the Iraq War, Bolton argued that “the threat is imminent” and that the United States has every right to take launch a preventive war before it is too late. On March 8, Trump shocked the world by agreeing to meet with Kim sometime before the end of May. The president’s decision represents a high-stakes gamble that could produce a diplomatic breakthrough — or send the United States and North Korea careening toward a war that could kill hundreds of thousands of people. Reports suggest that the timing of Trump’s move to replace McMaster with Bolton, as well as the president’s earlier decision to fire Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and replace him with Mike Pompeo, is an effort to put key personnel aligned with his views in place leading into the summit. Yet if Bolton reflects, or influences, Trump’s position on North Korea, the entire endeavor is doomed. Indeed, Bolton reacted to news of the summit by dismissing any prospect for success and rooting for a quick failure so the United States can move on to other options. According to Bolton, the only value in having this “unproductive” leader-to-leader meeting now, instead of starting with a more deliberate set of working-level talks, is to “foreshorten the amount of time that we’re going to waste in negotiations that will never produce the result we want, which is Kim giving up his nuclear program.” Bolton’s doomsaying views are not reserved for North Korea alone; he is equally likely to encourage Trump to chart a path toward military confrontation with Iran. McMaster was no fan of Iran. As an Iraq War veteran who lost troops to Iranian-made rockets and roadside bombs, he favored a muscular policy to push back against the Islamic Republic’s regional ambitions. But McMaster did not favor ditching the 2015 Iran nuclear deal (officially, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA) because he understood that doing so would isolate Washington, not Tehran, and make it even harder to contain Iran’s other destabilizing behavior. Not so with Bolton. Over the past two years, inspectors with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have filed nine consecutive reports showing that Iran is living up to its commitments to constrain its nuclear program in accordance with the JCPOA. Yet Bolton claims , “I don’t think the evidence is there that this agreement is slowing them down.” Bolton has also repeatedly asserted, without any actual evidence, that Iran is on the cusp of acquiring off-the-shelf nuclear weapons from North Korea. “If Tehran’s long collusion with Pyongyang on ballistic missiles is even partly mirrored in the nuclear field,” he wrote last year in the Wall Street Journal , “the Iranian threat is nearly as imminent as North Korea’s. Whatever the extent of their collaboration thus far, Iran could undoubtedly use its now-unfrozen assets and cash from oil-investment deals to buy nuclear hardware from North Korea, one of the world’s poorest nations.” Moreover, for Bolton, actual Iranian compliance with the JCPOA seems beside the point. As he wrote on Twitter in January: “There’s been far too much debate over whether ‪#Iran is in violation of the ‪#NuclearDeal. The point is that this was a bad deal to begin with and it’s a bad deal now and it should be torn up.” As is the case with North Korea, Bolton’s appointment comes at an incredibly sensitive time for the Iran nuclear deal. In fact, the fate of the JCPOA will likely be decided in May — the same month as the proposed Trump-Kim summit. On Jan. 12, Trump set a 120-day deadline for European allies and Congress to “fix” the agreement, or he would stop waiving U.S. nuclear-related sanctions and withdraw from the deal. McMaster — along with Tillerson and Secretary of Defense James Mattis — repeatedly urged Trump not to trash the JCPOA, searching for a minimally sufficient agreement with Europe and U.S. lawmakers to keep the president in the deal. A State Department team has been working with their counterparts in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom to identify a compromise that would entail additional European commitments to sanction Iran’s ballistic missile program, a reaffirmation of IAEA inspection rights, and a framework to negotiate additional restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program when constraints on uranium enrichment weaken at years 10 and 15 of the JCPOA in exchange for Trump remaining in the accord. Bolton — perhaps with support from fellow Iran hawk Pompeo — is likely to tell the State Department not to bother and encourage the president to reject any arrangement with the Europeans as insufficient. Last August, Bolton wrote a memo to Trump, published in the National Review , dismissing the notion that the JCPOA can or should be fixed, instead outlining a strategy for ripping up the deal. And when asked by Fox Business on Oct. 4, 2017, what advice he would give Trump, Bolton said : “I would urge him to get out of the Iran deal completely.… We shouldn’t try a too-cute-by-half approach [of seeking to improve the deal]. America benefits from strong, clear, decisive leadership. This is a very bad deal for the United States. That’s what the president believes. He should just get out of it.” This month, Gen. Joseph Votel, the top U.S. military officer in the Middle East, said that “the JCPOA addresses one of the principle threats that we deal with from Iran, so if the JCPOA goes away, then we will have to have another way” to address Iran’s nuclear program. There is no doubt what Bolton envisions as the alternative: As he argued in an infamous 2015 New York Times op-ed, and has repeatedly advocated over the years, “to stop Iran’s bomb, bomb Iran” and push for regime change. Bolton has been completely transparent about his game plan here. In October 2017, Bolton outlined the steps he would recommend to the president following a U.S. exit from the nuclear deal: “I think you put more American sanctions on them for their nuclear and ballistic missile program. You investigate more carefully the highly likely level of cooperation with North Korea. We know they’re cooperating on missiles — almost certainly they are on nuclear weapons as well. You go to the Europeans and say, ‘We understand this is going to cause you some difficulty, but you need to join with us.’ And we see what we can do, including talking to Israel about possible military steps.” Unsurprisingly, Bolton’s ultimate goal toward Iran — like it was with Saddam’s Iraq and is with Kim’s North Korea — is regime change. As he argued in yet another Wall Street Journal  piece , “America’s declared policy should be ending Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution before its 40th anniversary.” Bolton’s views on Iraq, North Korea, Iran, and other issues reveal a general pattern of thought: a tendency toward worst-case thinking; a pattern of warping and misusing intelligence to build the case for war with rogue states; a disdain for allies and multilateral institutions ; a blind faith in U.S. military power and the benefits of regime change; and a tendency to see the ends as justifying the means, however horrific. Bolton also has a long and documented history of stifling views that differ from his own and even punishing subordinates who disagree with him. While this style may make him a good fit with Trump, it will compound the ongoing demoralization of the intelligence community, career civil servants, and National Security Council staff and contribute to the further dysfunction of an already broken national security process. McMaster’s departure and Bolton’s appointment represent just the latest sign that Trump is sick of being constrained by the “adults” in the room. Instead, the president seems increasingly inclined to go with his gut and is looking to surround himself with ideological bedfellows and enablers. And, in Bolton, Trump has found a national security advisor who will feed his worst instincts: his uncomfortable relationship with objective facts; his belief that a bullying maximalism is how the United States “leads”; his disdain for real diplomacy; his tendency to value the military instrument above — and to the exclusion of — all others; and his conviction that a toxic work environment and ridicule produce good outcomes. In government, personnel often is policy — and Trump’s latest personnel move is likely to leave the United States and the world less safe. Jon Wolfsthal is director of the Nuclear Crisis Group.

"Divided at the centre: Germany, Poland, and the troubles of the Trump era","Piotr Buras & Josef Janning  @JJ52  19th December, 2018  For most Europeans, it is now obvious that the foreign policy of US President Donald Trump threatens the global liberal order. Trump’s hostility towards multilateral arrangements and his unilateral “America First” policy directly oppose the European Union’s interests and principles in many areas – from the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal to free-trade agreements and the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty. His foreign policy has also sparked debate in Europe on the EU’s defence capabilities and role in the world, including on whether “European sovereignty” can offset the United States’ apparent abandonment of its traditional role as guarantor of the liberal order. Trump’s behaviour is also hitting Europe where it is most vulnerable – unity and cohesion between member states – at a delicate moment. As movements that attack the pro-EU mainstream are becoming increasingly popular in many European countries, Trump’s unilateralism and his emphasis on the nation state as the natural actor in international affairs are strengthening their nationalist narratives. Moreover, Trump’s attacks on Brussels align perfectly with the calls for emancipation from the EU’s supposed dictates from countries such as the United Kingdom, Poland, Hungary, and Greece. The US president’s power to deepen this divide in Europe – which is probably more severe than that created by the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq – should not be underestimated. Nowhere can this be seen more clearly than in the relationship between Germany and Poland. At stake is much more than bilateral relations between two neighbouring countries. In many ways, the Polish-German relationship forms the principal bridge between east and west, connecting two still rather different parts of the EU. Indeed, as the relationship is key to the future of the European project in many respects, the current crisis between Poland and Germany is a problem for the whole bloc. And Trump’s behaviour threatens any attempt to ease tensions between them. This paper analyses the Poland-Germany relationship in the context of their approaches to US foreign policy and, more broadly, their evolving perceptions of America as a global player and a partner of the EU. It pays particularly close attention to the ways in which Polish and German policies on the US have affected their EU defence ambitions and their attitudes towards multilateralism and Russia. Trump’s actions have brought about intense debates, new initiatives, and even important shifts in the foreign policies of Germany and Poland – which often have opposing priorities. While there remains a real possibility of a collapse in their relationship due to increasing mistrust, Berlin and Warsaw continue to have significant shared interests. Beginning in the mid-1990s, Germany was the most influential advocate of Polish accession to the EU and eastern enlargement more broadly. Poland’s interest in protecting its independence by joining the EU and NATO aligned with Germany’s desire to create a relationship with its eastern neighbours that was close as that with those to the west. Since 2004, when Poland and nine other eastern European states joined the EU, Polish-German relations have centred on Poland’s aim to create a “partnership for Europe” with Germany, as well as Berlin’s promise to treat Warsaw and Paris as equally important. [1] Yet, today, the relationship is widely viewed as being weaker than at any time since 1989 – so weak that it hampers efforts to re-energise the European project. This could be seen at the November 2018 celebrations marking the centenary of Polish independence, during which Polish President Andrzej Duda visited Berlin for a two-day conference on Germany’s policy on Poland since 1918. Meant as a symbol of re-engagement and goodwill, the trip ended in disaster. Duda perceived German journalists’ questions about the Polish approach to the rule of law as provocative, while his audience booed his criticism of the EU. Similarly, Poland’s ambassador to Berlin irked his hosts by describing the last 100 years of German policy on Poland as a “single catastrophe”. Made in the presence of German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas, this claim appeared to dismiss the three decades in which Berlin had pursued reconciliation with Warsaw and a constructive neighbourhood policy. Taken together, these two events form a microcosm of the crisis in Polish-German cooperation that began in 2015, when the right-wing, populist Law and Justice Party (PiS) came to power in Poland. In many ways, the crisis stems from the differing trajectories the sides have embarked on in their respective European policies. In his January 2016 speech on Polish foreign policy priorities, then foreign minister Witold Waszczykowski named the UK as Poland’s key diplomatic partner in Europe. In the preceding 25 years, his predecessors had named Germany in this role. While Warsaw’s rhetoric on Berlin has fluctuated during the last three years, mutual mistrust and major policy differences have continued to define their relationship, reflecting a deeper change in their perceptions of the EU. The PiS government has challenged the idea of closer EU cooperation, defended Polish national sovereignty against Brussels and Berlin, and rejected Germany’s role as the key power in the bloc. Disputes between the European Commission and the Polish government over the latter’s alleged violations of the rule of law, the Nord Stream 2 energy pipeline, and migration policy have overshadowed bilateral relations between Poland and Germany. As Warsaw criticised Berlin for its alleged dominance of the EU and demanded reparations for the second world war, German political elites complained about Poland’s refusal to cooperate on migration policy and its apparent lack of interest in improving the bilateral relationship. Germany’s recent leadership in managing European crises has triggered a domestic debate about how to readjust German foreign and security policy to better fulfil this role. For instance, Germany has been instrumental in forging EU unity on Russia sanctions policy, contributed greatly to strengthened NATO deployments in eastern Europe, and, most recently, advanced the debate on European sovereignty in response to dramatic shifts in US foreign policy. As German political scientist Gunther Hellmann put it , “ eine neuartige Erfahrung wird dabei sein, dass sich die Bundesrepublik nicht mehr automatisch auf die institutionellen Fixpunkte NATO und EU oder die Führungsleistungen zentraler Verbündeter wie die USA oder Frankreich verlassen kann, die der deutschen Außen- und Sicherheitspolitik in den vergangenen Jahrzehnten Orientierung und Entlastung lieferten ” (it will be a new experience for Germany to be unable to automatically rely on institutions such as NATO or the EU and the leadership of major allies such as the US or France, which in past decades have provided orientation and relief to German foreign and security policy). While they have yet to determine the direction and scope of the rhetorical and political changes this requires, political elites in Berlin are increasingly aware of the implications of their country’s pivotal position in the EU. Against this background, the 2018 edition of ECFR’s EU Coalition Explorer provides further evidence that the relationship between Poland and Germany has weakened in the last two years. Although the countries are in frequent contact with each other, most German respondents to the survey – comprising policymakers and policy analysts – view Poland and Germany as having few significant shared interests, and perceive Warsaw as relatively unresponsive to Berlin. Polish respondents still see Germany as being among their most important partners, albeit as less important than Hungary. However, German respondents view Poland as having disappointed their government during the last two years – and Polish respondents see Germany the same way. In the German view , Poland is as disappointing as Hungary and the UK. This slump in the Berlin-Warsaw relationship reflects, and is one of the most important causes of, a wider European malaise. Arguably, one cannot solve the problems of uncertain leadership in the EU and the growing east-west divide within the bloc without addressing the Polish-German crisis. Both individually and as partners, Germany and Poland are key to the future of European integration. Whether and how Germany could lead Europe – rather than act as the continent’s hegemon, as it is sometimes perceived – has become more pressing as the bloc stumbles from one crisis to the next. Berlin is likely to see itself as leading from the centre: acting as an honest broker for the various interests of EU member states rather than as an Ideengeber that provides clear guidance and seeks support for its own policy recommendations. It remains to be seen whether this form of leadership will suffice. Nonetheless, Germany can only lead effectively if it has the trust, support, and cooperation of other member states – not least Poland, as its second-largest neighbour, a key economic partner, and the biggest country in central and eastern Europe. Leading from the centre can hardly work if it is seen as merely a cover for Franco-German bilateralism. This is why Berlin perceives the effort to bring Poland back into the fold as crucial to the legitimacy and efficiency of its ideal of European leadership. As its stated goal is to maintain European unity, Germany cannot allow tensions between various parts of the bloc to create permanent political divisions. The country needs the cooperation of central and eastern Europe due to its close economic relationship with the region; its desire to find the right balance between protectionism and economic liberalism within the single market; and its aim to address security threats to Europe’s south and east. While Germany is crucial to maintaining unity within the EU, it is Poland’s political course that will largely determine whether the bloc will become increasingly divided. With Germany intent on preserving the status quo in European integration, the Polish government seems determined to roll back the supranational concept of EU founder Jean Monnet in favour of an intergovernmental construction – “l’Europe des patries” (a Europe of nations), in the words of another French EU founder, Charles de Gaulle. The fact that Polish and German policies are falling out of sync creates, therefore, a serious strategic challenge for not only Germany and Poland but the entire EU. Warsaw’s drift away from the European mainstream not only hampers Berlin’s aspirations to be an honest broker within a unified EU but also threatens the core Polish interest of maintaining a strong union. This is where the crisis of transatlantic relations – sparked by Trump’s behaviour – comes in. The Polish and German governments’ capacity to reconcile their policies on the US will have profound implications for the EU’s ability to pursue an effective independent foreign policy. Berlin and Warsaw have very different ideas about how to respond to the challenge Trump’s presidency poses to Europe. The prevailing German reaction has been to stress the need to defend the multilateral order and strengthen Europe’s resilience – for Maas, the answer to “America First” was to be “Europe United”. In contrast, the Polish response has been to remain calm and embrace the opportunities of the new political reality. Thus, while Germany emphasises European unity, Poland is investing in its bilateral partnership with the US. In some ways, these differences originate in the countries’ diverging analyses of what Trump’s presidency means for Europe and the transatlantic relationship. Interestingly, both the German and Polish narratives contain a large dose of fatalism. Germany’s new approach to America seems to be governed by what political scientist Thomas Kleine-Brockhoff calls “continuity theory”, or the “assumption that the changes in US foreign policy began well before Trump’s election – and will outlast his presidency well into the future”. If, having become overstretched in its global commitments, the US was always likely to dismantle the multilateral order and unilaterally pursue the American interest at any cost, Germany and the EU have to prepare for transatlantic tension (or even confrontation) that outlasts Trump’s radical presidency. Poland’s fatalism about America has an entirely different character. It is anchored in the notion that US security guarantees are indispensable in an increasingly dangerous geopolitical environment. Due to the lack of viable alternatives, Poland has no choice but to bet on continuous American security engagement with central and eastern Europe. To ease their doubts, Polish politicians seek America’s assurances – as seen in their quest to attract additional deployments of US combat forces on Polish soil. Since the stakes are so high, investment in the relationship with the US seems the only approach that can pay off. And, if it fails, the outcome will not be more disastrous than that of any other strategy. These differences may be unsurprising given Berlin’s and Warsaw’s diverging security perceptions, and the dissonance between traditional Polish Atlanticism and the long-standing anti-American sentiment sometimes found in Germany. A no less important factor is the roles the countries play in Trump’s vision of the world as a competition between great powers. He has singled out Germany as America’s main obstacle – even opponent – in Europe. Although his concerns about Germany’s large trade surplus and low defence expenditure are grounded in reality, Trump has criticised the country with an intensity that has chilled US-German relations for almost all his term. Within Trump’s narrative, a “very bad” Germany sharply contrasts with a reliable Poland, which meets NATO defence spending targets and is interested in an energy partnership with the US that would boost American liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports. Indeed, he has publicly courted the Polish authorities by visiting Warsaw in July 2017 and mentioning Poland as a key ally twice in his September 2018 speech before the UN General Assembly. Trump’s ideological similarities with the nationalist, populist Polish government and his differences with German Chancellor Angela Merkel – whom the international media has hailed as the last defender of the liberal order – are also crucial: while the Polish authorities saw Trump’s victory as continuing a political trend that began in Warsaw in 2015, the German political elite has publicly portrayed itself as fundamentally in conflict with the values and norms of the new America. Merkel’s remark that “the times in which we can completely rely on others are somewhat over” – made in Trudering in May 2017 – is perhaps the most famous expression of the transatlantic crisis. The fact that she is widely seen as a committed Transatlantikerin (her support for the Iraq war in 2003 put her at odds with then chancellor Gerhard Schröder and even public opinion) lends particular significance to her words. In a subsequent television interview, the chancellor said that Germany’s “second loyalty” (after loyalty to its people) should be to the EU – an important shift from the days in which she gave the EU and transatlantic relations equal weight. Merkel has not specified what Germany’s new strategy should look like, but she has conveyed German leaders’ overwhelming distrust and frustration with the Trump administration’s foreign policy. In Germany, Trump has become a symbol of a historic rupture with the US, heralding the end of the transatlantic era and of America’s role as the key guarantor of the multilateral liberal order and the only reliable pillar of European security. Indeed, as Maas wrote in August 2018, “the US and Europe have been drifting apart for years. There is less of an overlap in the values and interests that shaped our relationship for two generations.” Arguably, Trump’s behaviour has had a powerful impact on the Merkel government’s foreign policy, encouraging German leaders to echo French President Emmanuel Macron’s call for “European sovereignty”. Maas has set out to “reassess” Germany’s relationship with the US – and to create what he calls a “balanced partnership” in which Germany and Europe have an appropriate share of responsibility, and the EU can “form a counterweight when the US crosses red lines”. To this end, he has made substantive recommendations: establishing international payments and financial communications channels independent of the US; a European monetary fund; and a new alliance of multilateralists (comprising like-minded nations that oppose the US retreat from multilateral institutions). All in all, German leaders seek to address an “America First” foreign policy as a long-term challenge that requires Europe unity and resilience. Meanwhile, their Polish counterparts reject any narrative that focuses on America’s new unpredictability and desire for retrenchment. Warsaw largely views relations with Washington through the lens of security policy. Although the Polish public and government were unsettled by the possibility of American-Russian rapprochement at the beginning of Trump’s presidency, this has not come to pass. The Polish authorities have felt vindicated in their belief that Trump’s presidency would not – as leaders in Berlin worried – have negative consequences for Poland and Europe more broadly. Warsaw did not take Trump’s remark that “NATO is obsolete” entirely seriously, as the US remained committed to strengthening the Alliance’s eastern flank. Indeed, despite the disconcerting rhetoric, American contributions to Europe’s security have materially increased under Trump. And this is, as Polish diplomats and experts underline, a matter of hard facts rather than perceptions. Not only has Washington fulfilled the commitments it made at the 2014 NATO Summit in Wales; Trump has also declared that the US will increase the budget of the European Deterrence Initiative from $4.8bn in 2018 to $6.5bn in 2019. America is deploying another three brigades to Europe on a rotational basis, while pre-positioning additional ammunition and training equipment there. From the Polish government’s perspective, there is no reason to complain about US retrenchment. The American military presence, seen as the cornerstone of Poland’s security, includes a military hub in Powidz, a rotational heavy brigade in Zagan, the Redzikowo base of the European Phased Adaptive Approach anti-missile shield (designed to protect the entire alliance), and occasional aerial and naval patrols or naval patrols in the Baltic Sea. Furthermore, the 2018 US National Defense Strategy defines Russia as a “strategic adversary”, in line with threat perceptions in Warsaw. In fact, the Polish government is much more enthusiastic about the direction of Washington’s current policy than that under Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama, who attempted to “reset” American-Russian relations. Germany and France criticise American unilateralism for threatening the West’s unity, but Poland has other concerns. In Warsaw, political elites’ fear that America will betray Polish or European interests is weaker than their concern about the consequences of loosening transatlantic bonds. In other words, pushing European sovereignty as the medicine for the transatlantic crisis is seen as more dangerous than the disease it intends to cure. This scepticism about the direction of the western European debate about Trump and transatlantic relations only enhances Poland’s eagerness to strengthen its bilateral relationship with the US and position itself as Washington’s best ally in Europe. As such, Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Bartosz Cichocki has predicted that “in a few years’ time ... we can be in a completely different category of American allies” as “Poland is a kind of ‘substitute’ for the UK and Turkey in Europe.” This ambition has become the driving force of Poland’s foreign policy. It was on display during Duda’s visit to Washington in September 2018, where he signed a declaration on a US-Polish strategic partnership. Instead of pushing for the US to defend multilateralism, Warsaw has tended to cultivate the bilateral relationship and accept – willingly or otherwise – Trump’s new rules of the game. Polish Foreign Minister Jacek Czaputowicz acknowledged in a speech at the Stefan Batory Foundation in October 2018 that Trump has fundamentally changed the way that international politics works – and that Poland needs to adapt to this new reality. During his recent visit to Washington, Duda asserted that he pursues a “Poland First” policy. And, in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York, Duda did not echo his German counterpart’s call to defend multilateralism. Instead, he used the opportunity to criticise the current form of “multilateralism of usurpation and hierarchy”, contrasting this with “positive multilateralism of equal states and free nations” based upon the idea of “sovereign equality”. While Germany insists that the EU should establish strategic autonomy partly by taking foreign policy decisions through qualified majority voting, Warsaw perceives this as a threat to national sovereignty. The foreign policy tension between Warsaw and Berlin is most evident (and most problematic for Europe) in Trump’s rejection of the multilateral Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) on Iran’s nuclear programme. Germany has been at the forefront of EU efforts to establish a special purpose vehicle (SPV) designed to circumvent US sanctions on European companies that deal with Iran, while Polish diplomats regard any measures directed against the US as unacceptable. This may be at least partly because the SPV might also be used to circumvent potential US sanctions on European (particularly German) companies involved in the Nord Stream 2 energy pipeline project – which Poland has encouraged Washington to oppose. Therefore, on the JCPOA as other areas, the Trump administration’s foreign and security policy could have profound implications for EU cohesion. The American president’s criticism of low European (especially German) military expenditure and his ambiguous comments about NATO have lent new impetus to the debate on European defence. For France, the debate is about autonomy; for Germany, it is about responsibility. Meanwhile, Poland and several other countries have criticised the EU’s renewed interest in military cooperation for potentially undermining NATO. Arguably, it is inconceivable that Europeans would have engaged in so many political declarations and substantive projects – such as Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) and the European Intervention Initiative (E2I) – in their current form and scope without Trump’s interventions. In this way, security and defence policy has become an unexpectedly promising avenue for European integration. European countries now broadly accept the idea that they should do more on defence. However, the speed and form of this “more” are no less contentious than they were before Trump entered the White House. In fact, Trump’s behaviour has exacerbated the differences between some EU member states – not least Poland and Germany (as well as Poland and France). In a nutshell, the more Germany and France engaged in discussions about a “European army” or “common defence” as a response to what they perceive as the new transatlantic reality, the more Poland has emphasised the primacy of NATO and sought a closer relationship with America. Poland has long been concerned that the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) would weaken the transatlantic alliance by needlessly duplicating NATO structures and capabilities. One of the first decisions the PiS government made was to cancel its predecessor’s order of French Caracal helicopters, thereby damaging security cooperation with Paris and undermining Warsaw’s credibility within the EU. Poland only joined PESCO reluctantly and at the last minute (perhaps with the aim of watering down the project). And the country has traditionally preferred to work with US defence companies rather than their western European competitors – regardless of who occupied the White House. Poland’s long-standing concerns about the CSDP have grown due to its European partners’ response to the apparent shift in US policy on Europe under Trump. France’s dominant role in the response has played a particularly significant part in this. Macron pushed for greater European sovereignty in defence by advocating for an ambitious version of PESCO and launching the contentious E2I. Designed as an intergovernmental “coalition of the willing” outside the EU’s legal framework, the E2I came in response to France’s failure to found PESCO as an exclusive group of countries that had similar threat perceptions and were able to develop common defence capabilities. The version of PESCO the EU eventually adopted reflected Germany’s thinking more than that of France: while Paris was mainly interested in creating EU military capabilities and structures, Berlin focused on the political effects of the CSDP as a vehicle for EU integration. Berlin’s support for broad participation in PESCO – including countries as sceptical of the project as Poland – caused Paris to turn to other initiatives. Thus, while France may not have been entirely successful in pushing its defence agenda, it has undoubtedly driven efforts to respond to Trump’s challenge to Europe. For Poland and other countries in eastern Europe, the fact that the UK played no role in these defence cooperation plans and discussions was also important. As a pillar of the transatlantic relationship, the UK has long been a respected security partner in the region. In line with Warsaw’s identification of London as a key ally, the sides finalised a bilateral security partnership agreement in December 2017. The UK’s decision to leave the EU likely helped spur the deal, as it will leave the bloc with one less strong advocate for ensuring NATO remains Europe’s primary security provider. Meanwhile, Germany has limited its involvement in the debate on European defence cooperation due to the peculiarities of its approach to security policy. Supporting the establishment of a European army has long been part of the electoral platforms of both the Social Democrats and the Christian Democrats (as reflected in their current coalition agreement). However, this vision rarely guides policy planning. Mostly interested in the political dimension of the CSDP, Berlin has welcomed European defence cooperation as a form of integration that would strengthen the EU rather than as a tool to develop shared military capabilities. Equally, Germany lacks a strategic culture with clearly defined security goals and an understanding of the instruments needed to achieve them (France, in contrast, has always had a clear idea about the threats it wanted an upgraded CSDP to address). And the poor condition of the German armed forces – which German politician Hans-Peter Bartels has described as of ‘limited use’ – undermines Berlin’s credibility as a security policy actor. As a result of these factors, Germany has oscillated between passivity and control in the European defence cooperation debate. Although Merkel has used Macron’s language on defence issues – most strikingly, in repeating Macron’s call for a European army in November 2018 – Germany has always worked to prevent the establishment of an exclusive PESCO or any other EU defence project it perceives as too disconnected from the transatlantic relationship. Nonetheless, Berlin has had little active input in the policy debate – a fact that only strengthens Polish elites’ belief that the idea of ‘European defence’ is largely a French post-transatlanticist project. Therefore, Poland joined two PESCO projects in 2017 and six more a year later with the explicit goal of strengthening the European contribution to NATO and preventing the creation of autonomous European capabilities. Warsaw’s main concern about PESCO has been that joint EU capability planning would undermine collective territorial defence, as western European countries would be more interested in developing military capabilities designed for crisis management and foreign intervention (particularly in north Africa) rather than those for responding to Russian aggression. This gap between eastern and western European countries’ threat perceptions is key to the differences in their approaches to, and expectations of, PESCO – as seen in Poland’s suggestion that the project should even include non-EU members. As Minister of Defence Mateusz Blaszczak stated : “I mean here the US in the first place, but also Norway and the UK after Brexit.” Unsurprisingly, France did not invite Poland to join the E2I. In November 2018, Macron went a step further, arguing : “what I don’t want to see is European countries increasing the budget in defence in order to buy Americans’ and other arms or materials coming from your industry. I think if we increase our budget, it’s to have to build our autonomy and to become an actual sovereign power.” This definition of European sovereignty is anathema to Warsaw, especially at a time when it is negotiating a major deal to procure the US Patriot missile-defence system. Polish daily Rzeczpospolita  responded to the French president with a sentiment many Polish leaders share: “Macron’s activities are the reason why the future of NATO and the security of central eastern Europe are becoming even more dependent on the US”. Indeed, while French and German thinking about strategic autonomy is based on the assumption that the EU can no longer fully rely on the US, the shift in Poland’s security policy towards transatlanticist or even Polish-American solutions is increasingly apparent. Like Trump’s verbal attacks on Germany, disputes within NATO about defence spending and Europe’s responsibilities have made the Alliance seem vulnerable and prompted Warsaw to mediate its security relationship with Washington through bilateral channels. The PiS government celebrated Trump’s July 2017 visit to Poland for the Three Seas Initiative (TSI) Summit – during which the president delivered what his adviser Steve Bannon called his “most important foreign policy speech” – as its main foreign policy success, despite the fact that it had no tangible results. Nonetheless, Duda used his September 2018 visit to Washington to invite the US to set up a permanent American military base in Poland, colloquially known as “ Fort Trump ”, and offered to contribute $2bn to the initiative. In line with this, the replacement of rotating US military deployments on Polish soil (as agreed at the 2016 NATO Summit in Wales) with a permanent one has become one of the main declared goals of Polish security policy. Poland’s insistence on a permanent American presence stems from its interpretation of Russian strategic thinking. According to Polish experts, the Kremlin views rotational deployments as a limited commitment – in both scope and time. As such, a permanent presence serves as a more effective deterrent. Warsaw does not accept the argument often put forward by German politicians that deploying American or NATO forces at the Alliance’s eastern flank would violate the provisions of the 1997 NATO-Russia Founding Act. Yet, from Warsaw’s perspective, Russia has repeatedly voided the agreement by changing the security environment, not least with its invasion of Ukraine and militarisation of Kaliningrad. However, it is political rather than legal issues that make Fort Trump divisive within the EU and NATO. A bilateral deal on a permanent American military deployment in Poland would erode the carefully constructed consensus between the country’s NATO allies. To be sure, the Polish government has stressed that Fort Trump would be based on an arrangement that did not require their consent: Czaputowicz told NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg in October 2018 that they would merely “be informed” about the talks with the US, arguing that a permanent deployment would strengthen the Alliance as a whole. Germany disagrees (as does France). Aside from the fact that it could be militarily counterproductive , establishing a permanent American base on Polish soil outside the NATO framework would be politically costly for Poland. By betting on an unequal bilateral alliance and alienating Germany and France, Poland could quickly become a dependent client of America – under Trump or subsequent presidents. Warsaw can be useful to the Trump administration in reducing the EU’s cohesion, thereby preventing unified European opposition to Washington on issues such as the INF Treaty and the JCPOA. In this way, concessions the US might extract from Poland in talks on Fort Trump could affect how the EU approaches these areas. Polish excitement about Fort Trump may well turn out to be premature even if, as expected, the US boosts its military deployments to Poland without establishing a permanent presence there. Trump seems reluctant to send more troops abroad without having a good cause for doing so – not least because of his campaign promises on this. He seems likely to portray Poland’s request as evidence of the success of his tough approach to NATO and European defence spending. The prospect of a permanent base may end up as a bargaining chip in NATO’s internal debates – or even in US-Russian discussions. Trump’s announcement in October 2018 that the US would withdraw from the INF Treaty could set Poland and Germany on opposite sides of a crucial European security debate. Signed in 1987 by US President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, the treaty prohibits America and Russia from developing and deploying land-based missiles with a range of 500-5,500km. As it bans the weapons the countries could use to fight a “limited” nuclear war in Europe, the agreement is widely perceived as a cornerstone of European security. Trump’s announcement, therefore, partially decoupled European and American security interests, with potentially catastrophic consequences. Freed from the limits of the INF Treaty, Moscow could openly deploy intermediate-range land-based missiles capable of hitting targets across Europe from within mainland Russia, prompting a US response and increasing the likelihood of a new nuclear arms race beyond the US and Russia. The US government has publicly accused Russia of spurning the treaty, partly by testing a cruise missile that exceeds INF limits, since 2014. However, there has been only a muted reaction from European countries as many of them have no way of independently verifying American intelligence on the missile – the SSC-8, a successor of the SS-20, which became the focal point of nuclear competition between the Soviet Union and the West in the 1970s and the 1980s. While Warsaw has voiced its concerns about the issue, Berlin initially described the evidence on the tests from American intelligence as “not unambiguous”. The German government then went further, responding to a parliamentary question from Die Linke’s Kleine Anfrage with the claim that the development of the SSC-8 did violate the INF Treaty. The silence of European leaders such as Merkel and Macron on the issue and Russia’s broader military build-up has long disappointed Warsaw. Trump’s announcement about the INF Treaty has met with criticism in Germany. But there is no German public debate on the threat Iskanders deployed to Kaliningrad or other Russian missiles could pose to German cities. This is partly because Berlin believes there is little chance that Moscow will launch an attack and partly because German political discourse on nuclear weapons is still heavily influenced by the Nachrüstungsdebatte (rearmament debate) that took place in West Germany in the 1980s. In that era, the West German government led by Chancellor Helmut Schmidt demanded that NATO respond to the deployment of the SS-20. With the US seemingly reluctant to react, Schmidt feared that the American nuclear guarantee to Europe would not hold without the deployment of a Western system that would deter the Soviets from using the new missile. The Alliance’s double-track decision in 1979 – which combined an offer of talks to the Soviet Union with the deployment of US Pershing II missiles in Germany – led to the collapse of Schmidt’s coalition government two years later. (His party, the Social Democrats, refused to support the deployment after it provoked the largest demonstrations in West German history and generated widespread public hostility to the US). Ever since, support for nuclear and other forms of arms control and disarmament has been one of the key features of Germany’s security policy and political culture. Against this background, the German public misread the discussions between Reagan and Gorbachev in Reykjavik in 1986, which eventually led to the INF Treaty, as a triumph of reason over the madness of nuclear arms races. In fact, the deal was a return to the status quo ante in nuclear deterrence. Thus, Maas responded to Trump’s declaration about the INF by claiming that Germany “would fight with all available diplomatic means to defend the treaty”. Former Social Democrat leaders published a joint letter in which they warned against a new arms race and called upon Europe and Germany to be the voice of “disarmament and common security”. “Russia and the United States accuse each other of violating the INF”, they wrote , envisaging Europe as a neutral intermediary between the powers. Meanwhile, the Greens reiterated their stance that the US should withdraw the 350 or so nuclear missiles it has stationed in Germany. Poland’s foreign ministry was far more conciliatory, stating that it agreed with the American assessment that Russia had violated the INF Treaty and, as a consequence, understood Trump’s move. (Minister Czaputowicz added that US withdrawal from the INF would not threaten Poland’s security because no new American intermediate-range missile would be used against Poland.) However, it is not Berlin’s and Warsaw’s differing views of the US decision and Russia’s alleged treaty violations that threaten to become the main point of contention, either bilaterally or within NATO and the EU. The most divisive issue is likely to be the effect of US withdrawal from the INF Treaty on Europe’s security environment. The American decision needs to be seen in its wider strategic context. China – whose tactical nuclear weapons threaten US allies in the Pacific while America’s hands are bound by INF Treaty restrictions – is likely to be the real target of Trump’s decision. Nonetheless, the US has for some time considered a change in its nuclear strategy to address Russia’s military build-up. Indeed, the country’s February 2018 Nuclear Posture Review advocates strengthening American nuclear tactical capabilities through the deployment of sea-based missiles (which the INF Treaty does not cover). Yet, even before Trump became president, the US had mulled responding to Russia’s INF violations with the development and deployment of new land-based intermediate-range missiles. Following his announcement about the INF Treaty, it seems that the US will choose the latter option to redress the nuclear imbalance in Europe. This debate could deepen the mistrust and misunderstanding between Poland and Germany, preventing the EU and NATO from formulating a common response to the challenges of a future arms race. In fact, from Warsaw’s perspective, a new arms race has already started – with the West remaining passive as the threat from Russia grows. Poland is particularly concerned about Russia’s military build-up in Kaliningrad and what it sees as the “nuclearisation” of Russian military doctrine. Unlike Germany, Poland has no aversion to nuclear weapons and still sees itself as a second-tier NATO member because it does not host permanent deployments of American missiles or troops. Warsaw rejects German criticism of efforts to strengthen NATO in ways that could violate the 1997 NATO-Russia Founding Act, not least because Germany hosts large numbers of US troops and equipment. For the Polish government, this allows Germany to feel safe in a manner that Poland cannot. However, the gap between Polish and German threat perceptions is even more fundamental than this. Warsaw sees its principal goal of further strengthening the NATO and US military presence on its soil as the only logical response to the current military imbalance between NATO and Russia, and the lasting military imbalance between Poland and Russia. In contrast, Berlin believes that increasing the American military presence in Poland would threaten the country – by prompting further Russian escalation. Breaching the NATO-Russia Founding Act would, so the German argument goes, cause Moscow to retaliate by amassing even more troops in Kaliningrad and, possibly, Belarus. This would make Poland (and Europe) less secure. The announced American withdrawal from the INF Treaty makes a collision between these differing philosophies more likely. Because they believe an arms race is already under way, some PiS leaders claim that Trump’s decision could even provide an opportunity to restore the strategic balance, with Poland playing a key role in this by hosting “rapid reaction forces on its territory in [Fort Trump] as well as missile forces to deter Russia”. Trump’s behaviour has also driven a wedge between Poland and Germany on energy policy. To be sure, the countries’ conflicting views on cooperation with Russia and the importance of renewables have often put them at loggerheads with each other bilaterally and in the EU. This tension has considerably intensified in the last two years – and not only because of Trump. The key problem has been Nord Stream 2, which provoked heated arguments and legal disputes as it entered its final stage. However, Trump supercharged this controversy with an unprecedented (business-orientated) intervention on the topic, as well as his broader attitude towards Germany. Energy has played an important role in the debate about the trade imbalance between the US and Europe. Trump’s strategy for reducing America’s trade deficit has been not only to impose tariffs and other restrictions on imports but also to increase American exports in lucrative sectors such as LNG. Thus, boosting European imports of American LNG has become a priority of his European policy – one that fits neatly with his depiction of Germany as America’s key adversary in Europe, not at least due to its huge trade surplus. Berlin supports Nord Stream 2, as it would make Germany the hub of central European gas supply lines. But the project would also cause EU member states, especially those in central and eastern Europe, to be more dependent on Russian gas imports. Geopolitics aside, Trump believes that it is not in America’s economic interest for Europe to establish a closer energy partnership with Russia or for Germany to strengthen its economic position in central and eastern Europe. And Nord Stream 2, which is scheduled to become fully operational by the end of 2019, has remained a divisive issue within the EU. While some, especially Germany and Austria, openly support the project, others – mostly Poland and Baltic states, but also the European Commission – oppose it. Moreover, the development of LNG infrastructure (with terminals in Swinoujscie and Krk) is a priority of the TSI – a project involving countries on the Baltic, Adriatic, and Black seas that Germany has long viewed as an attempt to build an alliance within the EU, thereby weakening the bloc. Trump, who has never concealed his contempt for European integration, likely sees playing on these divisions as a means of enhancing US influence in Europe. Warsaw doubtlessly hopes that American criticism of Nord Stream 2 will be decisive in the long dispute over the project. Supported by nine other EU member states, Poland has long opposed Nord Stream 2 for: weakening Ukraine, which currently exacts transit fees on Russian gas exports to Europe; working against the EU’s goal of diversifying its energy supplies away from Russia; and violating the Third Energy Package, which requires “unbundling”, or dividing energy extraction and distribution between different companies. However, these complaints have not had the desired result. Berlin remains unimpressed with Warsaw’s arguments about the security risks of Nord Stream 2, though some influential voices in the German debate support this point of view. Most importantly, an attempt to use legal arguments to prevent the pipeline from being built, or at least render the project financially unsustainable, has failed too. In September 2017, the EU Council’s legal service rejected (on Germany’s insistence, according to Der Spiegel ) the European Commission’s request to allow it to negotiate a special arrangement with Russia on behalf of EU member states. The Commission also proposed an amendment to the Third Energy Package that would have required Nord Stream 2 to fully comply with the EU legislation, substantially increasing costs for the pipeline consortium. In March 2018, the EU Council’s legal service also rejected this initiative, dealing a powerful blow to Warsaw’s hopes. (Under proposed changes to the gas directive, all import pipelines would have to not be owned directly by gas suppliers, and would have to maintain non-discriminatory tariffs, transparent operations, and 10 percent capacity for third parties.) Having lost the battle within the EU, US interest in EU pipeline politics provides Warsaw with one last chance to derail the project. It became clear that Warsaw might be able to count on US support in January 2018, when Rex Tillerson, then US secretary of state, visited Poland. Tillerson said that Nord Stream 2 is “undermining Europe’s overall energy stability and security” and that the US would “continue to take steps [to prevent it] as we can”. In an interview published shortly afterwards, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki urged the US administration to impose sanctions on the companies involved in the project. The issue of possible American punishment hit the headlines after Trump lashed out at Germany ahead of the NATO Summit in July 2018, calling Berlin “captive of Russia” and “totally controlled by Russia” while criticising the planned pipeline as “very inappropriate”. While Merkel emphasised that Berlin would make “autonomous decisions” on energy supply and German business representatives claimed that Trump’s threats “encroach on European energy policy”, Poland pinned its hopes on American determination to cancel Nord Stream 2. Indeed, during a visit to Warsaw in November 2018, US Energy Secretary Rick Perry confirmed that the US could still impose sanctions on companies involved in the project. The dispute over potential US sanctions has driven a wedge between Poland and Germany, deepening mistrust between them more than any other issue. For Poland, sanctions provide its last chance to achieve a strategic goal; for Germany, the US threat of such measures is unacceptable interference in the EU’s internal affairs and German economic interests. Berlin also sees Warsaw’s drive for sanctions as completely unacceptable. As German diplomat Wolfgang Ischinger argued , Trump’s behaviour is pushing Germany “towards Russia and China”. Poland’s strategic interest in energy cooperation with the US extends beyond Nord Stream 2. Warsaw rejected the new pipeline for not only geopolitical but also economic reasons – with American LNG imports playing an important role in its energy security calculations. Poland intends to allow its contract with Gazprom to expire in 2022, making it fully independent of Russian energy imports. The country will replace around 10 billion cubic metres of Russian gas per year with Norwegian gas imported through the planned Baltic Pipe, as well as LNG from various – ideally, American – companies. Swinoujscie’s LNG terminal has the capacity of 6bcm and is already operational. According to some Polish government sources, LNG imports and the Baltic Pipe could also help Poland become a gas hub in central and eastern Europe. The relatively high prices of LNG and Norwegian gas could prevent this from happening, as could a lack of interest in buying “Polish” gas in the region. However, long-term contracts with Gazprom linked to Nord Stream 2 would undoubtedly destroy any hope of achieving this goal. [2] Therefore, Trump’s interest in promoting American LNG exports aligns with Polish strategic aims, creating common ground for an energy partnership. In November 2018, Polish state-owned energy giant PGNiG signed a 24-year LNG import contract with US firm Cheniere – under which, from 2023, Poland will buy 2bcm of LNG per year from the Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi terminals, in the Gulf of Mexico. The previous month, Poland signed a contract with US firm Venture Global LNG for 2bcm of LNG per year from 2022. The country is also negotiating two other contracts. While the exact price of the gas is not publicly known, PGNiG claims that it is 20-30 percent lower than that of Russian gas. As part of the TSI, the energy partnership with America largely aligns with infrastructure projects between northern and southern European countries. Although Poland aims to become a hub for distributing gas across the region through the TSI, this would require further integration and an estimated €615bn in transportation infrastructure investment before 2025. Berlin worries that, in addition to weakening the unity of the EU, the TSI will undermine Germany’s political relationship with central and eastern Europe. This runs counter to Berlin’s strategic aim of remaining anchored in Europe’s east and west. While the Polish government has stressed the purely infrastructural character of the project, many PiS politicians and advisers have described the TSI as a plan B for Europe, should the EU collapse. To strengthen its position as a regional leader and counterbalance Germany and France, Poland has encouraged the US to endorse the TSI and invest in the project. Trump’s July 2017 visit to Warsaw to attend the TSI Summit appeared to signal that the initiative has American support. So did his energy secretary’s visit to the TSI Summit in Bucharest in September 2018. However, the US has not announced any major investments in the TSI aside from those linked to LNG cooperation. As a result, its advocates hope that the EU will back projects in the framework of the TSI. Both European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and the Maas attended the Bucharest summit as observers. While Germany has shifted towards supporting the TSI (to avoid being left out), Poland would still prefer to work with the US on the project. Trump’s behaviour has undoubtedly driven Berlin and Warsaw further apart on a range of issues. Weakening the consensus between European countries and undermining the EU appears to be the deliberate policy of the current US administration. Yet divisions between Berlin and Warsaw over transatlantic issues have at least as much to do with their long-held views of US policy, the EU, and NATO. Another principal obstacle is the pervasive mistrust between the German and Polish governments, which shapes their perceptions of each other. To put it bluntly, Germany sees the current Polish government as undermining the cohesion of Europe and ignoring the normative and legal obligations of EU membership. For Berlin, Warsaw seeks to roll back political integration while retaining all the benefits of membership, not least financial support. In contrast, Poland sees Germany as claiming a hegemonic role in Europe, using its control over institutions in Brussels to force its preferences on others. Given these irreconcilable positions, Polish-German disputes over how to respond to changes in transatlantic relations should come as no surprise. Both sides should work to narrow the gap between them. German leaders have no interest in ending their partnership with Poland, as this would have far-reaching implications for Germany’s role in its eastern neighbourhood. Determined to contain centrifugal forces within the EU, Berlin aims to promote the benefits of shared sovereignty. Equally, Polish leaders have no interest in alienating their country’s most important economic partner. A cooperative Germany is Poland’s bridge to the west; a distant Germany could be a barricade. Both need each other, albeit for somewhat different reasons – Poland’s dependence on Germany is mostly economic, while Germany’s dependence on Poland is mostly political. Nonetheless, current trends suggest that the bilateral relationship will deteriorate further. Avoiding this outcome will require a new strategy and significant political will. The latter is in short supply, especially in Poland. But Germany and Poland can reconcile at least some of their interests – to the benefit of both them and the wider EU. Initially, this effort should involve the following steps: Relations between Germany and Poland are too important to their broader interests – and to the cohesion of the EU – to be allowed to deteriorate further. Berlin and Warsaw both aim to shape the EU’s policies and institutions, even if they have profoundly different goals and strategies. Failure to address their differences and to overcome obstacles to cooperation would hamper both on the European stage – albeit in an asymmetric way, given the disparities between them in size, strength, and influence. As the fabric of EU cooperation is made up of strong bilateral relationships, neither Warsaw nor Berlin can afford to waste the potential of a once-productive partnership.
